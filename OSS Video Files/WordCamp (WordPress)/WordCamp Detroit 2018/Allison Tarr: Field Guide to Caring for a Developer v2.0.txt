Title: Allison Tarr: Field Guide to Caring for a Developer v2.0
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	Surrounded by constant workflow advancements, new frameworks, and version updates, tech culture often makes exhaustion a badge of honour. How do we best take care of ourselves when faced with obstacles like burnout, isolation, and uncertainty?
Whether you’re a remote employee, freelancer, or working within a larger tech team, striving towards a greater understanding of mental health supports the sustainability of both individuals and the industry as a whole. In this talk, I’ll discuss my own lived experience as well as examine the state of mental health awareness within tech.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,570
Wilbur 2.0 out of your speaker is

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,150
awesome tire

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,820
Ellison is a feminist if you perverts

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,890
and in front-end developer who fully

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,410
discussed this phone call

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,560
she was what holy hula-hoops can Dolly

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,779
Parton not necessarily as a result of

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,810
our homeland experience combating stigma

00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:31,550
house encourages more open conversation

00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:36,610
provide additional resources to create a

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,610
sustainable sizes network is independent

00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,159
[Applause]

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,540
[Music]

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:23,720
really tech industry as a whole other

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,909
over or designer I love these things

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,270
still speak to the industry of that art

00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:32,000
rather than just if you do cover them

00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,520
and so her so what we're going to talk

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,920
about that are those resistance her go

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,310
over some of the lines and how many went

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:49,280
towards she just came and it won't be so

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:50,719
dry right now it's pretty awesome

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:59,950
you've already heard a little bit about

00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:59,950
me so sometime in them

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:09,910
so you learned that the mish-mosh writer

00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:13,420
obviously mental health advocates many

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,980
things and one of the things that's I

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,019
want to over and free

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,330
Diamond is that I don't know anyone that

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:22,150
is clear with the podcast called strong

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,760
unless that's a podcast about feels so

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,290
good right up my alley

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,519
definitely my house the middle kind of a

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:52,720
disclaimer at the beginning so I'm not a

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:56,709
psychologist experience so somewhere

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,410
that like experience or your own history

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,450
could be potentially triggering so here

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,190
is it's a plank this talks about your

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,620
juniors not paint in it

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:10,859
feel free to that they talk about them

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:13,739
you don't feel pressure to say I don't

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,970
you didn't take care of yourself

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,769
so a little bit more about me and my

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,720
obligations and foremost to the

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:22,480
portraits I didn't know he's working

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,220
Tech and I got relevant arts i comes

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,950
from a smattering of different job

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:32,139
titles and break I'm gonna chat a little

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:35,019
teacher and so I didn't grow up so

00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:40,329
clearly I just chose that I think that's

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:42,760
right this was a rap line but I'm here

00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:43,060
because I want to help people feel less

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,799
alone

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,569
I think it's not something that's

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,340
discussed in them I want their

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,260
demonstate mob talking about mental

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,940
health and I want to bring it more to

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,819
look forward to be especially the

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,040
thumbtack because integra fact that

00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,190
there are certain things that are

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,830
normalized and brought brought forward

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,100
standards which still certainly to be

00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,230
and the dough benefit for a long-term

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,660
sustainability so that mentioned that

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,600
have lived experience it started when I

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,100
was a teenager and for a while I was

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,280
written on his way to the pool teenage

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,280
Hanks I'm saying so sort of like check

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,910
out this bill this is like all that

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,790
having having that like a CD testing

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,630
boundaries time shall we say and maybe

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,040
teenager granted certainly not a stroke

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,700
regardless of whether not you're dealing

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,160
with additional issues but I thought

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,660
that what I was feeling was normal

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,980
because people around me

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,590
normal I said as a as a face eventually

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,510
what's good news for me at a time but

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,340
unfortunately it wasn't taken seriously

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,520
in the way that they're not media

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,770
supports health that being said I was

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,780
lucky enough and privileged enough that

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,840
my support systems eventually were like

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:07,570
she's not this isn't shifting and it's

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,160
getting worse it works I was I thought

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,169
the thoughts of the place suicidal

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,419
ideation and thinks of I was thinking

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,360
were normal and I just thought that I

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:19,270
wasn't as strong as ever

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,010
this is a typical teenage thing and I

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,720
just was thinking what everyone else

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,950
must be having these thoughts to and

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,440
we're just dealing with that I'm were

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,510
like trying out for teen we serve

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,910
they're just dealing with it for some

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,980
reason I'm not cool to probably what I

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,020
did was is that well my thoughts were

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,000
much different than just like the

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,160
typical teenage thought process it was

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,650
much more thoroughly than angst and all

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,440
that but that makes that I have even

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,150
they did you realize oh it's just me

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,430
they are not strong enough to deal with

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,160
whatever else environment like par for

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,560
the course and once that most things

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,590
became even a little more I was lucky

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,720
enough to receive access which I know

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:02,440
there's a bit of pros and cons to

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,860
diagnosis from like being put in a box

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,350
is necessarily not necessarily and they

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,159
feel let it for me it was a beneficial

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,169
thing because I might men's Oh

00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:17,409
I suppose once you give a name to

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:19,569
something it's a lot more clearly where

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,069
you can take it a lot more clearly where

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:26,169
we think about this and there's probably

00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:28,929
a solution something like again I can

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:34,059
figure this out but the adults around me

00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:36,999
their reaction was more complicated

00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:39,969
because basically I was told to not talk

00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:42,569
about it just like okay well now you

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:45,699
have this thing but they don't tell me

00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:49,050
mention another in your college essay or

00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:52,360
like application it's not like this

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:56,019
theory and then the other problem places

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,269
the up because they do that potential

00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:01,240
reactions and how people react but also

00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:03,459
I mean having that impose on you from

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,800
girls in your life has like a

00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:07,749
long-lasting effect as far as where you

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,339
then take that experience and again that

00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:11,079
internalization of the state not like

00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:12,909
completely process to talk about these

00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,379
things it's just something that maybe

00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,419
you talk about with your doctor you're

00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:19,869
lucky and then you move on and just sort

00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:28,169
of cope with it as you go so what I was

00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:36,039
told so often I had this issue wouldn't

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:40,269
work towards solving it and so not just

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:45,669
have it saw stigma and so I think the

00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:47,860
statuses for diagnosis and we did not I

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:51,189
just I feel like and this kind of goes

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,309
to the tech industry as a whole as well

00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:57,969
as for an identity we're still the Lions

00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:59,860
on our brain starting today and thus

00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:02,110
that's how we make our lives need to

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,909
solve puzzles get to the body problem

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:08,700
it's like just really like it get to the

00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:11,530
bottom of untangling

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,850
we're also so much more than that so if

00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,070
you have these different first-rate

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,320
deputies that don't necessarily come up

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,480
in our day-to-day as a coder its own

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,430
interesting project finish but there are

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,919
these these things them to come into

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,080
play whereas it had more than just like

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,160
that excuse are someone with depression

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:34,960
and anxiety but I'm also all these other

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,150
things is this with a so many people

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,440
with mental health issues and I have to

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,120
acknowledge you know that it's important

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,950
to remember of that until all the she

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,960
could be a diagnosis or it could be

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:47,080
situational days you could have had a

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,680
loss it could be something that's less

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,870
what they would think chair monitor

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,300
ongoing and more situational and that's

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,480
still something that you don't

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,960
necessarily need proper diagnosis

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,420
Hornets love your table experience so

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,279
awake most people with nothing else

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,950
announced to add to the stories so

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:12,100
what's your school two years ago Henry

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,880
last which resulted in suicide and

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,610
across relaxed and that was a major we

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,920
go poverty because I realized that you

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,920
to increase Magdalene surround myself

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,310
here and be a lot more aware as far as

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,730
outside influences as well as mine what

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,800
I was like promoting our lives and for

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,560
self-care an int evening a certain

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,990
puzzle tall and I rely for making

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,610
deliberate choices and how like how I

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,170
would carry those out of the actual

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:54,820
actions rather than be like my core

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:57,940
values er you know x y&z how do I want

00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:02,200
to relate those actual and actionable

00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:04,810
tasks so that once at all all the other

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,160
present work have so many good times in

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,160
the past years I traveled

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,830
[Applause]

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,930
and it's implanted to me because they

00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,870
deal with every day and it also has

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:43,530
additional shipping and is the member

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:46,470
agency goodness it still does and more

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:51,600
so I noticed it at night moves into the

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:54,000
tech space because not all of those the

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,350
expectations of the tech space well not

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,080
necessarily drop something different

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,510
than that stay like another like a bank

00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,070
or another kind of industry but there

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,530
were certain expectations there they

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,230
made it even more difficult to adapt

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:11,670
into and bring those elements of self

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,920
care intellect and work and I think it's

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:17,040
I just want to be able to talk about it

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:21,090
more because anything I know it's not

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,590
just me and I know that the first that

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,360
is having those conversations and

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:28,460
teaching people to go Cavallari

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,630
that will talk about it and how because

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,640
it takes a lot of times people just

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,220
don't wear together even though we kind

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,380
of can identify the people that's like

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,440
kind of a these are the three see how

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,660
these conversations with but people they

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,910
also know we're safe they just don't

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:49,680
have the Intel to take it further

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,960
so of the stats so even younger

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,970
communities of young tech industry these

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,570
are real issues that just aren't being

00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,400
talked about so one in five separate

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,640
results for living with mental illness

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,550
at any time and that's not necessarily

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,310
diagnosed it could also be situational

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:10,710
so chances are you don't consciously

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,220
know someone you're like I could be your

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,220
five

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:24,270
over 5,000 penis working to the restroom

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:28,250
and that's a lot of missing and these

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,250
are just keep in mind all the statistics

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,630
people want to hearing this information

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,450
so these are people who are only

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,330
happiness rather than the actual

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,380
statistics so this could very well be a

00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:45,300
fraction of the actual people who are

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:49,500
are not only up to the actual reason

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:53,279
servicing so one it estimated that more

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:56,520
than fifty billion dollars is the cost

00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:01,260
of the asset is productivity so better

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:04,920
health entails lower total medical costs

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,790
and even if we don't want to they don't

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,560
want to make a blanket statement

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,820
whatever got to since we're all in a

00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:16,980
word camp feel like a real unit as far

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,720
as really being empathy and even if you

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,390
don't want to take it as a on a

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,520
person-to-person level the cost of doing

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,830
business

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:30,000
you're losing right by not supporting

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:31,560
painting style use and Deborah's it

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,900
benefits your employees other

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,130
contributions are value and in a way

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,350
where they're able to take care of their

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,970
own needs and so they can actually

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:43,800
contributing about your business so I

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,839
want to talk about it they don't want

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,440
people to think for less than and I

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:53,600
totally it I don't win the stumble let's

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
upside there I'm like got some nursing

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:04,650
we don't think we don't else and so so

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:07,110
much of our so much of our self-worth

00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,050
cannot be tied to what we do

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,660
it's about no code about me we're

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,870
positioning ourselves

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,790
I'm gonna start team let's your user put

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,040
it on king of all the things and then

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,950
most of the time in movies super trivia

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,560
if you didn't know all the things

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:29,420
because we all have different strengths

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,580
and weaknesses and absolute paints of

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,850
strontium is strong teams equals almost

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,560
acts collaborating in moments of varying

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,240
lengths where we all down we're able to

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,980
do that when team members are able to

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,580
link with dissolving this one message

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,350
show us our strengths so we'll need to

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,510
talk about it like they aren't quite

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,300
sure where to begin what questions to

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:53,660
ask or if it's okay to discuss with you

00:14:50,300 --> 00:15:29,480
and also if I could point out that it's

00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:33,920
and that's it's not it's not because I

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,710
don't know any issue be like having that

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,350
extra comfort to be able say I just

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:44,060
really need to do herself compact ready

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:45,770
ready to go mental illness is that comes

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:50,320
in the sense of it shouldn't happen to

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:53,750
you so that is a bit assault militant or

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,420
competence are there's like tons of in

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,570
about sharing an adventure so and

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:02,690
oftentimes without invisibility of

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,460
minutes without physical signs and

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,200
symptoms people don't meet those

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,450
connections because we're so users need

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,540
to see something to have to be able to

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:16,390
forget and then again that being said so

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,390
much physical symptoms can be confessed

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,799
[Applause]

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,940
[Music]

00:16:50,690 --> 00:17:14,339
Quintanilla reach as far as comparison

00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:34,490
but as far as people approach that was

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:38,070
hilarious also reach that similarity of

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,930
the other expectations of certain

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,990
segments of old certain technology

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:46,170
constantly seeking classes to meet some

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:50,240
threshold and move on - that's not

00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,240
anything - she was

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:24,180
you said your enormous festival top like

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:25,980
this cost container and most so most is

00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,470
to be the formal conversation they don't

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,620
have a policy in place they haven't even

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,630
mentioned that and this one know the

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,020
difference in numbers between the men

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:41,130
toll on Pacifica here as well as the

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,420
maybes because the difference in Mike do

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,430
you think especially mental health

00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:50,550
disorder with your employer's disorder

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:54,180
that assuredness of how much disappear

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:55,860
react also is really talent because that

00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,600
would be really distinctly reaching out

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,150
for help or support so that means that

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,380
the mental health issue you're

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:11,400
intelligent like reasonable

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:13,940
accommodation is plastic surgeries and

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,320
people earning out it's not sustainable

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,040
the industry's expanding at an

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,270
incredible rate

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,280
which is great for high rates but needs

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,100
people who are experienced to keep those

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,870
wheels in motion and people who are

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,930
experienced maintain levels of

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:34,650
effectiveness in order to continue

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:36,480
knowledge sharing the tech mystery won't

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,960
be able to rely on an influx of new

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,180
developers the work comes in the metal

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,600
work so hard it burned out and never get

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:52,680
to the level of passion or being senior

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:55,770
does that mean dose of knowledge too so

00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:01,920
there are many elements in the tech

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:05,070
industry this is typically need to

00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,490
replace a potential stressors compressed

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,110
deadlines and bishops whole set a

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,270
certain stages won't last longer than

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,920
anticipated so your trust is delayed

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,130
because in your plans now share

00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,990
for some things and the assets are

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:22,560
feedback mark given those expectations

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,180
still stay in place and mission school

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,740
settings that work towards eating rules

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,750
are outside of your comfort zone

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,600
whether that skills really returned

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,040
believe it the constant work is

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,650
something that it because I'm across the

00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:38,190
board whether you're a designer

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,860
developer when you're personally

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,060
invested in your work

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,730
overview doesn't have to be a bad thing

00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,620
and however he was handled and having

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,840
that constant scrutiny it's really

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,080
important to have an evolution way how

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,570
that relates your excommunication

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,160
especially for freelancer remote workers

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,050
and frequent feedback can really

00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,460
translate to self-doubt as well

00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,370
so if you're not if you're gonna be

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,950
drama little vortex you can get it

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,240
realized or they'll have asked about the

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,440
current state of things because you

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:30,510
don't have that present back also

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:33,150
because technology and this my team

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,520
weren't answers as well because we're

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,770
wrong inconstant leaves and if you're in

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,680
a drought we might feel the pressure

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:43,440
quickly these are slow so we can still

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:48,810
respond and I get that helpful that into

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:52,310
it got respond this is some folks not

00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:55,310
ever said I probably understand all the

00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,310
losses

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:03,270
and I think that the pressure - were

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:07,020
having a so constantly changing and it's

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:09,600
important to keep up but it's also a

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,790
tribute from a fireman's you really have

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,370
to get a shoe that's really it's a

00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:17,610
really interesting inspiring otherwise

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:22,970
you'll get overwhelmed and I think he

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,970
could she just she won't she's anything

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:32,220
so what is her name

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:34,380
I am the opinion that burn out of us

00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,070
everyone you've all heard the term

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,200
burnout practice I'm of the opinion that

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,410
we're now as the term that's

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,990
masquerading as terms for larger mental

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,590
health issues but we it's easier favor

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:53,220
it's just even though in Hoffman

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:55,200
depression anxiety and stress is usually

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,670
so it can't be attributed to just

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,260
working confidence it can be a

00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,550
combination of many different things I

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,540
kind of doesn't ask I mean it's a

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:05,640
technical thing it's more like employees

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,530
aren't in situations where they expect

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,540
too much of themselves they never feel

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,540
the work that they're doing is good

00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:15,240
enough it's an advocacy matter even

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,730
having unreasonable demands based upon

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,970
them and Cardinals that just aren't a

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:23,520
big thing diminished ability to take

00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:26,730
pleasure in activities difficulty

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,700
absorbing new information for executive

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,560
function and that's worsening short-term

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,780
memory and also the lower building they

00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:37,980
handle stress and issues that you might

00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:40,650
calmly win with Asia this endless can

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,680
connect with physical manifestations so

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:49,020
the tea headaches irritability reduced

00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:53,070
efficiency and then so burns were

00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:55,530
acceptable in sometimes and then one of

00:23:53,070 --> 00:24:00,000
the things with the tech industry is

00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:01,160
that hard work getting passion is

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,280
overemphasize

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:07,520
I'm really passionate about that I love

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:12,590
it but I also like to be the other

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:15,350
things and I still care about code and

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:20,360
I'm still super passionate but I do like

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:23,270
to the stigma is taking time to recharge

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:28,310
on vacation to take those healthy braids

00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:31,250
to go set up those people stop stand

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,940
right there and so more and more intact

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:40,280
than themselves

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:44,660
ordering courage the slippery slope okay

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:47,930
so some interesting studies about what

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,790
makes a good team and these were their

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,150
five keys to successful

00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:56,810
I love well thank you an ability

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:58,550
structure in here even though most of

00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,100
those are sort of self-explanatory

00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:04,030
in Psychological CTS lab that we'll get

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,030
into a ventilator

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:18,910
these are pretty good social support the

00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,910
jog control

00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,670
good job resources participation

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:34,790
sobriety and makes you have autonomy

00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:38,690
over this decision so the reason keeping

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:40,130
up and done Ballmer out the strata tax

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,230
maybe can implement to those

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,300
experiencing I'm going mental health

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,430
issues also support those who are

00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:53,030
experiencing for an hour or on the

00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:55,900
murderer and those off so here's

00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,900
strategies

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:06,060
so it's important for site level of

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:08,310
safety you want to be cleared their

00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:11,370
areas that still require explanation and

00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:13,260
then h2 numbers and matters you want to

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,090
create things up is so puzzle this is

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,050
something problem are eating problem

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:21,000
that's just a combination of

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,190
psychological see to get accountability

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,890
is vital routines to achieve their full

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,050
potential management coordinate mark

00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,350
like my favorite theatres in all my jobs

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:33,780
have done the modeling curiosity they

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:38,060
asked some questions as well as in

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,060
Hollister there's nothing I love more

00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,239
[Music]

00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:15,300
and improve the model your self-care

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,220
strategies I think that's the most

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:21,960
important especially that's probably the

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:24,630
top they're even produce others you need

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:29,270
to sustain your soft first we're going

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:32,220
to be comfortable the same cuts also big

00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:36,930
this is don't run very it off to LDR

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:40,140
just like and she's just a baby

00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:42,060
stop it more effectively prioritize your

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,140
strength energy the way that catalyze

00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:48,060
your numbers so to put someone to the

00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,460
maximum that I like to tell them and

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:54,950
conserve my energy in other ways and

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,950
then I'm most efficient in the way I do

00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:08,169
some strategies of something ideas are

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:14,380
freelancers I set aside a chunk of time

00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:15,940
it's usually on Friday where I says I

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:22,990
might get a little thing that interests

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:27,100
me that I - it's good for Soviet because

00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:30,399
otherwise I don't have the tenacity to

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:32,440
an hour hours sustainable as a person

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,120
and still maintain my work so I wasn't

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,549
integrating it and part of my work day

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,580
and I feel like not only am i respecting

00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:41,799
those batteries for myself but teaching

00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:44,049
it as work to myself then I also take

00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,149
her seriously versus that like puttering

00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:51,070
clerk training office we made our

00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:53,049
working environments co-working space

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,330
maybe that coffee shop is really

00:28:53,049 --> 00:29:01,240
important also not the recent

00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:07,140
interaction like keep up regular social

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:07,140
engagements but I heard my god civilians

00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:39,669
padishah choose one stick to it I don't

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:41,919
even know all this see a professional

00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:47,110
supporters if you can have a little nice

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:49,149
little pot of it once you're in that

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,980
context you just want to reach out to

00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,100
someone and feel like I need help with

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:58,450
this issue or like

00:29:53,100 --> 00:30:04,120
- anguish and a goodbye letter to remote

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:06,070
receiver sees the devil so that the open

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:10,080
community it's difficult to know what's

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,080
not going on so you need seven days

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:19,090
seven days remedies unless there's our

00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:21,250
training sessions so the expectations of

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,210
people keeping up to pace with the

00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:27,160
industry and art place outside of ours

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,000
three more rooms and we must post words

00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,790
from projects

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,670
three more nuns being like the project

00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,350
management stage where you talk about

00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,390
potential settlement books think that

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,460
they're pretty about things that you

00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,470
want to come over ahead of time that

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,640
concern you and those horns were just

00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,240
like what it sounds fault

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,580
you actually to create of your see space

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,380
epic overviews celebrating on feature

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,970
work so it's not something that

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:57,910
necessarily would be like this feature

00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:03,100
just celebrating everybody's work even

00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:04,810
if it was created a lot imagine it's

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,780
probably the most important thing and

00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:13,120
that's modeling behaviors so imagine

00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:15,010
taking mental health it would be also

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:20,040
something else is like for the future

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:20,040
and so your company and maybe do that

00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,840
research versity channeling they're

00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,540
talking about being reduced amount of

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,320
education torture it's important as mrs.

00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:44,320
C Kailash and some of these strategies

00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,660
will stay nice things in fermentable for

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,380
reaching out for help and they're making

00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:53,229
such range of different takes them home

00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,999
so it doesn't work need support you

00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:58,489
and in holding life

00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:01,429
none of us really want aircrafts or

00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:03,259
health foods are mainly by pitting

00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:06,169
sneezes where info being for people to

00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:08,689
be normal and approachable for health

00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:10,159
and ask for those supports we commit

00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:14,059
we're about strengthening the supports

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,039
that are provided so about your

00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,139
organization local sourcing as well as

00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,019
making some great resources via forums

00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:23,569
and most these three bullets that are

00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,809
geared towards employees and where's and

00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:29,299
then your HR professionals in there

00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:31,729
don't wait you can W for Mike but they

00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:35,089
are really helpful as far as potential

00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:38,329
guidelines and I know that imagine to

00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:42,519
feel nervous about generally helpful

00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:42,519
because they are don't know where P

00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:53,629
activates what are you're doing

00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:55,699
something off or symptoms of a larger

00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:58,279
issue it's important to take some time

00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:59,949
to look into it or you deserve to be

00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:10,059
happy

00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:12,439
because they're not just resources and

00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:15,139
you're in need of further research on

00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:30,559
site all sounds like the amounts of

00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:33,409
academic resources or also as an

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,099
introvert is really like I also say any

00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:36,049
questions

00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:38,359
I'm never the person that asks questions

00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:40,219
at the end of talking but I won't be

00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:42,439
around after this event if you have to

00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:45,549
practice another question or things

00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,549
quite totally anonymous

00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:21,559
and this slash and specifically for

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,480
progressive mental health and it is a

00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:47,450
minute slow right now but I think it's

00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:54,639
because kind of a small people you just

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:54,639
read plenty more or less explain that

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:13,700
Rockstar developers yes thanks the time

00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:15,859
I think a lot of things I think a lot of

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,730
things again it's less like a lot of

00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:23,410
things slide in exchange for that

00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,940
Rockstar developer by unfortunately I

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,579
don't really know the solution to it

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:32,480
other just like this that it's not worth

00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:34,849
it because I I feel like der kinder

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,549
people with the same skill set I just

00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:40,250
don't think that they are as loud as

00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:42,470
goes under people so I don't think tax

00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,079
like the pipeline that comes forth yeah

00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:48,650
there's some people feel awful

00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,000
yeah and I think something that I've

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,040
heard suggested

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,680
a few of my friends workplaces have

00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,530
started to create images workshops and

00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,970
nonviolent communication and also

00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:02,119
because like not only doesn't allow

00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:04,400
those people to potentially learn to

00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,820
communicate differently it also really

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,099
highlighted individuals are struggling

00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:12,830
with communicating certain numbers in a

00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:14,960
certain way to management as well as

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:18,680
their co-workers and people aren't able

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,650
to follow the exercises in those those

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,530
patterns in kind has brought us all like

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,780
a sense of awareness to those situations

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:36,280
where they're like oh that's just done

00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:40,450
so being sound so our real names if

00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,830
that's just so Soviets of them so it's

00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,359
still not tolerable because if they're

00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,099
not repeating their their two numbers

00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:47,810
with the respect they deserve

00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:51,560
it's not pretty much psychological

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:53,780
safety at all and if you feel that's any

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,440
suggestion in which the tables can be

00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,020
critiqued

00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,210
I wasn't even print of a national

00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,760
problem to the forefront if you know

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,210
that you're immediately vivid so nice I

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:13,220
don't fear me you're gonna be

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:20,869
potentially think it also is indicative

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:26,599
of us to as employees sitting around

00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:29,210
places like that too long versus not

00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:31,430
dealing with this I should look for

00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,619
something else yeah I think I know I

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:44,869
personally have said walking which is

00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:46,339
like that where and there's this

00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:48,859
difference as well between because you

00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:50,630
stick around I think perhaps perhaps you

00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:52,369
like voiced concerns and you wanna see

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,500
change so that you have that like a

00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:58,140
little bit what can we

00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:05,640
my actual habits but then I also go to

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:06,960
the situation for you but when change is

00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,240
an actually instigated of that I'm a

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,300
 still singing around because it's

00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,760
just no maybe just half of it it's it's

00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:26,400
more meaningful see the potential for

00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:28,470
change we must do this there's so much

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,210
that has to come from I believe like the

00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,220
management model to the petition called

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,910
down unfortunately like whether it's

00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:40,500
Monte behaviors or the tolerance level

00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:44,360
of certain types of communication I'm

00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:49,730
gonna lay them understand the owner

00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,730
having to work for your policy so cruel

00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:13,710
because the fact that they with hot

00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:16,260
stuff I are sometimes like to kiss to

00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:22,140
them they're smelling their summer but

00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:59,240
to have that somehow no it's not

00:39:22,140 --> 00:40:02,340
overpowered by those other as far as

00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,040
more mental yeah I would totally

00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:08,880
recommend open source

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,650
handouts for that it's a good kind of I

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,840
was a like a non-computational

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,360
way of just being like hey here least

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,070
here are these things and it doesn't it

00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,110
doesn't become a personal issue so much

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:22,600
like these are some things and all the

00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:38,770
mind with like the nation standards of

00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:42,190
like beautiful combination I might have

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:44,230
to be good because if there's nerves

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:47,860
around only the conversation from the

00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:49,630
beginning it's really great to present

00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,870
it just from the standpoint of like hey

00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:55,570
I was the company as a whole rather than

00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:58,030
making more of an individual like twenty

00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:01,570
fingers or whatever just feels part

00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:04,860
state and they don't feel also the ear

00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,860
