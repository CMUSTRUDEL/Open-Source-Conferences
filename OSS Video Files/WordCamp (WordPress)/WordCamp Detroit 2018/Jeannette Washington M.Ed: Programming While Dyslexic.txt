Title: Jeannette Washington M.Ed: Programming While Dyslexic
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	One size doesnâ€™t fit all! This hands-on discussion will address common misconceptions associated with programming while dyslexic. The surface will be scratched in distinguishing the varying features of dyslexia by providing a virtual experience. Additionally, strengths of dyslexic programmers will be exploited. Further, learn how you can be empowered to create Assistive Technologies (i.e., voice recognition, spell checking, data storage and visual modeling) that meet you wherever you are.

luckily law to work after struggling

00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:41,100
right now so so before we insert now

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,950
it's sort of housekeeping that you guys

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,810
know about ways to get social of us to

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,180
remount the conference and they just

00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,870
feel of the journey with us is these

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,900
business different talks and hang out

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,910
because you know there's a party nothing

00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:02,579
like that Nathan follow us on Twitter at

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,240
workout Detroit and then the hash tag

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,829
will be using his WC d DT so if you do

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,740
something that resonates

00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:15,319
you can find me under the Arctic and my

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,159
company is partners are seeking

00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:45,420
articulating apologize so that's how you

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:48,679
can be in touch with me and I will do it

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,439
into his few minutes so you walk in the

00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:54,990
early age my thinking and understand a

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,770
little bit more of one of the slides or

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,169
topics that cover all right so I hold

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,079
them forward

00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:07,169
there it is an Activia I love you guys

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,280
to do these so them to mystify some of

00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:13,130
the perceptions about dyslexia

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,510
on your phone flap your laptop's and

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,510
we'll get started

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,210
[Music]

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,199

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,749
[Music]

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:33,810
[Music]

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,440

[Applause]

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,309
[Music]

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,720
[Music]

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,680
so not awesome

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,800
actually the Caribbean city use those

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,169
paddles of that it is not lack of early

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,389
reading it is a difference in the way

00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,240
that you have received from the cold

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,430
letters and worthless essentially so

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,090
it's not what about my other dad it

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,919
reads that you must childhood that you

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,770
were able to participate in any of the

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:15,810
reading activities that can occur until

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:19,000
a difference in the way that you reading

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:26,139
so looks like the whole cookies one went

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,710
over to Louise was that answer there is

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,710
one

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,740
[Music]

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,000
[Applause]

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:56,510
alright so the entropy is affected only

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,960
four people got that right this is wrong

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,540
Peter well there is not one text deck in

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,470
diagnosis limit there is a multitude

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:09,200
attached it is about five she can test

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,770
so that you can recognize an

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,650
individual's IQ then do a language tests

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,340
and boring reading in writing test as

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,340
well as

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,629
[Applause]

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:58,450
see letters into Kirkuk swap letters

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,910
both in the second year of a private

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,690
instruction you can tell those who

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:07,890
deviate or need further assistance

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:12,810
usually catch alive you know children

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:14,920
learn to play and once they become

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,779
accommodated student the rigors of

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,670
school and any learned how to wear a

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:23,890
Canon gravity or dance like that tick to

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,709
reverse left them to be is a deep or

00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,230
side of the what however after two years

00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:35,589
of instruction if they are so exhibiting

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:39,100
the host issues that dyslexia reverse

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:46,870
the entire world into learning words

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:49,110
yeah I am on a row movement on social

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,110
economic status it's back to consume

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,110
dislikes

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,329
[Music]

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:20,660
it's true that they're true however it

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,930
is false so socioeconomic status which

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,720
is whether you come from a poor

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,940
upbringing or wealthier everything has

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,040
nothing to do whether we will be

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,010
diagnosed or whether you will dance it

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,450
is Lexie however the dividing factor

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:41,140
within X so remind me of that usually

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,210
wealthier families are able to afford

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:48,290
remediation for their children they can

00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:50,300
afford to the private tutors and people

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,400
who are sealed and teaching individuals

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,960
how to be how to write

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:59,840
however those or socio-economic families

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:04,180
they generally walk and you look through

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,180
cracks what he did for the Atlantic I

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:35,840
want to using the some statements that

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:39,710
are really wrong and so forth you got

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,710
this right and it is false so Klingons

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:47,210
and animals and female in the dyslexia

00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:51,530
the spectrum metals are more verbal are

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:54,440
more they exhibit behavior problems or

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,300
issues that are more transparent so that

00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,550
how they are able to be identified

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:04,630
quicker did what he knows we tenses and

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:07,130
spectra quotes of suffering silence so

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,410
we're going to read that we're

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,559
struggling with the letters of our

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,410
about those if you're playing so

00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,079
educators the people who are our Vincent

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,669
assistants they're not able to identify

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:38,869
all she's trouble

00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:56,809
so again it affects water and cure

00:14:38,869 --> 00:14:58,369
dyslexia and your isn't it is far by the

00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:00,199
edge to all that you go back to this

00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:03,379
market see how many you are and the

00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:08,839
right here wrong you still on the oil

00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:13,459
industry right here so real order will

00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:16,129
cure if you do not understand how the

00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:20,149
code works with competitors conflicting

00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:24,049
sounds really normally causing more

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:27,529
stress so it's not going to magically

00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:29,629
help you overcome this particular of

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:33,199
health we're going to keep reading and

00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:36,129
again suffering in silence so it's not

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:40,669
really that can create dyslexia

00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:58,220
alright dyslexia rooms and families it

00:15:40,669 --> 00:16:01,009
isn't here that's nature it is in your

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,109
own biological element it's not

00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,269
considered a disease really just a

00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:07,669
difference in the way that you read it's

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:10,699
your parents either your mom or your dad

00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:12,889
happens to have dyslexia then it is

00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:15,709
likely that you will have as well so

00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,869
please be mindful that when your parents

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,289
were growing up just let's do one other

00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:19,940
thing

00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:22,700
so they

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,580
you know that they have it maybe the

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,820
thing didn't like to read or they didn't

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:32,500
like school things like that to play the

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:36,740
part but bobbinet or on board it

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:45,080
penny she's reading or hex dyslexia that

00:16:36,740 --> 00:17:06,190
it's likely to lexi is the robot

00:16:45,080 --> 00:17:06,190
disorder in for a doctor it if you are

00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:17,060
corrected or someone who's 32 important

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,760
wheeling an instruction and assessment

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,700
works so it's not something done at a

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,330
hospital or clinic first we look at the

00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:29,450
gym is research on this like Freddie

00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:31,700
opposed to a lexapro

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,100
so those are the only things that no the

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:38,030
doctors really involve themselves in a

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,040
formative research the MRIs cerebral

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,630
cerebral blood patterns and

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,540
understanding the brand of how it

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,970
relates to they won't be able to

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:50,800
diagnose because it really comes from an

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:57,050
education or an educational standpoint

00:17:50,800 --> 00:18:09,980
all right a PhD in sweats here

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:13,970
Connelly so we have so the answer to

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:16,120
this is is actually true because sixty

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:20,060
percent of individuals who experience

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,100
dyslexia also have attention deficit our

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:31,730
exit

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:56,560
so it's very common infection Apple only

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:59,360
English speakers it's not a language

00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,780
dyslexia doesn't have a manager so you

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,760
can't even speak fluent German and also

00:19:02,780 --> 00:21:38,960
be dyslexic you German

00:19:04,760 --> 00:21:42,800
however we shall see how five euro is

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,040
quite first we use money to make the

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:50,450
game work how is supposed to work with

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:54,050
coding as you know it's all about

00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:57,340
patience is the key so I mean that's

00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:02,050
really all about me I love rich shopping

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,050
have osteo my college car

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:23,540
/ - hurry in so I'm going to show you

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,670
that manipulation pretty closely about

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:30,570
dyslexia this picture you see up here is

00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:34,470
like a man created it so that you can

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:36,809
understand how you can create a distinct

00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:40,550
way of identifying letters because if

00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:48,059
you let dyslexia it's very difficult for

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:50,730
individuals to decode works so this

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,920
makes it Malaysian I'll make it large

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,340
do you guys can see it that'd be mild

00:22:52,920 --> 00:23:00,330
that obviously dyslexia comes in two

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:03,059
different forms and this is not by the

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,950
means being I'll tell but I really

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:10,610
thought this is not interesting someone

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:15,870
please get up pages to create what that

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:19,470
looks like so as you see there letters

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:23,460
from around the page everything looks

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:26,370
like and it's sort of that is what

00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:31,140
allows you to try to three with the

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:42,990
first line of friends who has dyslexia

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:44,640
to describe to me how she agreed that

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:54,270
takes a lot of concentration

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:58,190
concentration and experience however

00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:02,309
this to me is an extreme form it's not

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:05,760
without pursuing dyslexia is like well

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:08,260
it's very interesting to see you know we

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,660
certainly take it for granted

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,340
because I was not hyphenated to read

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:19,270
that very first passage is a little

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:22,140
confusing I know the love they have

00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:26,860
created in some really unique and

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:30,130
unparalleled dinner box that this one is

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:35,530
for this lesson so company in the UK and

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:38,580
what they use generally are some bonds

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:42,750
that have heavy violence and unique

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:46,059
openings so that you won't get the terms

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,760
confusing that he will see that some of

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:50,559
the letters are City wears other stuff

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,500
which are made a little bit here because

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,660
you may not be able to see it but no

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,600
this is pretty awesome like the PD have

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:02,500
a larger bottle in the LOC every

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,090
thousand views with any other buyers so

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,490
yeah there's a couple different products

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:09,070
that exist but this one is very popular

00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,549
in Vitek and I've actually used it

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,260
before working with students and to my

00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:17,410
understanding they were really able to

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,890
see the letters and they didn't mirror

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:26,980
one another because they were off their

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:29,350
dependency and I have we are hello good

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:33,790
I want to try to fly through the next

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:37,360
couple slides writing so this is a brand

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:40,360
image of Alexa creature and a dyslexic

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,150
reader and as you will see of their

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,100
obviously some differences and that's

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:49,059
why I said neurological for new

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:52,750
neurobiological element because as you

00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:54,970
see the left Alexa brain has a lot of

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,580
activity going on on the left hemisphere

00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,150
and if you look down at someone who

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,000
passed

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:03,179
Lexia look at that brain pattern you

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,179
don't

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,250
so the brand dominance period is

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,769
definitely evolving around this Lexia

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,899
because empires in sit ladies a hearing

00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:17,019
this well maybe it's something with by

00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:19,029
side but then dexamethasone doctor seats

00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:21,429
together do some research and they said

00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:23,559
a while there are some differences with

00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:28,289
the blood flow with activity of the

00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:28,289
strength of those two hemispheres as you

00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:40,409
Steven wants to mark neck exiting and I

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,899
want to distress PowerPoint it is that

00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:48,809
futanari that dyslexia is different off

00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:52,740
the board and so I will rest some

00:26:48,809 --> 00:27:40,090
Rubik's cubes because these some lies

00:26:52,740 --> 00:27:44,460
the difference with the hold it and try

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:47,289
to figure out how to get it back to

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,840
exactly where it was because we know we

00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:55,889
have six covers twenty-one pieces and

00:27:49,840 --> 00:28:04,659
fifty for our services take a look

00:27:55,889 --> 00:28:07,470
didn't want for these excuse me a little

00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:07,470
bit more colors

00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:20,300
it can be very puzzling and in this

00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:28,510
colorful spectrum that has Rosie of the

00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:28,510
roots cute puzzle you guys have mastered

00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:57,950
how technology in mankind can really

00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,310
partner with one another to create some

00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:04,400
really unique tax okay so when it comes

00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:07,490
to dyslexia and you are a coder whether

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,080
you are too excited move back in

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,720
it was a very important that you have

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,600
some different hats and some differently

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,420
accommodators so we are at whatever

00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:22,490
going to work both of you have to have a

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:25,460
way to leverage the play so we have

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:28,280
popular readers somebody the readers can

00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:31,640
be really helpful like I'm dragging does

00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,890
it dragon speech and what it will do

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,020
obviously as you guys know help read

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,180
some of the wording for you and you have

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,400
a natural reader I'm going to sprinkle

00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:44,240
in these like great for those who

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,820
experience HDS but having something to

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,970
kind of vision with while you're you're

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,680
kind of eating your mind right for your

00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:54,350
your assignment and whatever you're

00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,570
doing at work pretty awesome so you also

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:59,120
when you move into the next full of

00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,060
Internet filters I know I have a very

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,490
difficult time staying on task so

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,000
Internet filters providing the

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,660
opportunity to be unable to those

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,610
internal websites I mean sometimes I

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,610
create a code for something for work and

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,779
because they become like the the

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,549
interwebs everything is happening I've

00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:30,980
even talked to people who like

00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:33,080
disconnected or Wi-Fi driver while

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,870
they're working on something specific so

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,000
that they can stay focus if engaged and

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:42,110
then finally you want to be practicing

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,179
your syntax because of with being

00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:46,490
dyslexic

00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:48,049
you just need opportunity to practice

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,240
practice practice

00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:53,120
so that when you come to the table with

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,240
your counterparts for typical developers

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,830
or they may not experience on

00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,190
exceptionalities like you you want to be

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:03,919
able to bring up unique to new people of

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:08,059
their level so that's why it's important

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:12,500
to use coming back or hold academy and

00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:14,960
those types of platforms to help you to

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,039
learn or suspend resources and technical

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,860
skills who concepts can be true I have a

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,200
friend with dyslexia who often sketches

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,000
out this color beforehand ago they need

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,399
to do it and some internet books it's

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,770
not a big body I'm gonna be canine and

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,380
verified just in case you guys aren't

00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:37,779
really interested in looking at ways to

00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,779
walk out what's going on in the Internet

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:48,200
[Applause]

00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:52,970
talk about some of our our join the

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:55,760
rights of those who have a sister who

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,390
plays figures she was also with the help

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,299
you always remember the chin high from

00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:05,480
though that wasn't sled here we have Tim

00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:08,899
Tebow interest retired from the NFL now

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:12,860
he's playing baseball major league so he

00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:13,450
has Will Smith medium rapper and I love

00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,940
it

00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:19,320
actors Jennifer Aniston America's

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:23,260
Sweetheart of course Steve Jobs would be

00:32:19,320 --> 00:33:28,419
someone with a different ability and

00:32:23,260 --> 00:33:36,039
enough thinking and dyslexia consider so

00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:43,139
your work has not one is the same the

00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:45,450
Winkler so to support the work they have

00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:50,350
let's see I would say to use

00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:52,929
multi-sensory to provide pictures for

00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:57,190
instructions to make sure that the font

00:33:52,929 --> 00:34:03,000
is enlarged and using different colors

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:03,000
and all these may be using audio because

00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:14,159
I can't incorporate taste but touching

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,050
so hungry different ways

00:34:26,269 --> 00:35:14,190
so so there's two there's a moderate so

00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:17,249
as it relates to programmers who have

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:20,490
been identified as having dyslexia I was

00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:23,819
not complete different hats like I

00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:26,989
suggested as far as from audio because

00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:30,660
maybe seen it the emphases jump around

00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:33,660
input contribution in for wasting time

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,249
so maybe need to hear the instructions

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,880
what your sponsee doing

00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:41,849
maybe to spit extra time on those I'm

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,019
holding it back so that you can beat

00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:49,130
your syntax even though that solitude is

00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:55,220
very effective having one voice

00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,220
headphones is finally what we're screen

00:35:55,819 --> 00:36:04,700
you have to go to trial here but once

00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:04,700
you identify a way that you work better

00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:21,140
[Music]

00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:21,140
but in farm life

00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:08,260
the entire department is not using

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:12,690
fluorescence we use side lighting

00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:17,490
lighting combination worm and some

00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,490
plants so we

00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,689
[Music]

00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:48,169
[Music]

00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,460
[Music]

00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,129
[Music]

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:43,550
- teacher can request 30 population

00:41:44,630 --> 00:42:00,200
obviously more information on

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,879
[Applause]

00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,499
[Applause]

00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:31,270
all right questions I will make this

00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:39,250
available actually created so you want

00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:42,420
to work okay make small speakers will do

00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,420
blog post afterwards

00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:39,610
