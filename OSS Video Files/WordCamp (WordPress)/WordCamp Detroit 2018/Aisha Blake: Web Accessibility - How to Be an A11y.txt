Title: Aisha Blake: Web Accessibility - How to Be an A11y
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	Your content is clear, your images are responsive, your code is clean, and your layout flows beautifully on all the most popular devices. You think you’re ready to launch, but you might have overlooked a crucial aspect of your website’s development. If it’s not easy for a person to access your content regardless of the way in which they use the internet, there’s still work to be done. Developing for accessibility should be part of the standard workflow, but it’s often given very little attention. This session will cover some of the low-hanging fruit that you can start picking today and take a deep dive into a few tools to help you build accessibility into your projects from the beginning.

Oh

00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:13,209
so this what actually got me into Billy

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:21,160
is a picture of my friends on the New

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:24,280
York recently here below support

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,090
provided vision impaired athletes I was

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,830
in undergrad I watched virtual enters a

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,390
little nursery and I found myself

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:38,730
interacting with the same two people of

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,930
the day which is just ridiculous but

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,250
there are so many things that could be

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,930
experiencing right now

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,920
I need to get out there and excuse me

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:52,959
and so I instead of studying for finals

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,000
my first semester in college I Wow and

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,400
I'm joined here heritage is alleged

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,050
volunteer organization of the city this

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,660
was this was where I landed this was

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:09,610
things that had caught me catch me

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:11,950
years just gave me a very special took

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,860
the more initiative because that wasn't

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,860
actually one of the largest old Walter

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:29,100
so many people and getting to some

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:33,280
friends with a lot of my views I'm

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:37,560
really interested in how I could make it

00:03:33,280 --> 00:05:37,950
up and then from there

00:03:37,560 --> 00:05:42,960
so yes so excessively cousin everyone

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,960
how so

00:05:44,159 --> 00:08:26,889
or whether there is something that is

00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:30,839
putting on something that is making and

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:33,579
so having access to all of those people

00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:38,979
making so that they can use your pot

00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:41,620
easily same way that you write it means

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:44,370
that you have more users which is almost

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,370
always a good thing

00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:01,360
HoJ in the means risky path earlier used

00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:10,540
these a little bathroom stall I do have

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:32,639
a bigger bathroom so really so the most

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:35,649
desirable and so meeting our apps is

00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:41,500
making our masks for people with

00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:43,629
disabilities just makes them pack I your

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,640
point light it is the World Wide Web

00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:49,130
but it is that

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,060
information and we want to be able to

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,060
share that information

00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:59,420
cool so look I am if you're in humorous

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,230
we can only touch on this but I want to

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,620
start to dive into standards that we

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:10,720
have that all of this is really based on

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:13,580
there are other their own standards that

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,850
you may want to be in some cases

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,820
depending on the industry and especially

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,190
if you are keen on being there are

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:25,730
traditional guidelines that we can talk

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:29,840
about if that comes up we're gonna start

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,790
with this catchy winner that is the web

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,640
content accessibility guidelines I was

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:38,840
Eric and I remember when content

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,240
accessibility is to beta soon be is our

00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:46,250
set of guidelines that are for companies

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,580
you for Nicole's your sites or actually

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:52,550
perceivable operable understandable and

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:57,860
robust those are further broken down

00:10:52,550 --> 00:11:02,690
into guidelines so that my minds are

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:06,080
clear you are seeing the more services

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:09,350
more measurable goals and we'll take you

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,630
through checklists in just a moment to

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,100
either by clients are going to be okay

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,980
you need a beauty - how much pretty

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,520
intense what's a seven and then every

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,650
job

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,900
we're break back into success criteria

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,240
so you know that we need alternative

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:28,070
text for non-text package what's that

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,270
mean and how would we test it so we're

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:55,480
actually gonna

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:57,160
over here I only just look at so water

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:08,110
affects living we're going to talk about

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:11,770
looks so you're already that is the

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,839
vision of largely being at that meeting

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,060
that success criteria will have the

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,279
accessibility of your map

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,410
people tend to think of these as being

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:26,230
exactly funny which is not skates level

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:31,450
or necessarily would you have a level

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:38,790
triple a success criteria related to

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:38,790
energy in their head so what we're doing

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:51,370
if there are thermal effects you can

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:54,339
that's are relevant to you halfway and

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:59,080
reading these not a mouthful be you know

00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:06,730
the goal should be seeing those you're

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:09,280
playing experience ain't comin striving

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,850
to it's trying to connectivity why I

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,410
don't

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:22,650
I forgot with as many times around

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:22,650
it's my that spins my life yeah

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:43,779
beautiful a restaurant screaming there

00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:47,350
we go so this reference is essentially

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:49,380
what I use to help people to feel a

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,089
little more comfortable for the island

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,480
if you just try to read them all at once

00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:59,110
then you get over love this too much

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,440
it's very very specific very gentle and

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:06,250
dry it's just I

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,459
I admit I literally run horse continent

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,580
and then I have to dig it in Shutts was

00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:16,000
it too much but this tool is really cool

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:19,120
because it less user interacts with the

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,980
guideline only to even start relevant to

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:28,270
you so if you're a teen then you say

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:32,320
okay leave this content and you can

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:35,410
usually still turtle around you might

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,920
say I only wants to see the lines that

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,740
are relevant to the designers I'm going

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:46,890
to see ones and relatives who developers

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:49,810
and so you can build it and then this

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,310
section on the right that is only an

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:55,600
item that you need to worry about in

00:14:51,310 --> 00:15:00,339
that moment I can share this on your

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:07,140
team which makes it really need to stay

00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:12,490
aligned so let's break this down okay

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:16,560
the first two the first the first

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,560
principle is perceivable your app

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,020
provides alternatives ready non-text

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,570
content so you change into other forms

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,080
that people need large print Braille

00:15:31,570 --> 00:16:33,760
speech symbols for simpler

00:15:34,080 --> 00:16:39,820
so is like the low-hanging fruit that

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:45,280
single a sentence an Israeli has a text

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:48,130
alternative now note this is exactly the

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,050
situation though the number of these are

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,780
going to have exceptions there are going

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:57,090
to be cases where it makes sense for you

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:59,820
to provide a text for example if I have

00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:02,470
an image that is purely decorative

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,959
there isn't I don't need to say that

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:10,420
there is like a flower these really

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,760
think in the order of I personally

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:19,570
probably gonna do in the first place and

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:21,349
I'm told it which to pay attention to a

00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,260
lot of those exceptions where they meet

00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:28,939
[Music]

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,939
any questions so far

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,059
just curious

00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:41,460
so this will bring it not be this

00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,940
particular like it's not all permission

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:52,740
at once you can say okay I know that one

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:56,000
I couldn't do this the examples are make

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,620
it and also then shoots at each

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,330
billiards or that's the civic success

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:10,620
criteria political life examples and

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:18,809
situation struggle in a safe situation

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:20,460
be it strip scription and all serve the

00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:23,610
same purpose and some of the same

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:28,470
information as anonymous them so this is

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:36,960
a chart for anagrams this is how we go

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:39,409
about providing manageable option this

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,409
is what

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,569
[Music]

00:18:47,840 --> 00:19:30,350
I'm okay

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm very oddly

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,440
so I write is from the perspective of it

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:47,260
like if you have questions please not be

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,160
passive into not get sake I know a thing

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:54,980
will you

00:19:49,160 --> 00:20:05,590
oh this so yes you can also use reader

00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:05,590
and I I'm neurotic and you just pull up

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:25,040
so this is just so if you just don't

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,460
like if any of you won't work beyond I

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,610
[Music]

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:36,020
see it not specimen if you haven't met

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:38,480
stools you know so I was always kind of

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:44,330
interesting so maybe it is supported in

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:51,910
by facts you're you're skipping the leg

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:56,630
no need afraid of those or that beating

00:20:51,910 --> 00:21:01,670
or that is obvious that what we'll tell

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:04,580
it include just yeah no that's not

00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,710
always be peace they're not they're not

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,800
didn't quite work that me a little

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:13,600
double is not necessarily more math and

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,600
I couldn't blame

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,089
[Music]

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:59,279
so these are and this is where my

00:21:46,539 --> 00:22:06,700
questions easy every time and he had a

00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:10,320
really bad this alt attribute and given

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:19,419
description I do not be treacherous

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:21,250
about the extra weight needs to know us

00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,980
it is relevant to your cousins

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,289
nobody needs to know what she looks like

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:30,159
it helped me to know what kind of room

00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:45,629
she's in unless you are describing your

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:45,629
to and by all means gets to do even too

00:22:52,790 --> 00:23:12,330
Asik Republic weekly a short that your

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:14,850
markup higher especially your freezer

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,620
but when you're especially if you really

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,290
try to push the envelope in terms of

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,410
design this is where you want to pay

00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:28,010
attention tendency at least max berries

00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:30,480
is to sort of publish the information

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,780
architecture above your act when you're

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,470
trying to do something a sneaker and

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:41,850
that can really hurt be Sicilian I want

00:23:37,470 --> 00:24:01,559
to make sure that you're using all of

00:23:41,850 --> 00:24:05,309
these Heights that so if you don't it's

00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:09,720
it sounds so simple your production

00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:27,000
application shocking to me how many see

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:30,150
that and not compete of huge make sure

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:37,210

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:45,470
absolutely measurable think through its

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:49,940
truth and right and you're not

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:52,850
it's absolutely you to get back under

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,620

00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,679
person under your chairs to copyright

certainly I'm looking at all states but

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:17,280
I spent any amount of time it's gonna

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:21,600

experience it's going to be a difference

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:33,750
to the experience that I get on that new

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:41,160
place which is also so in this case this

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:45,059

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,700

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:26,570
he's the clickable area and so beyond

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:26,570
itself last so I

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,029
[Applause]

00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,410
[Music]

is a video

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,049
[Music]

00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,749
[Music]

00:31:04,279 --> 00:32:05,100
there are also the use of energy and

00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:21,919
work through your regular basis work

00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:21,919
with your fugitive

00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:40,770
student reading already top colors that

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:43,910
you want returned fool run through here

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:49,020
I can't tell you whether you need

00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:54,900
results in this piece and she's also the

00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:57,510
triple a local art of strips if you're

00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:06,179
just exploring maybe here will be

00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:12,320
something new this color all the options

00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:17,880
will be compliant these are the

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:28,890
competition so there is actually an NPM

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:32,280
module so they're working in Kosrae gets

00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:34,169
your models in development and just keep

00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:40,080
checking and making sure just a wall of

00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:46,559
all your intestines in us we have asked

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:48,390
which is that school and we'll each

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:54,840
other and then checking out a lot of

00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:58,820
their stuff treating certain interested

00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,820
in finding more not only is it

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:18,650
so our critique one thing all of these

00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:41,030
new times back to bill green asking

00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:43,160
about beef after a novel beginning so if

00:34:41,030 --> 00:35:05,330
a vertex is two shoes and third using an

00:34:43,160 --> 00:35:08,960
event I use it as a image background but

00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:10,220
it is it is sort of ago he attended or

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,230
something I'll use it as a background

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,110
image resin is have you hash over there

00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:17,600
that way but it always cover little

00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,270
mistakes evidence whether that's

00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:31,220
thinking specific for the penetration of

00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:34,340
it okay if you must you can so one

00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:37,060
technique is to have extreme eater only

00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,060
absent

00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,020
we'll check with all text first

00:35:53,850 --> 00:36:12,930
- folks oh yes I know so that it's dear

00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:20,130
like you that we return of evening only

seriously that it was just he has she

00:36:33,150 --> 00:37:37,050
I also use plain language that research

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,050
[Music]

00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:06,050
you know in the UK the Pierces

00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,050
disheartening what

00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,950
since you have a hobby

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:30,680
straighten your intuitive are doing

00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:34,410
anything happening conceive an

00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,470
educational institution there these two

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:41,220
they're nationally

00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:43,550
I'm going backwards right away out of

00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,550
eight
