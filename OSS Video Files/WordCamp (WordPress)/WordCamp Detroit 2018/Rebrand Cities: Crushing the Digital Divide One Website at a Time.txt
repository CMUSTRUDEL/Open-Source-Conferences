all right how's everybody doing this

00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:10,050
morning we good good I'm excited to be

00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,550
here we got a full house there anything

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,430
I got to do something good today all

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,990
right okay so so I'm excited but I'm

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,460
here today to talk about something I'm

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,109
extremely passionate about how many

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,669
people the work did they do all right

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:26,310
and I want to talk to you because I

00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:29,189
think lots of time work gets a bad rap

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,310
right because our parents grew up and

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:35,010
they did a job because they had to make

00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,989
money so that we could go to school and

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,489
we could just so they could provide for

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,440
us but I think we have an opportunity to

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,489
be able to do work that matters how many

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,280
people want to work on stuff that

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,140
absolutely matters like what I'm talking

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,390
about today is about really getting you

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,640
to think outside of just creating a

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,500
website or just or just the business

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,629
that you do to really getting in the

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,550
stuff that absolutely matters and makes

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,519
a difference in people's lives right and

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,989
so and so this is what this is all about

00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,010
because like I love what I do I can

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,550
world I want to wear to work

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,840
I can my office is downtown and I have a

00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,910
chance to be able to do that but it

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,800
wasn't always like that because I was

00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,240
told to go to school get a good job I

00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,440
went into mechanical engineering I

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,240
worked at forward and then my job and so

00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,940
and so then I was off being an

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,840
entrepreneur and everyone wants to be an

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,160
entrepreneur until they become one and

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,740
one thing coming out the newer they

00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,390
realize this stuff is really hard and

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,940
they don't just pay you because you look

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,280
good right I made like their art I mean

00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,200
is there any pure entrepreneurs in here

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,870
you understand the ebbs and flows and

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,190
entrepreneurship the people who don't

00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,110
know then you're not appear on turnover

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,030
because you understand you can have

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,760
great clients one day that actually pay

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,560
and I talk about clients when they check

00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,680
or when the when the money is deposited

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,600
in the account right all right okay so

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,570
y'all know on top of our so again so as

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,010
we get started what I want to do is is

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:03,090
if I wanted to share just a little bit

00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,010
about our story okay and kind of kind of

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,540
how I got into the space and it goes

00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,110
back to the documentary that I happened

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,770
to be a part of back in 2011 and what

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,290
happened was is that it really

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,200
without my eyes to the way the world

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,120
really works and how money works and

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,190
people that get opportunity is not

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,360
because they're smarter than you are and

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,340
so I learned this term it's called

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,680
meritocracy I had never heard other term

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,770
in my life but it's worth Mitaka see

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,980
talks about that the smartest people get

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,720
the opportunities but as I look at

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,940
people who were launching textiles what

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,260
I realized is that there was someone who

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,150
getting an opportunity who wore

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,920
flip-flops who didn't even have a pitch

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,010
debt who they the quarter of a million

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,960
dollars and you know in lots of times

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,760
what happens in business is that we just

00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,910
happen to do business with people that

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,860
we are like I think that's a human thing

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,020
and so I don't necessarily think that

00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,400
people have bad intentions but I think

00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,060
that when the power is in ungroup' to

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,060
someone else

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,220
and so as I look at this I'm excited

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,440
about the city Detroit but I'm excited

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,120
because I see a great opportunity and I

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,810
want to see us are we really creating a

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,580
city for all people not just the 2%

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,990
without we creating a city for everybody

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,640
and sort of work that we're going to do

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,230
it really really it really ties into

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,760
this kind of stuff so we started this

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,980
project in yridian started out and was

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,930
called rebrand III and so we had pitched

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,250
this idea to the knight Foundation and

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,780
they had and they had the thing that was

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,910
called the knight city challenge and

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,959
during this night city challenged there

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:37,660
were 7,000 people that apply okay so I

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,340
was like I mean I was like even

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,990
interested in even applying for program

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,410
right I applied for the program we were

00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,090
one of 32 people who chilly one see I

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,220
mean that it was less than 2% I had a

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,950
better chance of actually hitting the

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,530
lottery which I don't play then actually

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,260
winning and we won and we all of a

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,330
sudden had a bag of money and so now if

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,670
you've ever if you ever gotten a grant

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,250
or anything like that and your numbers

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,750
publicized and you start to talk to

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,030
contractor than people then everybody's

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,709
trying to spend all of them there all

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,690
right I mean like I like I got the pole

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,670
just for like almost all the money to do

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,010
one thing I'm like dude there's no way

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,140
I'm gonna pay you this amount to do you

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,940
know and so it began to help me to

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,070
understand that the work that were doing

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,840
we had a year to accomplish this goal of

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,460
trying to take what we saw in Midtown

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,650
and downtown Detroit and bring

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,509
into a neighborhood and once I got into

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,490
gran my roaster what I realized is that

00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:34,090
I wasn't going to be able to accomplish

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,440
the goal in 365 days because of the

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,780
other issue the in terms of

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,460
infrastructure and in just a way that

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,259
the neighborhood was laid out in terms

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,630
of trying to help businesses in those

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,669
communities and so part of our work we

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,009
began to realize is that we were really

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,960
trying to solve the wrong problem right

00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,330
because we were bringing thought-leaders

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,030
into a neighborhood but as a process

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,669
where we realized that a lot of these

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,060
businesses they were they weren't even

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,000
online

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,380
they weren't even visible and so and so

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,509
those were things that we had to kind of

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,910
focus on and so if we began to knock

00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,680
take this idea we went to WordPress and

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,660
we picked aside do we say there's 28

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,440
million small businesses in the United

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,539
States of this we know that like twelve

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:22,080
point eight million businesses have no

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:25,810
website so nine when go online I mean

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,750
not the purchase they literally go

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,250
online and they have a pop but the

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,990
businesses that we're trying to serve in

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,699
communities and neighborhoods are not

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,250
even visible that method is a lost

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,229
opportunity so begin to dig more and get

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,699
it and get and get into the data and

00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:41,590
into the weeds a little bit and we

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:44,710
realize that 46% of businesses have no

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,110
website so there's a huge opportunity to

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,659
be able to address this issue to be able

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,729
to help make businesses visible how many

00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:54,820
people have ever tried to go to a place

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,680
of business and you went into and you

00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,000
went into Google Maps and you didn't

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,949
find them what did you do I went

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,110
somewhere else right so now I didn't

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,570
call oh my what I was out look if it

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,820
says it's closed in Google Maps I'm

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,500
assuming your clothes or if it's

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,590
permanently closed or the hours are

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,150
wrong or if you're not even there and so

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,070
what happened that great businesses are

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,159
not even getting opportunities because

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,810
we're not even visible and so and so he

00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,880
said that's the work that we want to

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,650
focus on and so we began to go down this

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,810
path of being able to work specifically

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,710
on addressing this problem so we talked

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,300
about that already

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,070
and so what happened is that we began to

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,050
go into neighborhoods we started here in

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,180
Detroit but then we started to go into

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,729
neighborhoods all across

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,949
and we began to find different pockets

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,990
of energy of of entrepreneurs that we

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,490
could work with so we were in Newark and

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,650
we we had a chance to work with this

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,800
group about tools called moms who hustle

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,690
so I'd always heard about mompreneurs

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,759
but I had never heard about I've never

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,240
really thought about single mothers who

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,090
were working full-time jobs who were

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,479
full-time parents and who were running

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:05,400
businesses and the hustle and the grit

00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,400
and the drive of these women was like

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,590
was off the chart right and so we had a

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,630
chance to be able to work with this

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,250
specific community of entrepreneurs and

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,470
we began to find that there are other

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,870
entrepreneurs out of this college

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,710
students who are doing amazing work and

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,810
so I want to so I want to I want you to

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,910
listen to one of the Oxford that we had

00:07:24,810 --> 00:08:13,650
a chance to actually talk to her name

00:07:26,910 --> 00:08:18,180
was Mia X I look at the whole video but

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,849
she is a she is a poet and so she the

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,009
mother and so she s 4qg the single

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,419
mother but having the opportunity to be

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,070
able to work with her to be able to get

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,130
her site online so then her business

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,330
it's called it's called imagine life and

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,710
so as we were working with her putting

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,810
together her site we're looking for

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,640
different ways to do it so we said you

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,399
know let's be creative with domain name

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,539
so as the work that you're doing

00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,490
thinking about ways to be able to help

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,979
your clients to become more creative

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,440
when there's a limited budget so we said

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,220
okay I so imagine life has already taken

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,050
but there

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,350
this thing called dot like so why don't

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,389
we give we imagine that life and so it's

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,519
the little things that you can do in

00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,560
terms of working with your clients to

00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,170
get them to think outside so that you

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,720
can help them to reimagine their actual

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,980
their actual business and so and so as a

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,410
part of our process we're taking

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,959
pictures so we can help her to be able

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,870
to grow her business and even the small

00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,879
things of integrating PayPal and ways to

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,050
take payments because she was doing the

00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,180
thing that was called hugging the ball

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,610
and I was like okay explain to me what

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,079
hugging the blocky is explain to me how

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,540
we can turn it into a business model

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,209
that a corporation can understand that

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,199
they can actually fund right and so and

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:30,660
so when we start to work with

00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:32,310
entrepreneurs in neighborhoods it gives

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,589
us an opportunity to be able to do like

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,149
really meaningful work and I'm not

00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,300
against corporations I'm not against

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,889
huge huge businesses but it's nice when

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,329
you have a chance to be able to know the

00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:44,310
people that you work with and you have a

00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:46,740
chance to be able to do something that

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,199
we know is impacting her family it's

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,149
impacting the bottom line and so and so

00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:54,449
if you look at if you look at

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:59,639
entrepreneurship it's my opinion on this

00:09:54,449 --> 00:10:01,559
is a nonlinear process right so every

00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,430
day I literally wake up and figure out

00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:07,050
what am I not going to do today right

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,089
because this is what is like okay I got

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,129
all the stuff to do the way to get it

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,870
done and you can read all the blogs

00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:14,399
online and tell you all the things about

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,439
SEO and all these other kind of thing

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,470
but I can show you people break every

00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:20,879
single rule and stuff works right and so

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,860
at the end of the day you have to figure

00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,720
out you know what is the work that

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,939
you're going to do what were you created

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,920
and purposed to do and then figure out a

00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:30,809
way to be able to get it done the other

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,180
part is that it takes community to get

00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,800
this stuff done so what I realize is

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,170
that I don't I don't it doesn't matter

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,129
how smart I think I am I need people

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,370
that believe in me

00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,959
I need people with the what we're doing

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,699
with rebrand cities the reason that were

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,120
able to do it is because of a man by the

00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:51,600
name of John mitre here's the here's the

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,050
the global head of design for world

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,220
press'll and he believed in our project

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,440
when in time for our own and so for each

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,450
one of you there

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,340
where you become a sponsor or you have a

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,560
chance to be a voice for someone where

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,780
you can literally open up a door that

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,550
can change the accurate objective that

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,310
actual business or that person's life

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,650
and so again entrepreneurship if you are

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,000
unclear and you need a picture I do want

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,500
to make sure if you had a clear graphic

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,540
on what entrepreneurship look like

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,780
because that's what like every single

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,430
day is just is the new adventure so the

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,710
project that we're doing literally if

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,260
we're helping to create brands for $300

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:31,910
so I know sometimes we're making a lot

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,160
of money we're rolling in the dough but

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,620
our goal is how can we help get a

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,650
business online and only charge them

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:44,270
$300 the hosting plan that we're using

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:46,130
through our press is $300 so that means

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,500
that we have some fight funding that

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,600
allows us to have a team together but

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,700
we're going into neighborhoods saying we

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,670
can now help you - we can help build a

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,350
brand for you for $300 and what this

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,140
means is that it includes photography

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,090
and includes website design and include

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,280
branding workshops that we actually do

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,110
with our businesses because we know that

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,910
they don't have an unlimited budget and

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,510
our goal is if we can get them online

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,880
then the next step now how do we not

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,980
help them to use this as the lever to

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,120
make money right and so this is what

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,260
we're charging and if they wants to make

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,040
your photos a bigger charge a little bit

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,750
more but our goal is for $300 right so

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,920
here that's our goal and so and so we're

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,660
going into neighborhoods doing like

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,670
amazing thing that either all the things

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,200
that are included in it that are part of

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,000
being able to kind of help tell the

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,570
story so some of the business is I don't

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,560
know if you've ever been to if you ever

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,160
seen this gentleman right here

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,970
so here the local business and he's

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,920
think of like Cass Street I think it is

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,870
and he has a men's shop it's called blue

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,150
boutique so working with him so he's a

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:54,230
great entrepreneur doing amazing work

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,760
the food that you had lqb know or a

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,500
speaker I get like the speaker dinner we

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,200
had last night we actually had food from

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,000
southwest right so and so we're the

00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,110
entrepreneurs or the restaurant there we

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,560
actually had a chance to be able to work

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:10,070
with this is a gentleman in um in

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,360
Chicago who had an idea for Sean and he

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:15,750
had no label on the sauce

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,180
but I said why wasn't meaner for the

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:21,300
chief I'm not gonna eat that sauce okay

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,579
okay so the poses me saying it was not

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,290
that okay but but I feel what you're

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,690
saying you're okay I'm gonna put this to

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,370
the side right here we're not yes I know

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,130
but the reason that I'm saying is that

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,920
is that sometimes we allow things to

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,240
stop us from getting started right

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,070
because in this world of social media

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,200
we're all trying to be perfect and what

00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,920
happens that profession is the enemy of

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,720
done and so and so in in this you know

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,570
in this in this fast-paced world of

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,970
24-hour media cycles and seeing the

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,950
slices of everybody's life then we start

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,180
to operate this into one person and

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,890
think that everybody's going on

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,350
vacations every day right and that's not

00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:01,860
happening because all we do is show the

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,149
good highlights and and I'm a victim the

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,130
only time I check in is what I'm in the

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,510
airport at the gym I did a lot of bad

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,279
stuff every night in the heavens in my

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,839
life but you never see that stuff like

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,000
it's all it's all the good stuff right

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,329
so this is kind of what we do and we

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,850
become president sometimes but but i

00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:20,040
commended him because he did not stop a

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,240
label from from having them do what he

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,110
did even though he knew that you need

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,410
this right but I'm challenging to who

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,990
I'm challenging you if you can stand

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,149
point because we always talk about get

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,920
out of the classroom and get out of the

00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:36,480
office and get in front of a customer

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,040
right and try something a figure out

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,199
will works and we're done with solid

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,839
come in then the war with Lopez tires

00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,060
right so some tremendous local business

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,970
they have amazing stories so these

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,620
stories can actually be told and so I

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,050
sort of reasonably want to come here

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,120
today was just too empowering to

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,089
encourage you that the work that you're

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,699
doing like this stuff like it really

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:01,440
really really really matters right

00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,620
because you're working with real people

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,940
sometimes we start to put numbers over

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,730
people and we thought you'd look at

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,250
people and the project or the job but

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,620
like these are real people and how they

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,810
eat and how they manage their family a

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,910
lot is is connected to the work that

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,290
we're actually doing working with more

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,260
companies doing like really really cool

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,970
so these are some of the websites

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,490
at the end of the day what happens here

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,310
is that is that that our work is really

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,610
about humanizing our actual process and

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,770
about understanding and about bringing

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,420
access to amazing businesses so we've

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,750
worked with some active developers here

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,430
so we've worked with Laura all right so

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,350
she did that you know she did the air

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,210
the elk air being on site and she did a

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,580
few more we're also work with Chris I

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,320
think right back there and the Chris's

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,270
work with the tone so we've had a chance

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,280
to work with some local developers but

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:56,030
ultimately our goal is to be able to

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,170
help put good work into their community

00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,340
and to make a difference so what I want

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,770
to do now avow to open up the floor for

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,420
questions because I know I can solve

00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,730
world peace and I can solve hunger with

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,160
all the great things that I'm saying but

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,710
it's the one that every every great

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,240
thinks that they have the answer but I

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,070
understand that people want to hear

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,620
themselves talk so what I want to do is

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,350
out we give you an opportunity to look

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,300
smart to get on video and we can hear

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,850
your song clunking question so again I

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:31,370
just open up the floor for questions

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:33,500
okay right here yes yes we were working

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,110
this whole project started by doing free

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,820
web site we were doing this stuff and it

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,740
was just free and so look to the one

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,730
business and we're live love to help you

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,230
to get a website no we don't need a

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,810
website their website with a flyer

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,830
online I was like literally applied all

00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:51,230
right dude you need a website right but

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:53,780
you know like you can't cost them right

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,280
so if you know if that's fine for you or

00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,660
maybe the bid that's worth because it's

00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,130
in a community and they have enough

00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,600
people coming from the community and

00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,020
they're like you know what I don't need

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,840
your help

00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,550
so you know this how I live my life I

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,790
don't want celebrate it

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:10,190
not where I'm tolerating so so if you

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,720
want my help at this trust me I'll go

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,640
back to that design has all these little

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,680
things going on here there's a lot of

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,510
stuff that I could do with my time so so

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,850
I would rather pour my time and energy

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,290
into people who really want my help so

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,740
that's kind of way I look at thing and

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:27,610
plus I don't take it personal right next

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,610
question okay

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,340
so that's a good thing um so so we try

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,470
to do as much as possible one of the

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,499
challenges that we run into is that a

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:43,019
lot of them are on our own social right

00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:44,700
so so then trying to get them acclimated

00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,159
and trying to figure out what a platform

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,419
to integrate them into because there are

00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:50,279
lots of different platforms that people

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:53,009
have me what platform should you use I

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,529
would rather you focus on one platform

00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:56,879
and pour your time and energy into it

00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:58,739
versus trying to be across the board and

00:17:56,879 --> 00:18:01,080
everything even though from a brand

00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:03,509
standpoint you should secure those

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,869
assets even though you do not own the

00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:09,389
platform securing those handle is a part

00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:10,679
of your IP right so I think that's

00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,379
important so we're trying to get them

00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,539
more acclimated to it but we want to get

00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:17,340
them using platforms that they are going

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:26,639
to be more sustainable and they're going

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:29,279
to actually create content for yeah so

00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:31,139
um so we really started and our process

00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,669
has pivoted we were going we would do

00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:34,649
the workshops and then we would take

00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:37,230
probably a few weeks to get like sites

00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:40,289
actually actually done so now our

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:43,320
process has shifted to doing the main

00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:45,269
work in a single day and our goal is

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,489
because what we realized these actors

00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:48,809
are working 10 to 12 hour days trying to

00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:50,519
get them out of their business for

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,889
multiple days and when you're going into

00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,559
other cities it becomes very difficult

00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:58,379
to be able to do all of those things and

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,720
so now our goal is can we start in the

00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:02,970
morning and by the end of the day take

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,340
you through an entire process and half

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,559
typical now the sites are about 70% done

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,970
but our goal is can we get it all the

00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,369
way there so we just do one in Chicago

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,409
and at the partner I said we had some

00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:15,600
developers who will remote we have some

00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:17,100
developers who were physically there we

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,649
started out walk them through and by the

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,769
end of the day we had we had really put

00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:24,869
a a really big dinner so our goal is to

00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:27,720
be able to do these and abettor make

00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,830
these things happen in a day now there's

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,450
the other thing that happened after that

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,070
we have training we have other stuff

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,330
that we do after that so we have

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,009
webinars and all kind of other things

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,080
that are actually like a part of it

00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:39,359
right so um so it's not like we just

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,710
leave them right but we want to be able

00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,470
to get to a point because with an

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,590
entrepreneur you need to be able to

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,629
like something that you can plead so I

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,669
go to if we can get something done it

00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:51,889
builds their confidence to then want to

00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:53,360
do more stuff and so at the end of the

00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:55,879
day is it a ten thousand dollar website

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,159
no but our goal is we will get you from

00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:59,659
zero to sixty get you online and then

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,700
from there we can look for ways to

00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:03,139
better and plugins and other things to

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,029
be able to make it more functional so we

00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:06,139
can drive economic to the business so

00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:08,210
one of the business that we work with

00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:11,029
with called mommy may a mommy blogger

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,889
who you know got her site up she did an

00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:14,980
event in four days she was able to

00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:17,629
generate a thousand dollars in four days

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,860
so like that's real money so like for

00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:21,470
corporations that might not seem like a

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,629
money but for an entrepreneur to raise

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,820
$1,000 by just putting something online

00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:27,440
that was amazing so now we're gonna help

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,850
her to be able to replicate that right

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:40,970
and that's important and that's real

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:42,080
real money next question so so far I

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,970
think we're probably close to about

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,009
maybe one or two hundred sites you know

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,210
there so we have a lot of work to do and

00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:50,149
what we're doing is that we're spending

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,159
time perfecting the model of kind of how

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,899
the stuff happens right because the more

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,970
efficient that we are in the model it

00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:57,889
will allow us to be able to make this

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:01,309
thing happen and become more of a

00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:04,039
machine as a part of it we need to be

00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:06,500
able to attract other other creatives

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:08,450
and developers and we need to we need to

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,220
be able to pull people part of our model

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,860
is is that that there's a certain

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,080
portion of volunteerism that is going to

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,480
be required as a part of this so what

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,340
John has really kind of challenged me on

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,159
is can you pull together this global

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:25,340
community of thought leaders and of

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,720
creatives and of developers and as we're

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,789
doing it what we're finding is that were

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,519
able to create opportunities for other

00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:34,100
people who need these services right and

00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,259
so we had an event at the Apple store we

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,970
pulled in donor and some other people

00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:39,799
and so we're starting to really start to

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,110
curate this so I would love to be able

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,669
to talk to individuals here if you're a

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,309
developer or creative if you're a

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:48,259
photographer or things like that because

00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:50,539
we would love to be able to make you a

00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:51,090
part of our community or we become a

00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:53,249
part

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,809
of your community right and so and so

00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:57,720
we're definitely interested in being

00:21:54,809 --> 00:22:26,639
able to work with people who have domain

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:29,279
knowledge in their space that's a great

00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:30,929
question and so and so so a brand is

00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,549
more than just logo with more than just

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:33,929
identity and so if you really think

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:39,059
about a brand it's really this

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:40,830
collection of interactions experiences

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:44,570
and touch points that people have with a

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:46,830
person a product an organization a

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,350
thought leader and what it does is that

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,240
it ultimately drives the economics of

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,889
that business and so what happens is

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,470
that everything involves everything

00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:58,049
everything changes and so and so what

00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,940
happens is is that is that that part of

00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:01,529
the process of being an entrepreneur or

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,490
being entrepreneurial is that is that

00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:04,289
you're figuring out what your business

00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,879
model is and so if you figure out the

00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:08,190
business model things naturally change

00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:10,080
right and so and so I don't see anything

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,179
wrong with it but as you're doing it

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,220
there are certain costs that kind of

00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,649
come along with it so if you go invest

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,909
in signage and and all kind of stuff

00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:19,259
that you didn't have to change then

00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,820
there's a higher cost to be able to

00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,070
change those things but when you're

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,669
putting together a brand hour think

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:30,440
about this think about like the actual

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:32,610
the actual name right think about the

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,990
think about the digital real estate

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,690
that's connected to that think about

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:40,110
owning the conversation online because

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,570
that's important right and if you need

00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:47,190
to get a trademark think about now not

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:49,350
all lawyers are equal not all lawyers

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:53,519
are equal now I have I've done

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:55,950
trademarks for $425 right and I ended up

00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,289
having to get a higher price lawyer and

00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,419
we currently use Joffe you know up to

00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:02,340
that yeah yeah that's our actual

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:03,550
actually sold almost things might cost

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,830
$3500

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,030
I can go to sleep at night because I

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,210
know our stuff is secure

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,940
so again but having having the right

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,800
information become important because

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,040
once you develop something that now

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,440
becomes this great asset people then

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:43,360
lack you want to come back and maybe try

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:45,430
to take that from me so I would make the

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,780
change I'll do my research and I'll make

00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,850
sure that if I'm changing to something

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,410
it is something that it makes sense to

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,510
me to chain to so I'm not changing it

00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,460
and then a week later or a month later

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,110
I'm going back and I'm changing it again

00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,570
and then if you have followers online

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,040
you know and there's a whole series of

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,870
things that you have to do just to make

00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,240
sure that those channels are changed I

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:07,510
would I would still maintain the old

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,610
handle and I would just for them you

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,570
know I like to the new handle you know

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,040
since there's a series of things that

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,710
you would do but I'll make the change

00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,210
right you know I'm saying because yes

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,350
there were you talking more detail

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,810
alright so now we have a few more

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:31,030
minutes as any more questions oh we have

00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:32,530
great question about quick so what we've

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,050
done is that we've had channel partners

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,700
in a different stage so locally we have

00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:39,190
worked a lot with tech town which done

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,200
do some work now with Pross for us and

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,580
so so identifying channel partners

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,230
inside of cities have been critically

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,490
important and we've gone to other

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,680
markets we've actually worked with

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,510
university anchors we've also had

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,430
Economic Development Corporation's in

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,230
Newark and things like that that allows

00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,760
that I already have a list of businesses

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,380
so we don't need to go affected

00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,970
businesses out well starting to happen

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,430
now that we're starting to head now have

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:03,130
actual I get like municipal partners

00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,930
actually reaching out to us so so we're

00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,510
in conversation right now with the city

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,770
of Liverpool and sort of smart city like

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,090
reached out to us and they want us to

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,710
work with about a hundred businesses

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,570
there and so I'm excited because I've

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,740
never been to the UK before and so I

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:20,570
said we can work on this and I go to you

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:22,940
right now no but but I mean so it's been

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,710
interesting but our goal is is that is

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,480
that as we start to develop more

00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,760
relationships it gives us an opportunity

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,890
to be able to have different types of

00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,620
conversations and to be able to target

00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,309
different kind of entrepreneurs so so if

00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,600
we have Economic Development

00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:38,090
Corporation's there are people who would

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,289
love to scholarship neighborhood then we

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,080
can go on and work with a specific

00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:46,899
community of entrepreneurs in that in

00:26:42,080 --> 00:27:05,899
that actual GL alright next question

00:26:46,899 --> 00:27:07,820
okay so it's the combination of all

00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:10,399
those so now there's a perception that

00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,080
that this hopefully thousands of miles

00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,390
like it will confound it off so we don't

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,179
even ask the question right so part of

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:19,460
it is going to be like this perception

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:22,870
then where do you find the developer ed

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,820
right so so like I'm in the space and

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,529
and so I kind of know where to go but

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,600
imagine being an entrepreneur and you've

00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:31,490
already had a couple bad experiences you

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,590
know or you've had somebody develop the

00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,720
site and you can't find them anymore and

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,720
then once you can't find them and then

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,340
that thing now is outdated and so now

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,500
you even know how to log in so now they

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,669
have a series of those kind of issues or

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,830
they feel like I don't even need it

00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:48,679
because I'm an Instagram so like I don't

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,419
need it right and maybe if you have a

00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,190
sneaker boutique and you have stickers

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,360
that are going to drop it works but now

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,770
sometimes they're like I don't need it

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,659
because I can Jess I can do something at

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,000
Facebook right so it's a series of

00:27:56,659 --> 00:28:01,130
things but a lot of it is building this

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,500
trust and what we want to do is that

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,789
because there's many times when we start

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,809
to work with that and I tour and they're

00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:07,610
going to need to work with other

00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,230
developers even beyond us and we want to

00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,090
be able to connect developers that we

00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,429
know to the business owners because they

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,919
need to have people local and people

00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,600
that they trust right so what's a series

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,340
of reasons why we're trying to build

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,600
that trust becomes critically important

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:26,169
I know I stand between you and lunch box

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,169
okay right

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,100
yeah so so even even even in our process

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,690
we have identified people who are

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:07,410
outside of the scope of what we do and

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,990
so we met this company that does they

00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,420
are they're based in Newark and they and

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,670
they are an organic I think farm you

00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,620
know right inside of the city of Newark

00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:20,610
and they are and they're the largest

00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,590
vertical farm in America right and so

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,810
and so they wanted to work with us but

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,400
their project didn't fit inside of this

00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,900
but because of the other work we had a

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,220
chance to bid and meet them and other

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,410
things they become other leads for other

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,930
people that we can work with right so

00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:37,170
what we found is that we focused on one

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:39,570
specific customer but doing that has

00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,280
given us visibility into other customers

00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,250
so I think part of part of what you're

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,350
saying is okay how do i target my exact

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,120
audience right to be able to identify

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,980
people who can pay for the services or

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,960
things but I think the main thing is

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,940
that people have to be able to see the

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,850
work that you do right and be able to

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,460
connect and be able to experience that

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:01,980
it's like like if you say that you're

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,560
worth $10,000 I want to be able to like

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:07,230
like that website better sing and do all

00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:12,090
kinda like sing stuff for $10 dollars

00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:13,720
for me right no no I mean I didn't mean

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,309
it like that

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,799
because I'm sure you don't do a flash

00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:19,120
sites and stuff like that right now but

00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:21,610
at the end of the day I'm just saying

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,919
you know I like that's yeah that's a

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,669
very specific customer most of the

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,750
opportunities that that I've talked to

00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,370
you know that's way above their price

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,039
grade right so you know instead so

00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,750
understanding that customer and and

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,549
being able to specifically target that I

00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,929
think would be would be actually key

00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:39,039
what are some of the testimonies what

00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:42,879
are some of the things that you're doing

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,830
from a from a call to action in terms of

00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:46,929
being able to get people down your

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,820
funnel I'll never forget there was a guy

00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,740
that I was actually interested in and do

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,690
some work with and so I get this guy

00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,570
with a consult and so I guess here this

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,909
funnel and so and so I emailed them

00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,470
followed back up with this guy and then

00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:01,480
and then and then this machine that

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,190
started happening he was like okay so if

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,169
you want to talk to me you can set up

00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,480
the first call which is $1,000

00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,070
I was like I was like dude there's

00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,470
nobody on the planet that I'm gonna

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,970
spend $1,000 on a phone call with and

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,889
then started getting these other emails

00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,830
that you know I need to set up this

00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:20,710
consulting thing with them and it'll be

00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:23,409
$1500 and we had to do it for 3 months

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,600
and so sometimes we set up these funnels

00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:27,879
or these mouse traps that are not

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,889
humanized right and they're and they're

00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:31,690
based on stuff that we've read online so

00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:33,039
we read all the stuff online about all

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,679
these things these are the five steps

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,049
that you do and maybe it works for Chris

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,750
Brogan you know and you know he's going

00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:43,360
and making 10 20 30 40 thousand dollars

00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,799
right so but for everybody else you have

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,809
to figure out something that's going to

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,159
be humanized that's going to be able to

00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:50,230
work to be able to get to the target

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,179
customer that you want right and as an

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,950
entrepreneur we have challenges because

00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:58,090
we have to understand our price I'll

00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:01,299
never forget I was speaking at this at

00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:03,220
this pharmaceutical company and and I

00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,690
was on a phone call with them and we're

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,460
trying to you know and they're asked me

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,399
like my price and I gave them alcohol

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,720
was a pretty good price so then I ended

00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:12,399
up meeting the lady who was over

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,649
financed after I had did my thing and

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,690
she was like hi she was the best figure

00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:19,110
that we had all year and when you gave

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:22,990
your price online we you know we fringed

00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:25,410
so I undersold myself by thirty thousand

00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:31,170
dollars now I mean not now

00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:33,180
once I told my wife of this whole

00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,430
frustration level with Russia he was

00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:38,430
left that much money on the table so

00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,200
because for me I didn't know anybody in

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:44,480
my circle that had made that much money

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,220
for speaking for an hour right so now

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,050
now it took me two years I got the money

00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,470
back but took me two years to get there

00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:54,150
right but the whole point was was

00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,370
understanding how money works in

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,140
understanding pricing and as an

00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,630
entrepreneur we've all miss price stuff

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,980
if you haven't missed anything that

00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,530
means that you're not an entrepreneur I

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,630
mean because like I and and when you had

00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:09,030
a wrong customer what happens those are

00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:11,130
the worst right because they dumped me

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,500
because like they have champagne tastes

00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:16,020
and kool-aid money right and so and so

00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,090
did that become a challenge so again

00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,440
pricing stuff becomes important but you

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,610
learn to step over time I think I have

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:27,050
time for a couple more questions before

00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:27,050
we go any more questions okay right here

00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:55,140
yes so as a part of our process we will

00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,730
continue to evolve it and so there are

00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,560
some people that already have sites and

00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,720
so we might export content from

00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,370
something that they already have at the

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,140
part what we're doing is that and then

00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:06,630
we're creating these boot camps that are

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,340
like four-day experiences and then we're

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,860
gonna start to have other of the other

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,480
educational things that I actually offer

00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,220
but the main thing is that we had to get

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,740
the main part of the process tight

00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,060
because if we don't develop the site

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,010
right it doesn't matter about all the

00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,899
other stuff that we do right and then

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,120
and then on top of that how do you

00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:25,890
package that and communicate that to

00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,480
somebody because at first we were

00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:29,280
telling people we do websites it and

00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,380
that's like saying okay I'm gonna sell

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,770
you an engine where we're really selling

00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,330
a car because we have we have we have we

00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,010
have photography branding all these

00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,329
other

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,339
so even trying to put all the stuff

00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:42,050
together so that they could understand

00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:44,450
the whole value of what they're getting

00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,399
right becomes critically important and

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,659
the stories that you hear like I was

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,030
gonna fall with the young lady yesterday

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:52,609
and I was like she was running through

00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,129
her life history she was telling me how

00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:56,690
she had barriers of entry to work tell

00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:58,040
me how she couldn't vote I mean like she

00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,230
was running through she didn't have a

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,880
birth certificate like I mean I was like

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,530
ma'am this story is getting a little too

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,809
deep for me right now I mean like I was

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:09,290
she was giving me her whole life story

00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:11,270
and I say that because the work that

00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,400
we're doing is like it's like it's

00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:18,309
really impact one's really work with

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,309
extremely real people right okay yep

00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,990
clients a fire good friends of mine who

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,440
are grew up in a youth department with

00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:33,770
were working with me end of the day you

00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:37,040
should never hire anybody I mean yes I

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:39,440
mean because the day is just it's not

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,809
going to work right and so what I've

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,450
realized with certain clients I remember

00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:46,430
doing this and then then I get document

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,660
back from them legal stuff and that you

00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,359
know just all kinds of different things

00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,829
but what I've done is that I've always

00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:56,720
made sure that I deliver what I say I

00:35:51,829 --> 00:36:01,940
was going to do and and then it's time

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:04,339
for us to stop then what I do is you

00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,890
know then I move on because it because

00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:08,030
at the end of the day the mind is more

00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,710
important I don't care how much money

00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,710
you have at the end of that my peace of

00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,910
mind is free and that's critical

00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,010
I don't know we have one more question

00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,390
before we wrap it up a week okay I asked

00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,040
last question and we're done and that

00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:23,960
can ask you questions offline whatever

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,609
but that is a great question so we got a

00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,290
slide right here we got a hook quick

00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,720
slot okay so we're seeking developers

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,329
