Title: Kellen Mace: How to Build Your First Gutenberg Block
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	Learn how to write a WordPress plugin that registers custom Gutenberg blocks and build out those blocks to provide an instant preview/feedback as theyâ€™re being edited in the wp-admin, as well as how to render them on the front end of the site.
This session is part 2 of our 3-part Gutenberg track. Check out session 1: Introduction to Gutenberg Development and session 3: GutenPanel

well okay

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,580
all right cool so yeah Brian Brian did a

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,080
great job with the overview of

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,939
Guttenberg just kind of looking peeking

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,019
under the hood a little bit to see what

00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:22,980
types of you know functions and

00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,839
JavaScript objects and everything are

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,970
available to us to do Gutenberg

00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,419
development my goal with this second

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,290
half here is to provide some practical

00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:38,400
examples so what we're gonna do is I'm

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,700
going to show like a few scenarios I'm a

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,260
few examples of like let's say client

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,960
ABC came to you and said I want a

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,580
Guttenberg block that does XY and Z how

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,860
would we build that start to finish like

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,170
what tool would we use to scaffold that

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,690
out and provide this like build tool for

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,970
us we get into what why that's necessary

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,670
and a few slides here so we're told we

00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,320
pick for that through two how do we

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,720
actually code up the block so that they

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,280
show up in the WordPress admin and then

00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,560
function like the way this client is

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,090
asking for we're going to do that twice

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,829
if we have enough time we'll do it once

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,319
with this static call to action block

00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:16,590
and then a second one with this dynamic

00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:20,609
block that will go reach out to the

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,490
WordCamp Detroit site but the JIT REST

00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:25,649
API and point to grab its latest posts

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,240
and then shoot those into the page

00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,280
dynamically so anytime there's a new

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,979
post published it was always show the

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,109
most recent content so that's what we're

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,359
gonna dive into you here my name is

00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,530
kelan mace I'm there to get my intro at

00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,179
the beginning so likely I won't spend

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,270
too much time but I work so somebody

00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:44,039
called web dev studios and I my twitter

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,319
handle is there so this point I'll take

00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:54,329
a brief brief pause to send out my

00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:55,439
slides Suzanne okay if you had a for

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,100
those of you who want to follow along

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,020
with the slides or if you want the the

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,189
code repository as well we're gonna be

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,109
working on it I have all the finished

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,029
the two finished blocks that we're gonna

00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:08,459
work on I have that this github link

00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:12,020
right there anyway let's go to that site

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,020
you can grab both of them right there

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,100
all right so with that we'll keep

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,200
rolling so we'll start off with talking

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,760
about those real-world code code

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,100
challenges I mentioned like what those

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,510
are what they're all about so this is

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,180
the first request that we got from our

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,400
client here so client request number one

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,350
you're the developer you're on deck it's

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,860
up to you to implement this right the

00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,960
client supercool client as matter came

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,460
to you and said I want to spread the

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,880
word about word can't you try it on my

00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,860
site

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,080
I'd like a Guttenberg block that I can

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,750
use as a call to action it should

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,300
include the option to select an image

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,850
have an area for rich text below that

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,610
and I want the whole thing to link to a

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,080
URL that I choose all right so some of

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,580
you if you've been doing WordPress

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,050
development for a little bit you

00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,360
probably built things like this before

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:03,680
using tools like you know advanced

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,440
custom fields or you know pick list or

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,330
CMB - things like that right but and

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,580
those you know work great and have for

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,440
years the benefit that we get doing this

00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,160
in Gutenberg though is that we get a

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,350
live preview of this data so the user as

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,090
by mentions it's more of a true what you

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,040
see is what you get so instead of just

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,239
filling in a few fields in like an

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,980
advanced custom fields

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,769
you know meta box and and the guest

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,970
thing out like I hope this looks looks

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,620
right in the front and let me go check

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,630
you have to save it and then go to

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,670
front-end to actually get some some real

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,370
feedback right with Gutenberg the

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,850
advantage is as we're editing it in the

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,610
admin that little preview that the is

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,650
working on its live updating so what it

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,910
looks like right like right there will

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,860
be what it looks like on the front end

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,630
of the site what makes this really great

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,330
editing experience in my opinion it's

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,130
gonna make WordPress help WordPress to

00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,310
stay competitive with some of these

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,750
other platforms they're coming about due

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,549
to this really rich like editing

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,310
experience that Gutenberg is going to

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,100
provide for us so so it's the first the

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,440
first challenge that will code up today

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,440
it's gonna look like this so this is

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,310
Jews so they've chosen this white image

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,780
they plop that right there and then

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,910
below that I get a lot of which text

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,500
field so they have like entered one text

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,800
here hit enter to create a new paragraph

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,720
and then another line here and then

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
behind-the-scenes we'll have one other

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,099
field to specify a URL so if anybody

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,289
clicks on this banner here this call to

00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:35,180
action it'll then link them to whatever

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,340
you are all the clients specified so

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,810
that's the first thing we're gonna build

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,330
the second one on that we'll get to

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,800
after that is this one again super cool

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,590
client they were so impressed with you

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,060
the first time they came back again this

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,889
time they want you to build a dynamic

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,180
block so stepping it up a little bit

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,780
well we'll get the difference between

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,669
those two

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,710
Brian mention it but we'll reinforce it

00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:57,080
so the client comes back again and said

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,569
I'd like I might also like a block that

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,270
pulls in the most recent word camp

00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:05,479
Detroit blog posts just their titles and

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,490
links to them would be great I'd like to

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,370
be able to control how many posts are

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,500
displayed and my designer has provided

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,659
you with an SVG that we'd like to use

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,300
for the blocks icon in the WordPress

00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,680
admin for the reason bate they have a

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,750
certain icon they think their team will

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,509
recognize well and they provide that as

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,030
an SVG so they want that in the oval

00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:29,000
gutenberg block chooser near a tool they

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,960
want us to use that icon for them so

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,819
this one's a little different right

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,919
because we can't just take what the user

00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,330
has the values they've given us in those

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,940
fields and just save them to the

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:41,779
database and call Conley call it done

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,279
because this one we want this to be to

00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,080
be dynamically to pull in the blog post

00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,479
so if five minutes from now or camp

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,310
Detroit publishes a new one anytime

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,479
anybody reloads that page it's there

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,340
it's going to show that that new block

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,090
for us so we'll see like how that's even

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,349
possible so we're gonna accomplish with

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,669
the rest of this session and then the

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:03,620
next one is as well so that second that

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,960
second challenge then for the dynamic

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,300
block that one goes to post it'll just

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,889
like look like this right so they'll be

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,259
able to control like how many are shown

00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:14,389
and it'll just be you know anchor tags

00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,669
links to those blog posts on it that

00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,279
folks can click on this I'm super cool

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,990
clients website alright so where to

00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,699
start if we if you were just tasked with

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,289
with this to put these two blocks

00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,740
together where would you even start

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:29,569
right there are a few ways you can do

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,880
this one is to roll your own WordPress

00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:33,469
plug-in so those are your familiar you

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,060
know writing a new plug-in you could

00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:36,500
start by doing that

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,970
absolutely

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,530
but there are some challenges there with

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,510
because we're using all this modern

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,880
JavaScript tooling it gets pretty darn

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,190
complex we'll visit that in a minute

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,110
next one is you can use WP COI that

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,100
stands for command-line interface so if

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,020
you're somebody come through on the

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,870
command line there's a command to build

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,070
these blocks so we'll see you like how

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,530
that how that goes

00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,810
upsides and downsides there last one is

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:03,200
create this tool called create guten

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,730
block it's it's really great tool we'll

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,410
talk about pros and cons of that down as

00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,230
well so go through each of those real

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,360
quick here first option I mention is

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,580
roll your own plugin all right so this

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,000
one in order to do this you must be

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,430
familiar with configuring web pack and a

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,710
number of NPM modules to set up the

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,120
build process if that sounds like a

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,100
little foreign to you like something you

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,669
haven't done before be prepared to spend

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,860
lots of hours doing that it takes it

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,750
takes quite a bit to you know to

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,500
configure all the stuff and wet wire it

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,570
up to produce the the resulting

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,610
JavaScript and CSS files that would be

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:45,590
sent to the browser there's a lot lot to

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:47,510
that alright and beyond now you also be

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,880
responsible for managing any of those

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,310
dependencies yourself going forward so

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,430
both web pack Excel itself as as well as

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,440
any NPM modules you're using to to build

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,229
this whole app that we're going to talk

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,940
about if those like have version updates

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,860
or need to be swapped out or one of them

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,450
is deprecated like it's up to you to

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,190
swap those out right so this can become

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,690
a little cumbersome and requires a lot

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,100
of knowledge to do that so I would

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:15,650
recommend against that if you're not

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:17,060
super super comfortable cool ok this

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,090
session is almost done we'll have like

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,979
cool minutes one minute okay cool I'll

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,630
go through just just this slide and then

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:26,570
we'll break to talk about the winner

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,090
that I'm gonna propose to you which is

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,160
the last tool next one is WP CI it does

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,110
have a command dump you scaffold block

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,640
that will scaffold out a block for you

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,099
there a couple downsides to that though

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,260
at this point it doesn't support modern

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,409
tooling like that whole web pack build

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,630
process I was talking about this makes

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,820
writing evenly mild come mildly complex

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,530
blocks a little more cumbersome instead

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,040
of writing them out so that they look

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,860
like

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,970
our cup you instead have to use on the

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,430
techniques Brian was talking about or

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,070
you call this L function and pass it the

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,779
type of element you want it to create it

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,279
doesn't even look like HTML you just

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,500
have to imagine that it's creating that

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,120
after the fact it makes things difficult

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,069
so I would advise against against that

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,639
and then you can't use the majority of

00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:09,259
pre-built

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,060
react components you'll come across on

00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:13,130
the web because most folks who use react

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,550
which as Brian said is the technology

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,889
underlying Guttenberg most folks who use

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,810
that use this JSX syntax I'm talking

00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:23,240
about so if you're abandoning that and

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,860
you're going to for the WP CLI route and

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,630
not you know doing any active anything

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,579
extra like the tooling and stuff we

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,410
talked about you're not going to be able

00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:31,970
to use any of their libraries all right

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,230
so what we'll do instead what I'll

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,560
recommend to you is using this create

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,040
guten block tool so break now now good

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,940
okay

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,709
well break now and then let's talk about

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,160
like to perk why we've chosen that tool

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:44,660
and then proceed with like actually

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,149
spinning up a new WordPress point and

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:51,199
using this and then building our blocks

00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:53,000
from there are two two example blocks

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:55,069
from super cool client right the first

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,230
one was our static one for the call to

00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:58,970
action that they have a few fields to

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,680
customize and then that second dynamic

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,949
line whether it'll be it'll be able to

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,209
reach out to your camp Detroit site site

00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:07,190
and then generate a list of blog posts

00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,589
and that one will be you know update

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,930
every time there's a page reload or grab

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,550
the data fresh all right so break for

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:19,220
that and then I'll meet you back here in

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:21,920
a few okay hello everybody welcome back

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,680
is anybody joining us now that wasn't in

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,470
the previous session yeah okay couple

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,860
cool I'll do a little five-second recap

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:34,310
then what we're doing today so this

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:37,010
morning Brian Richards my companion here

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:39,010
was kind enough to do like an intro to

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,120
Guttenberg like some of the underlying

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,649
tech and functions and stuff like that

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,069
and for the second half of the

00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,839
presentation here we're trying to do

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:50,180
some practical examples so we'll do some

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,490
live coding of like here's how to build

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,050
a few Guttenberg blocks start to finish

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,850
if you were asked to do this today

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,810
how would you even do that search finish

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,059
so that's what I'll be addressing so for

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,819
our real world coach

00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:05,919
we had super cool client come to us and

00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,449
said that they want one call-to-action

00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,009
block that's going to look something

00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,499
like this when we're done they can shoot

00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:13,959
select an image some text and then you

00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:15,909
are out to link to then they came back

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,349
they were so impressed with us from that

00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,359
first block they came back and said I'd

00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:21,369
also like a block the pulls in the most

00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:23,259
recent work camp Detroit blog posts so

00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:24,099
we're gonna create a second block that

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:27,279
looks like this

00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:30,339
it just outputs the posts for Camp

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,929
Detroit and this is always dynamic data

00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,429
so if Lord can't be troit five minutes

00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:35,709
from now publishes a new blog post

00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:38,589
anytime anybody hits this page it'll

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:40,989
pull in that that new post so I take a

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,489
look at how to do both of those in the

00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:44,469
previous section I talked about like how

00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:46,359
do you even get started then building

00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:47,499
these Guttenberg blocks and the answer

00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:51,189
is you need some kind of WordPress

00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:53,919
plug-in to provide those so not because

00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:56,169
we roll your own plugin which requires a

00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,499
lot of knowledge on how to configure web

00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:00,729
pack and a number of NPM modules it gets

00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:02,319
be prepared to spend like hours and

00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:04,329
hours doing that another one is to use

00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:06,039
double PCI but out of the box it doesn't

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,719
come with that modern tooling either

00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,329
so the solution I was recommending is

00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:14,319
used using this tool called create guten

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:16,989
block it's similar to if anybody's

00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:20,079
familiar to create react app if you have

00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:21,999
a devil devil into react it was painful

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,919
for a while building anything in react

00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:25,779
because you had to do this this whole

00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,689
tooling setup I'm talking about you had

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:31,089
to do this all yourself it was very

00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:33,039
cumbersome so the engineer the fake

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,779
Facebook created this library that's a

00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:40,059
single dependency called create react

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:43,059
app so if you run that one command it

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:45,459
will create a new react app for you and

00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:47,439
it manages all the dependencies that

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:49,359
your app requires on are kind of hidden

00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:50,829
behind the scenes and all you have to

00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:52,119
worry about is that one dependency so

00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:54,699
make it super easy you have nothing to

00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:57,699
manage when Gutenberg hit the scene on

00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:59,229
the sky Ahmad ouais who's a corpus core

00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,709
contributor really active in the

00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:01,689
community

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,249
he created here's inspired by create

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:05,739
react up and creates really similar tool

00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:08,109
called create guten block the idea is

00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:10,419
the same this thing only has a single

00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:11,919
NPM dependency so you're not to worry

00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:13,880
about like setting up this root super

00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,550
complicated build process

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,350
this developer toolkit like does all

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,060
that for you so I really recommend it

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,590
this is are using at my company web dev

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,410
studios for our internal Guttenberg

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:26,750
block plugin that we've built so what

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:31,310
does is it configures web pack Babel

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:33,800
yes next yes Lynch for linting react

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,090
sass and so on all for use you can get

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,520
started building blocks right away

00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:40,070
instead of configuring how all of those

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,950
things work by yourself I have the link

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,050
there a github as well before we proceed

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,580
also I should mention if you're in the

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,740
first session if you want to follow

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,230
along with the slides right here I've I

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,720
just tweeted a link to the slides as

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,910
well as this github repo where you can

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,860
see the finished blocks so the call to

00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,470
action block and then also that recent

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,510
blog post one they're both in that repo

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,100
so if you just go to a tour comm slash

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:08,360
kelan mace you can find both of those

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,040
alright so with that this is our chosen

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,310
to Levin so what I'm gonna recommend to

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,870
you

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,760
so with our next phase of the

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,200
presentation here we'll talk about how

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,970
do you do that then if you once you've

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,100
chosen your tool how you create a new

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,710
plug-in using create guten block so

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,110
that's a little cover next year alright

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:27,890
so first first one here is to create

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,440
your new plugin so if you go to the the

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,730
create guten block github page I linked

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,370
on the previous slide there it will tell

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,170
you how to install that tool it's really

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,640
easy there's only like one or two lines

00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,200
on the command line that you would need

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,580
to run to get that installed once you've

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,260
done that though then you're ready to

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,360
actually create a new WordPress plug-in

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,660
have it scaffold out a new plugin for

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,940
you

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,350
so first before we do anything build

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,030
anything on top of you in word I

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,040
recommend having good bring itself

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,630
probably good idea right so if you don't

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,440
have that already on your WordPress site

00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:59,570
I would just clone that down you can do

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,570
this two ways you can from the

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,830
wordpress.org plugins repo you can in

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,930
your WordPress install you can go to add

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,630
new and then add the Gutenberg plug-in

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,040
or you could if you're comfortable with

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,110
get on the command line you could run

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,820
this command to clone it out I'll

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,340
recommend this method though cuz if you

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,670
get the one from wordpress.org it

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,440
doesn't include all of the source files

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,120
and those are become really handy if

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,490
you're gonna be serious about building

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,960
Guttenberg blocks you'll want to look

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,760
into this plug-in because it

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,800
all kinds of examples all kinds of

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,090
pre-written blocks so you can look at

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,280
those and see what how the core team

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,380
does it and then kind of emulate that

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,640
and your blocks is super helpful so I

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,590
was like I'm doing it this way and not

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,900
getting it from or again just so you

00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,090
have all the original source files for

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,830
all those blocks alright so once you

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,690
have that we can create the new plugin

00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,730
in your plugins folder so whatever we're

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,350
press it-- you want to get started on

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,840
you just run this one command right here

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,880
and px create goon block and then give

00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,080
it some kind of name so for us we're

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,030
gonna do WC Det blocks alright and then

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,250
next one just run this command on the

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,740
command line CD and then the name of

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,590
that new block just to go into that new

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,180
folder that we've created alright so at

00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,750
this point I'll start doing some of the

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:17,270
live coding live demos always go great

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,160
as you know so if things break I

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,670
apologize hesitant I'll try not to let

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,820
that happen

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,710
as best as I can alright cool so here's

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,240
my local site I just word camp Detroit

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,100
site and this is where we're going to

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,860
scaffold out a new plugin and build our

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,320
blocks alright so on the command line

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,910
I've done all I've done so far is just

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,180
what I mentioned in the previous slide

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,280
where I ran that npx create gouta block

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,710
and I gave it a name right I get some

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,910
output here it says you know creating

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:48,710
and then the directory is called that

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,530
and then all done go build some

00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,410
guttenberg blocks it says right and then

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,450
as a few recommendations at the end that

00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,350
this create Boonton block tool outputs

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:02,060
says get started so that screens a

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,530
little cut off isn't it it says get

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,520
started we suggest that you begin by

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:09,290
typing and then CD the name of that

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,089
folder so you didn't go into that folder

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:17,990
and then npm start i'm gonna get this

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:23,330
where we can see it yeah there we go

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:26,060
okay alright so so i'll do what it's

00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:29,960
suggesting will do will do CD into that

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:34,420
directory and then NPM starch alright so

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,420
here I am I'm inside of my newly created

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:40,010
plugin that the creek guten block has

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,460
scaffold it out so now I want to run NPM

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,460
star

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:49,960
it'll start the build process so look

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,030
for any file changes and then whenever

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,490
make any chop any changes it will run

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:57,850
webpack again and turn all of my

00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,260
reactant JSX and yes next all these

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,900
crazy terms they'll take all of that

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,090
turned into the javascript file they get

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,460
sent to the browser and it shows up

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,470
there so here it is it says it was

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,120
compiled successfully the first time and

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,289
now it's watching for changes so from

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,500
here on out any changes that make

00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:16,299
they'll continue building that to see

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,130
exactly like what we're even talking

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,740
about here what that create gutten block

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,450
thing has done for us this is what my

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,570
site looks like right now so if I go

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,039
into that particular plugin that we just

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:34,650
created this is what it does for us here

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:34,650
so there's one one file certainly

00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:53,919
so I had I had pulled up our finished

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,580
example but not the new example that

00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,490
we're gonna go about both will be

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,649
important but all right cool back on

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,929
track now all right so this is what that

00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:07,659
create guten block has created for us it

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,909
gives you this plug in dot PHP which is

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:11,470
very very simplistic you'll recognize

00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:13,330
this if you're built a wordpress plugin

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,360
your so our usual headers on top there

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,909
and then just requires this image file

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,909
that kicks off the rest of the plugin if

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:24,039
we look at an it then so the source in

00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:25,960
it this is that file that it calls write

00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,720
right here that it requires if you're

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,799
looking here it's calling in cue block

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,440
assets and that it's calling this file

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,750
that is so these are the block assets

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,700
for both the front-end and back-end so

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,309
here's a CF CSS file that's used in both

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,070
places and this one says in queue block

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,450
assets for the backend editor' only so

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,250
this is only needed in the WordPress

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,500
admin and we're just loading up the

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,019
JavaScript files right right here and

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,110
the CSS file as well so that's it for in

00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:58,779
it so what this tool does for you is it

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:02,080
takes everything inside of the source

00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:04,029
folder right here any any blocks that

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,159
you may create here it'll take all all

00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,889
of that code it'll bundle it up and

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,629
it'll produce three files in the end

00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:12,730
that it puts it into this dist folder

00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:14,529
distance four like distributable files

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,629
or the files that will be distributed to

00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,519
the browser so what it does for us is in

00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:20,289
the end it just creates these three

00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,679
files that we send to our WordPress site

00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:25,690
since blocks now build that yes editor

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,460
build yes and it's styled bilges

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,169
so two of those are used only in order

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,120
press admin because you only only need

00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:32,440
them as you're editing the file and then

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,830
any of they're needed on the front-end

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,690
would be in the this style CSS files

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,570
include in front of their offering

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,590
styling that block needs all right so

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,970
that's what the tool we're gonna do for

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,399
us it's gonna create anything we build

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,740
and we creating source it's going to

00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:49,240
ultimately create these three files and

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,500
it's gonna listen for any changes so

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,169
like I said so any changes we make to

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,419
things in source it will detect that now

00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,700
build these new files and then spit them

00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:59,460
out right there so if we just reload the

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,950
page we'll see our changes right away

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,169
all right so with that said

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,519
let's keep trucking alright so we've

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,019
done this so far we create our new

00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,669
plugin and we moved into that directory

00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,399
and taking a little look around to see

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:13,559
what's there right next year as a few

00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:15,840
housekeeping and customization things I

00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:18,809
recommend so for whatever reason this

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:23,100
framework names the main plugin that

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:24,659
means how plugin dot PHP which you've

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,419
been around the WordPress space for a

00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,489
while like the best standard practice is

00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,169
usually to give it to the same name you

00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:34,460
know as the plugin plugin folder that's

00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:37,049
what I like to do so I'll do WC Det

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,600
blocks I'd recommend doing that instead

00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:42,869
of just like plug-in and uh PHP so they

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,820
made it to that next one add a check for

00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,679
the core Gutenberg plug-in if Gutenberg

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,889
is not active then just play an admin

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,940
error message and deactivate our plug-in

00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:52,679
that's something that this firmer

00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,989
doesn't do out of the box either as I

00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,700
mentioned here it just you know what

00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:58,919
requires that file right away

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,080
without even knowing if Gutenberg is

00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,340
even active active yet so that's

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,379
something I would recommend adding as

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:11,509
well I had some code we can paste in to

00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:11,509
do that there

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,770
all right so spent too much time on this

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,870
but we're just saying when the plugins

00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,970
get loaded we're gonna call this

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,909
function right here it will check if the

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,490
register block type function exists if

00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:38,590
it does not then we're going to display

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,740
an admin notice right here that says

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,780
we're camp Detroit Guttenberg box

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,580
requires that the gutenberg plug-in is

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,950
activated and they're gonna deactivate

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,539
our plugin so that's it has Gutenberg as

00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,260
a hard dependency right it can't work

00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:55,630
without it if that's not true though if

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,429
this code doesn't run because the

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,010
function does exist then it will just

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,570
proceed on to require the file what we

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,820
need and that we need and load up the

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:08,830
for yeah all right so I'll just grab all

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:10,299
of this and paste it into our new plugin

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,770
that we have right here so instead of

00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:13,990
just the require I would recommend

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:17,320
pasting this in so I'll save that and

00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,000
now let's give that a test in in our

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,230
browser so I'll go to the admin let's

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,240
try this out we'll go to the plugins

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:29,679
page alright so here's the core

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,590
Guttenberg point select this I'll try to

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,150
deactivate that and then I'll try to

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,620
activate ours this is the new plugin we

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,429
created there and it shouldn't let me

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,870
yeah it's like it's a get this you know

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:43,870
message here it says sorry Gutenberg is

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,610
required please install it so we're

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:51,820
doing the reverse order then right if I

00:23:45,610 --> 00:24:06,330
backed the Gutenberg and now I try it's

00:23:51,820 --> 00:24:06,330
all or what WDS good right

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,710
dang it go live demo I was going swell

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:20,460
alright so for the sake of time we will

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,710
not get that cool so that's in the get

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,780
up repo it's coded the correct way there

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,850
so nice for now we're just leaving like

00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,010
it all right the other housekeeping

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,900
items I had I would recommend doing are

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,700
we've already connect or so we know that

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,980
what these two folders are here so let's

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,480
skip that I would create a blocks folder

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,780
inside of source since we plan on

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,420
creating more than one block with this

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,010
with this tool what it does is inside of

00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,320
source right here it just has the

00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,810
example block living right there but

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,850
this can get a little confusing if you

00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:53,330
plan to add if you need any other

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,620
directories so like my for my company's

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,080
plugin that we use for gutten blocks if

00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,880
we look inside of source right here like

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,620
we have blocks where they've nested all

00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,900
of our blocks you have components which

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,280
are some things that are shared by a few

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,190
of the blocks just like kind of shared

00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,900
components in there we have a SAS folder

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,910
with some like global style stuff in

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,800
there template tag so anyway thank you

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,910
if you start dumping all your blocks

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,920
right here you don't really have any

00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,810
room to have any other directors like

00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,900
that so I would recommend like nesting

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,490
at one level more deeply some side of

00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,580
source here I would create a new folder

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,320
and call it blocks and then just this

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,210
example block that the plugin provides

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:36,090
to us we can put that inside of there

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:37,710
instead alright alright and then put so

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,900
yeah we just did this create a new block

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:43,440
folder and then put the example block

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:49,820
inside of that alright after that point

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:51,930
we'll need to make one change let me see

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,110
alright and then inside that example

00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:57,420
block it comes with a block JS file that

00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:01,140
when I would recommend change index J s

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:03,180
and I'll show you why here so here's the

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,400
example block you can see the name that

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,840
it comes with is block a yes but that's

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,960
kind of non-standard you look inside of

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,470
guttenberg all the main the main file

00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:16,560
for every so every goon road block is

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,670
named index J is not blocked it j s and

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,320
that makes it easier when you actually

00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,840
import them to see this file blocks

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,580
yes this tell this is how webpack knows

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,139
where to look for all of your blocks

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,789
right here let's see how we had to go

00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:31,000
down to the file right here we had to

00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:32,649
say block J s if you use index as a file

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,649
name but you don't even need any of this

00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:37,600
you can just you can just say import

00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:39,159
block and that's it

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,360
in our case though because we nested at

00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,509
one level more deeply we would have

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,909
states blocks and then block but again

00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:47,019
you don't need that like index J ass or

00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:49,360
whatever the file name is you can leave

00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:52,450
that off if you chosen to call it index

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:56,529
so we'll do that as well so I'll save

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:58,629
that and I didn't mention either that as

00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,519
this tool is running it will report out

00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:00,850
on any errors that occur so here's one

00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,700
right here

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:09,220
so can't resolve oh I typed a block

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:11,909
block instead of black spot there we go

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,909
save that

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,609
thank you that's all right okay in back

00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,139
stature there we go okay you can see a

00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:32,329
turn to green here compiled successfully

00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:35,059
so that means we went to look inside the

00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:36,799
blocks here and then further inside of

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:38,059
that block and we didn't give it any

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,799
filename it's going to assume oh you

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:42,229
want index since that's the main one so

00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,549
this is what was actually loaded up all

00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:45,709
right so that was it for just like how I

00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:48,229
would recommend customizing this tool

00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:49,940
right here so from here on out we'll get

00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:52,999
into the good stuff how to actually

00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,249
build this stuff so two commands who you

00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,779
need to be aware of one we already are

00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:58,549
running right now it's a ten pm start

00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,889
one that's one just listens for changes

00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:02,389
and rebuilds the plug-in there's a

00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:04,219
slightly different one though NPM run

00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:06,229
build and that's to build up heard of

00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:08,809
the production code so I think that just

00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:10,399
like minifides it and does a few things

00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:12,379
that you would want for production but

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,609
not necessarily want for development so

00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:14,719
those are the two commands to be with

00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,940
right now we're just running the first

00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:19,579
one all right

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,549
so the naming convention I recommend if

00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:24,440
you're going to use this this tool to

00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:26,539
scaffold out like a new a new plugin you

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,769
create a new block this is a come up

00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,569
with for like a good naming convention

00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:31,759
here so we are talking about index that

00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:33,349
j/s that's the only file that's required

00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,139
since that's where the block is is

00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:37,699
actually registered WordPress can work

00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:39,649
with it beyond that though you can have

00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:42,229
any of these others that are needed so I

00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:44,899
recommend doing like editor SCS a CSS

00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:47,569
for styles for the backend only icon

00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:49,159
duck j/s if it has an SVG icon if you

00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:50,719
remember one of our requests from the

00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,259
client said they did have a custom icon

00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:55,879
so we'll need to do that render that PHP

00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:59,089
if this is a dynamic function that we

00:28:55,879 --> 00:29:00,529
need to render every time to be to be

00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:03,019
different like our second block we'll

00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:04,879
build we need some kind of PHP file that

00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:07,299
has a callback function whenever this

00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:09,139
block is output this is what determines

00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,269
what gets rendered on the page

00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:14,149
and lastly styled that CSS tiles for the

00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:15,499
front-end back-end so all these are like

00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:18,079
how it's done in the core Guttenberg

00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:19,909
playing except rendered a PHP they do a

00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,229
different way but for our purposes like

00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:23,629
I think this is a good naming convention

00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:26,059
so let's stick with that alright so how

00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:27,859
to create a static block and so before

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:31,849
we move on to this let's just take one

00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:32,930
look at that example plug-in that ships

00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:35,420
with this so if you

00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,860
call like blocks you know we create that

00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,780
directory and we move this example block

00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,870
that comes with create block there let's

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,520
take a quick look at that

00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:48,950
so do have all the correct things

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,550
activated finally no yeah yeah I think I

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:54,980
do okay

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:58,390
and we will rename our function here

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,390
just make it more clear that will do

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,740
yep I give it a better name so it's a

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,810
little more recognizable but we should

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,870
to go be good to go with our with our

00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:24,230
box here alright so I'll go to posts and

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:29,750
then add noon we'll take a look so about

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:32,410
that example block hangin champion

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,410
install

00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,800
come on so good Berg that active and I'm

00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,930
getting the error message at the top so

00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,620
let me fix that real quick because we'll

00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,620
need that to proceed

00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:32,370
rise to whatever I've already NPO

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,110
installed I want you to build it it's

00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:41,510
working earlier today for us nuts

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:41,510
decided this out yes Dan

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:59,309
well I'll tell you what we'll do we're

00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:06,730
gonna get rid of coot

00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:09,510
you can't get idea here all right bear

00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,510
with me one sec sorry

00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,700
try to grab the river wordpress.org

00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,660
instead this is the one I said won't

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,730
have all those bundled blocks inside of

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,840
source so I wouldn't reference this but

00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:42,280
we'll see if we can use it just for now

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,870
to get this working all right

00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:50,800
that's looking good now what if I go to

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:53,200
posts and new alright we're in business

00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,760
so with that might the quote gutenberg

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,320
plugin i had wasn't building for some

00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,120
reason so i just grabbed another copy of

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,700
it alright so we'll keep rolling here

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:06,190
will say example blah blah all right and

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,390
from here so you're probably familiar

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,770
with this if you've messed around with

00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,540
gutenberg at all right this is just the

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,680
chooser where you can search for and

00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,780
click on like whatever block you're

00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:18,070
interested in so we'll take a look at

00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:19,270
this one see this cgb block right here

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,100
this is the example one that comes with

00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:23,050
this create gutten block tool so click

00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,500
on that you can see right here i get

00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:28,480
this green background div right here it

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,160
says hello from the back end i'll click

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,450
publish on that we'll take a look on the

00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,450
front end to see what this looks like

00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:44,080
and then you see see if it has been

00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:45,030
draft publish yeah okay there we go so

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,870
now it's published

00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,310
so the front end you'll notice it's

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,640
different right now it's red it says

00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:53,800
hello from the front end so look at you

00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,950
know what controls those blocks

00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,420
I'm just has one basic example alright

00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,040
so we'll take a look at this pre-built

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,130
block right here before I do anything

00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,510
else so here it is the block that comes

00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,310
with this let's look at the index.jsp

00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,260
Wow this is one I said it's like the

00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:10,570
main file the only one it's required to

00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,850
tell WordPress here's a new block this

00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,910
is what it looks like here so you see in

00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:17,620
this block the author is you know

00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:19,570
importing the other style sheets right

00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,100
here it's a style and editor this is all

00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,020
you have to do web pack does all the

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,370
rest it knows you know what to do with

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,170
each of those files and where to put

00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,810
them which to ask you to include them in

00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:30,300
a few is a single import statement if

00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:35,070
you have any that you want to include

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,070
alright next we're grabbing some

00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:40,529
some things off of objects that we need

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,940
on the global WP object but I mentioned

00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:43,889
that in his talks on this case we need

00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,809
this underscore underscore bringing

00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,029
translations what we'll do and we need

00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:50,760
to register block type function to do

00:34:48,029 --> 00:34:52,950
just that to register a block all right

00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,359
and then here's that example block the

00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,190
one we were just looking at here this is

00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:59,430
how it works kind of behind the scenes

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:01,710
here see if you give it a title so this

00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:06,990
one this is the current title we can get

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:09,000
a new new example block I don't know

00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:12,329
it'll appear appear as that in the admin

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,339
for the icon you can use one of the dash

00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:16,980
icons if you follow this link all you

00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:18,900
need to do is just provide the slug for

00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,549
that or alternatively you can give it an

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,880
SVG we'll see how to do that in a little

00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:23,760
bit

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,589
category determines where it shows up in

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,410
the admin so when I go here to add a new

00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:32,549
block see how they're suggested blocks

00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:35,730
embeds shared and so on blocks is just

00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:37,049
like the common area here CSS common so

00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,000
that just controls where you want this

00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:40,769
block to show up in that chooser so in

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,480
this case we've chosen common keywords

00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:45,450
here are other things you can search for

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,000
if anybody searched for this or this or

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,799
this or whatever in that chooser our

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,480
block would pop up those are the things

00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:52,440
that might be named so all those are

00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,009
pretty straightforward

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,930
next we'll get into the two functional

00:35:56,009 --> 00:36:02,160
components that actually powered this

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:03,720
black so the first one is edit it says

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,640
this edit function describes the

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,680
structure of your block in the context

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,490
of the editor meaning the WordPress

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,410
admin alright so you see what's

00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:18,119
happening here it receives this argument

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:20,220
called props and then on that object it

00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,480
has something called class name there's

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,910
something Gutenberg gives you right

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,039
after that you can pass in other props

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,869
if you want but we're after that gives

00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,240
you a few of them one is the class name

00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:32,069
for the current block so this container

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,269
div with that we're saying hello from

00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:37,259
the backend and just a link here so this

00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:40,230
is what you can think of this function

00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:42,359
as defining what's going to get rendered

00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,910
in the WordPress admin what the editor

00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:47,220
is going to see here if we go down to

00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,240
the next one though this save function

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,830
here you can think of this one

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,870
as what's going to be rendered on the

00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,940
front end of the site publicly for

00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:56,070
people people to actually see this is

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,740
also what gets saved in the in the

00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:01,860
WordPress database so the process is

00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,930
whatever is defined in the save function

00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,610
here when somebody like configures their

00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,290
block and then hits publish you know or

00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,450
they save that what WordPress will do is

00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:12,360
it'll take everything in this save

00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,580
function and it'll it'll save that to

00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,970
the database inside of the post content

00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,470
for this particular post then when this

00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,600
post gets rather on the front end of the

00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,010
site all that markup is there in the

00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,990
database so that's what will appear on

00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,460
the front of the site so for this

00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,260
function that's it's all about and

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,090
there's just it in the style sheets it

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,860
just defines that you know one of these

00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,060
should be read the other should be green

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,070
so you can kind of see the difference

00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,320
for like one one one is showing up and

00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,730
the other isn't this block is pretty

00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,890
darn simple and it doesn't have any

00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,360
attributes so usually right here after

00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,760
keywords you would specify the

00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,680
attributes and we'll see what that's all

00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,420
about next but I mentioned attributes

00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,920
what those are used for but since this

00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,290
block is so simple and has like zero

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,590
nothing to configure it doesn't actually

00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:58,110
need any attributes alright so that's it

00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,460
for the example block it's a good a good

00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,660
kind of starting point to get a feel for

00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,860
these let's create a new one though so

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,810
we'll dive into creating our static

00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,490
block so this is that call to action we

00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,440
talked about remember super cool client

00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,450
asks us to to create that one so we'll

00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,220
do first is inside of our blocks folder

00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:18,390
we'll create a new folder for our block

00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,130
and then we'll give it an index J's file

00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,750
to you let's get start with that so

00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,880
inside of blocks here I'll call it our

00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,480
example one and we'll create a new one a

00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:31,010
new folder we'll call it

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,010
routes and Det

00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,820
remember what I named it my finished

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,359
example okay and then inside of that

00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,970
will do a new index J s file alright and

00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:55,820
you get started here I have a little

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:57,020
boilerplate code that we'll use so don't

00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,480
waste too much time typing this stuff

00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,579
out alright so what I've what I've typed

00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,619
in here is just pretty bare-bones

00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:05,480
it just calls in those two things we

00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:07,970
mentioned for translations and then for

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,560
registering the block type as these

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,690
fields what they're all pretty you know

00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,880
critic as you can see and then an edit a

00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,280
save function and all it does for us is

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,930
give us that container div with the

00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,109
class name that's it it's up to us to

00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:23,420
fill in the rest here all right so what

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:25,160
should the first step be then if we if

00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,680
you want to create this block I think we

00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,970
should give it register and give it a

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,619
name you know fill out this section

00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,089
first and the old that I've been talking

00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:36,470
talking about the rest of the stuff

00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:39,290
there so give me just a second I'll find

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:48,020
my artist called it call to action and

00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:49,849
my let's rename it so it matches my

00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:56,359
final final example here okay so the

00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:57,740
call to action is there and then alright

00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:59,750
here's the finished version here so it

00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,950
will do first is I'll see all these

00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:05,300
things just Soviet you don't have to

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:07,339
watch me retype all of them there we go

00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,990
so yeah our namespace here as what I

00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:11,869
mentioned to group the other blocks is

00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:14,119
WC Det the block in particular is called

00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:16,130
call to action giving it giving it a

00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,560
name giving it one of those - icons so

00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,300
it'll be like a megaphone icon I'm

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,770
saying it's just a common type of block

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,930
so that's where it'll appear in the

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,310
admin and then the other key words like

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,950
other things I might I think people

00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,690
might search for I just had CTA right

00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,550
you could choose some other ones if you

00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,569
want there so I've completed all that

00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:38,050
now I can get into the edit and say

00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:40,520
functionality as well as the attributes

00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:42,560
let's start with attributes I think that

00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,310
might might be a good one so we'll start

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:49,190
with just the message first I think

00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,780
maybe you'll be good to go back to

00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,220
whether blocking shall it correct so

00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,020
I'll start with this right here this

00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,640
little rich text area so I'm calling the

00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,260
message will start with how to Bill

00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,900
that first and they'll move on to the

00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,690
image and the URL ones as well all right

00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:05,990
so first we need this attributes object

00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:08,210
and then we need this messages object

00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,540
inside of it so I'll put that in our new

00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:15,380
block that we're building over here I'll

00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:17,360
put that brick below keywords all right

00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,280
and then any my closing brace so here we

00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,990
are we've we're telling WordPress here

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,370
are our attributes we're gonna have one

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,290
called message this could have been

00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:27,980
named anything for choosing to name it

00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:29,060
message and then this type source and

00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,040
selector are some of the things that

00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,780
bind went over earlier some of these are

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,920
kind of hard to understand at first but

00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,480
the more you work with that you do get

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,860
familiar with it what we're saying here

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,270
is let me back up a second here

00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,520
well WordPress has to do in the

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,440
WordPress admin if somebody is running

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,110
Gutenberg what it has to do in order to

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,480
get things ready for for them to start

00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,370
editing is it has to grab the markup

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,630
from the database and pull some data out

00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:57,980
of it so what what happens is this save

00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:01,040
functionality function right here if

00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:03,380
let's say we have some a rich text area

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,020
up down there like we had a few

00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:08,300
paragraph tags that exists in there well

00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,240
WordPress will do when this when the

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:13,700
WordPress admin first loads up it will

00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,410
grab this the mark-up right here from

00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,420
the database it'll try to pull out

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,880
certain things from that and I'll use

00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,830
that to populate our attributes so we're

00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,320
saying we're telling it here's where you

00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,790
should look to get those messages you

00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,130
should look in something that has a

00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,300
class of message all right this is

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,850
similar if you're used to writing CSS

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,020
this is similar to just CSS selectors so

00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,370
that would have been pound message if it

00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,820
was an ID or there you're telling

00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:39,590
WordPress look at that particular

00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,480
element and they were telling it the

00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,580
source the thing we want to capture our

00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,460
are its children select all those

00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:48,200
paragraph tags inside of that and then

00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,740
type has to be array because we're

00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,640
gathering more than one thing all right

00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,170
there are other types of other children

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,780
but we'll get to those for now for this

00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,570
this particular one the message this is

00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,270
what it what it would need to look like

00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:05,680
and their documentation for thank you

00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,680
for how to do that

00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:11,910
a lion as well

00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:11,910
okay

00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:22,150
alright our time's running thin so let's

00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:24,480
talk through I'm gonna paste in these

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:37,900
other ones and we'll talk through them

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:41,560
yes and then save alright so here's what

00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:47,800
I where I ended up with this particular

00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:54,760
particular block where you say oh thank

00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:57,190
you awesome thank you so here's what I

00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,480
ended up with this with this block the

00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,250
props that come into it

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,760
that I'm pulling off are these ones so

00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,260
class name the attributes all right here

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,300
WordPress will pass those in to you

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,070
there's this set attributes function it

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,240
gives you as well that does just that

00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,040
whatever you call that you're telling it

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,860
I want to set my attributes up here to

00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,300
something new based on some you know new

00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:20,190
data the user has entered whatever else

00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,190
it also gives you this is selected

00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,480
boolean to tell whether this current

00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,700
block is in focus or not you can choose

00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,140
the show things based on that then I'm

00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,030
taking the attributes and pulling even

00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,470
more things out of that all right if

00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:35,260
this syntax looks a little funny just

00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:37,240
like es6 so I would you know just read

00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,130
up on on writing that but just know that

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,600
out of this attributes object we're

00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:44,470
pulling out these three things there's

00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,430
an image ID image URL and image alt so

00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,320
that would be in our call to action

00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:54,970
block that would be this top image right

00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:56,950
here alright and then let's see let's go

00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:58,600
to the render function here or the

00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,950
return function this is what that what

00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,360
actually should be shown in the

00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,640
WordPress admin here so here's our

00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,860
wrapper you know class name in the

00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:09,670
container right here and then we're

00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:12,100
saying if there is an image if there's

00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,500
no image ID if the user hasn't chosen

00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,700
that and again I'm skipping ahead so

00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,860
this would be assumed at this point

00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,470
we've we've already included the

00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:22,690
attributes for for the image if that has

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:27,270
not been chosen then we're gonna show

00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,270
this so there's this media upload

00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,870
component that that Gutenberg has inside

00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:36,590
of it the core plugin they're saying

00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:37,820
whenever that's selected whenever an

00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:39,020
image is selected we're going to call

00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,290
this function right here that will

00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,900
update our attributes we give it a type

00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:47,330
and the value is whatever whatever the

00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,040
ID is that was chosen for the last but

00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,540
I'm an image was chosen that's we're

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,490
gonna pass in for the value right here

00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,460
so I'll get up updated at any time

00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:57,110
there's a new value and then this render

00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,850
you just look into media upload it kind

00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,410
of see like how that how to pass things

00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:06,020
into it but just know that this is the

00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:09,020
standard way to select an image let me

00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:11,060
paste in all this stuff alright so if

00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,430
there's no image has been selected we're

00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,560
gonna show this media upload button

00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,690
right here on the other hand if an image

00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,640
has been chosen so we're gonna show that

00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:22,010
image at the top right here here's my

00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,130
image tag and I'm pulling in the URL for

00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:26,990
the chosen image the alt text and so on

00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:29,960
we're going to say if the current block

00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,880
is selected then we want to go ahead and

00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,650
show this button that says remove image

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,480
so if somebody clicks on the block and

00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,700
there's already an image there we'll get

00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,870
a button that says remove image so if

00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,020
they click that they'll be able to

00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:43,520
remove it we'll get out of a rich text

00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,540
field is what we started to build them

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,730
and there they go

00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:49,280
before jumped at it says you know and

00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,840
their contact action message here you

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,020
can see the value we're saying out of

00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,970
that attributes object pull out the the

00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,880
message from that and that's going to be

00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,560
the value of this rich text thing if the

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,750
user ever changes that if they type in a

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,150
new message then we're calling that set

00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,740
attributes function that you can revise

00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,040
to us and you're sending it the new

00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:12,110
message so it will it will update the

00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,290
attributes and if you're familiar at all

00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:17,120
with react it handles all the rear-end

00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,430
ring of things for you all you have to

00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,230
do is make sure like be the attributes

00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:23,870
up there are in the state you want them

00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:26,990
in if that makes sense so at any point

00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:30,620
you can just if something is updated in

00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:32,600
the attributes react will call like this

00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,130
edit function right here or real and

00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,810
everything in there so anything that

00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:38,930
like was true before but now isn't

00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:39,980
anymore it'll change that to you know

00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,440
either show or not

00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:45,350
whatever you told it to do it'll handle

00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,180
all of that logic if you're used to like

00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,890
writing jQuery for instance an order

00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:51,200
press context this is kind of a

00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,760
departure from that this is like writing

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,760
things more in more of a declarative way

00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,430
so you just tell react hey if at any

00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,260
point this block is selected when it

00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,510
when it renders just by all this stuff

00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:05,330
or if at any point there isn't an image

00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:07,490
display this thing right and then you

00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:10,850
you all you have to do is make sure that

00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:12,080
you are updating the image or the rich

00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:14,330
text or whatever it is those attributes

00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,040
just up to update them when they should

00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:17,510
be updated like when the user enters a

00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,820
new value there's long as you've done

00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,920
that it will it will run through this

00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,800
and handle you know displaying the right

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,850
thing on the screen at any given time

00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,040
all right so if it's selected we're

00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:31,369
gonna show this inspector controls thing

00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:34,430
in the side bar that says you can enter

00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:38,510
a call-to-action URL so if you it just

00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:42,040
looks like I'll save that I'll say that

00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:44,090
really quick and we have to include it

00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,810
all right so here's call-to-action

00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,810
here's our index

00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,250
this is heck here

00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,430
I'll carry through it

00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,990
okay

00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,740
Oh

00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:44,359
you also travel to live demos I'll say

00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:55,380
I thought I just moved my fish block

00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,380
there again

00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,190
all right

00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:18,210
alright help the secular so here's a new

00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,160
post I'll add a new one so here's that

00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,210
call to action if you're interested it's

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,560
all said then this oh it looks like

00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,720
there was our megaphone there's our

00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,170
title we gave it so you click on that

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,030
this is what it looks like so you can

00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:35,820
click or click you know here another

00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:41,550
call to action message let me see I had

00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:44,850
that save here field values you know

00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:48,450
grab all this that'd be our message for

00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:54,090
our upload image will grab the logo and

00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:56,420
then to the URL here we'll link to this

00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,420
event

00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,640
alright so that was member of netcode I

00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:05,220
said everything I was rendering here

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,900
like the image the remove button or

00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,119
whatever else but there was one sections

00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,309
that inspector controls what that does

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,470
is gutenberg any any fields you put

00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:15,599
inside its controlled it puts over here

00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,339
inside of this this side panel right

00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,809
here so this URL I thought would be a

00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:20,910
good spot for that right since there's

00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:22,589
not really like a annexed natural place

00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:24,839
for it to go here so the user would just

00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:26,480
like paste in their URL right here so if

00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:28,589
they do all that and they hit publish

00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:34,859
then we can go ahead and do this on the

00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:36,319
front end and it looks like that so this

00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:38,400
background right here is just hard coded

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,140
so you could you know have yet another

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,849
image upload field for them to choose

00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,859
the background if you wanted in addition

00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,930
to the foreground image tomatoes make it

00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:48,500
easy I just left that out but here's

00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:50,490
that you know rich text that we had

00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,900
typed in right here and if you hover

00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,539
over you can see it it's linking to the

00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:59,329
right to the right place right so this

00:51:54,539 --> 00:52:02,369
is our static block right here and then

00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:03,599
our save function is more more

00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,859
simplified as you can see because we

00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,630
don't need all those fields for like

00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:09,210
adding them image we're moving the image

00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:10,349
the inspector controls all that stuff we

00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,940
already a that so you can see it's a

00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:13,309
little bit thinner here so this would

00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,480
actually get saved to the database

00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:17,910
WordPress will say it'll wrap everything

00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,410
and it did first of all within in that

00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:21,809
link alright so we have the whole thing

00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:24,269
ends up getting linked we have our image

00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:26,309
at the top and a message at the bottom

00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:29,519
here and these values that it plugs in

00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:31,349
like the URL the alt text the message

00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:34,349
wherever else those ultimately come from

00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:38,059
those attributes alright so in your code

00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:40,890
if you again you can think of it as when

00:52:38,059 --> 00:52:42,809
when we press like loads this block up

00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:44,430
for somebody to edit it it's taking bit

00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:46,259
all this stuff from the database and

00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:48,809
it's pulling the attributes out of that

00:52:46,259 --> 00:52:52,470
so what it'll do it'll look for this

00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:54,450
class name say the class name image

00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:56,339
right here it looked for the dot image

00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:58,410
selector if you told it to do so and

00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,269
it'll pull out the source attribute here

00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,069
and the alt attribute you know grab

00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:04,019
those values and put those into the

00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:05,609
attributes and then it will only change

00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:06,029
them if the user sets them to something

00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:08,250
else

00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:11,190
likewise it'll look for the message

00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,550
class and it'll pull out the children of

00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,170
that

00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:16,170
that was only set to children's it can

00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:18,480
be like multiple paragraphs so if you

00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:20,070
look at attributes right here it

00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,770
corresponds with that so here's message

00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:25,020
right you talion look in this class for

00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:28,980
the children and it's an array of those

00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:30,720
children for the link URL look in the

00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,550
dot link that we just saw a minute ago

00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,980
the attributed source that we're looking

00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:36,600
for and it's one of its attributes so

00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:38,640
that's what's going to pull out and put

00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,700
into link URL and again it's up to you

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:45,030
to just update these whenever necessary

00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:47,640
using that set attributes function like

00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:49,080
this right so when anybody change is

00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,080
this field we're saying take the new

00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,580
message and call set attributes and pass

00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,710
in that new message so that gets updated

00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,420
then all right cool

00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:59,430
so we're out of time we did one out of

00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,630
my queue blocks I'm so I apologize for

00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:06,480
that if you're curious about the other

00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:08,460
one though I can I can show you that

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,080
real real briefly so here's here's the

00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,930
first one and then the second one was

00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,100
going to be or can't be taught latest

00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,290
posts none of the client wanted a

00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,070
special icon so here's the icon that

00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:19,530
we've included here

00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:21,750
that's another file it's just icon J s

00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:23,220
right there if you choose that cuz it

00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:25,410
looks like you get a list of the posts

00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,210
and these you know recognize here that's

00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:29,130
not from this site this site is weird

00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:31,260
camp Detroit test it's pulling in the

00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,060
actual actual posts from the word Camp

00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,560
Detroit site and then displaying them

00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,400
here usually gets this little

00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,490
rangecontrol

00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,620
slash this on the fly you can change the

00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:43,470
number you can see in between there's a

00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,090
little X fetching word for a moment

00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:47,430
momentarily while it grabs those posts

00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:48,990
and then pops them into view so they can

00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:50,100
like dial this into like the number of

00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,870
posts if they're interested in get a

00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,850
live preview of what this really will

00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:57,600
look like right here and then when they

00:54:53,850 --> 00:55:01,200
hit update they can view this post on

00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,970
the front end and here those list of

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,610
posts right here they would link out to

00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,740
the word camp Detroit site right that

00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:09,030
one if you have more time you can look

00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,010
look at the github repo to see how

00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:13,050
that's done that one because you can't

00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,970
you can imagine for this this block

00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:16,740
because it can look different every time

00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,270
it's loaded up right that's so this is

00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,400
it something we can save to the database

00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:23,940
so we had to do in that what we have to

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,690
you in that case is so in index J s

00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:30,420
remember I said the

00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:32,250
the Edit functionality right here this

00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,470
one's more complex because it has

00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,600
internal internal state so you look at

00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:40,290
this later if you want but inside the

00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:42,350
Edit component here we're doing a lot of

00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:46,080
stuff but look at the save component

00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:48,180
there isn't one we're passing null right

00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,980
here and the reason is this is the this

00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,200
is the markup is safe to Davis brach in

00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,570
our case there's none here all we're

00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:59,550
doing is saying saving one single thing

00:55:54,570 --> 00:56:02,490
to the attributes which is number of

00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:03,660
posts and the type is number that's it

00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,300
so if you looked in the database you'd

00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:08,340
see one single little inline comment for

00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,050
this block that you said the user picked

00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,490
a number of posts and it was six

00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,500
that's all it knows it doesn't know

00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:17,310
anything else and then it's up to us to

00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:19,440
define a callback in PHP then so what

00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:22,320
you can do in PHP is say hey for the

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,610
latest posts its render a callback

00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,380
function that you should use whenever

00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:27,480
it's being output on the page is this

00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:30,300
thing it's called render latest post

00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,680
block and that's this function here all

00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,410
right so it will try to get the number

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,120
of posts I have this fetch latest post

00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:38,520
function here which will what try to

00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,650
fetch them if you're interested in that

00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,560
used if you promote get you like reach

00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:46,020
out to the word campsite and retrieve

00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,850
those posts back and then it does JSON

00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,590
decode on them to turn them into

00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:53,190
something the PHP can easily work with

00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:55,260
if that was successful then if we were

00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,980
able to get those posts that array of

00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,190
posts right here

00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:00,690
then we're outputting this markup right

00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:03,750
here so it's saying for each of those

00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:05,280
posts that we grabbed as post it's

00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,380
outputting a paragraph and then an

00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,980
anchor tag inside with that posts link

00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:13,560
and then that posts title inside of the

00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,780
link so that's what ultimately results

00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:18,800
in in this right here so if I were to

00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,800
update this and say

00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:29,030
hello say no and I reload this you can

00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,710
see that showing up every time so that's

00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:33,260
the benefit of having this book that

00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:34,940
callback method in PHP is you can have

00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,980
this look different on every page load

00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,330
if that's ever necessary for you it was

00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,880
not though you can go ahead and use that

00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,860
save function and save to save things to

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,540
the database if you don't need this you

00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,040
know dynamic function out here alright

00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,380
I'm a little over time so I think that

00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,970
was about it there's a ton to cover with

00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:52,340
Gutenberg but hopefully it from that you

00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:54,200
at least got a sense of like what tool

00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:56,240
might be a good one to look at for that

00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,100
plugin that helps you like scaffold out

00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,780
your first block and the difference

00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,850
between a static one like that

00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,320
call-to-action one we chose you know

00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:05,030
where there are few options to customize

00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,190
and then we're saving that to the

00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:08,780
database for WordPress to pull those

00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:10,940
attributes out and then resave then all

00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:14,360
that difference between that and a

00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:16,760
dynamic one like the one we showed here

00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:19,130
right where it gets a render callback is

00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:22,160
in PHP instead and it can pull in

00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:24,200
different things every time it gets run

00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,670
of like that so hopefully I was helpful

00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,530
to you there's lots of resources

00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:29,600
especially in Brian's slides you have a

00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:31,280
lot of helpful resources that you can

00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,020
check out it's going to dive into the

00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,340
stuff yourself so thank you so much for

00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,340
