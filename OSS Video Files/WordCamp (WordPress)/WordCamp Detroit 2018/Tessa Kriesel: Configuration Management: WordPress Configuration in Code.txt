Title: Tessa Kriesel: Configuration Management: WordPress Configuration in Code
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	Problem: You have a team of developers and you all work locally pushing up to one central development environment. Your client has been adding content to your live environment while your team is working away on other features. Your client decides they want to add calendar functionality to the site, which you can easily do with a plugin. However, configuring this plugin requires database changes. If you make any changes to your database, or even the development environment database, you are going to have to go make those changes again on the live site since they already have content in the site and you canâ€™t copy over that entire database.
UGH! There has got to be a better way! We have all been in this situation more than once. So how do we get out of this situation?!
Solution: Configuration Management! We will talk about what configuration management is and how you can start to use it in your current workflow. We will also talk about WordPress plugins that make our lives easier by using similar methodologies.

00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,059
the loving dog comment is actually an

00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,340
understatement I'm like obsessively in

00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,170
love with dogs so if you would like to

00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,520
talk about dogs that's like my niche

00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:21,529
where they where to get me so he did a

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,660
fabulous job of introducing me

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:25,610
so here's really just the same stuff he

00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,079
said also lead organizer for Kent

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,480
Minneapolis this year which is really

00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,399
exciting and it's coming together quite

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,110
well so if you have a desire to come to

00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,300
Minneapolis that that's taking place in

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,800
August same weekend as the opening state

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,810
fair so also another reason to come so

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,610
if you want to reach out to me I would

00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,410
love for you shared on social obviously

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,510
it helps the camp it also helps me it

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,040
also helps other people see the content

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,290
feel free to do so

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,020
Tessa K 22 is my handle pretty much

00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:58,150
everywhere you can possibly find me and

00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:01,100
then use the official hashtag WCET

00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,780
so I want to talk through this scenario

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,299
a little bit and why this is important

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,890
and I'm sure a lot of you depending on

00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:08,960
how many of you are developers just

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,490
amazing okay perfect good that's your mo

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,500
you're the audience I need that will

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,470
understand this so a team of developers

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,640
is working that is already on a side

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,979
it's already live and they're adding

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,710
additional functionality so we've got

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,760
multiple developers working on this each

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,210
developer is working in their own

00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,320
feature branch all likely needing

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,670
database to make database changes right

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,290
we all know in WordPress a lot of things

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,580
they're controlled by the database but

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,380
there are a lot of things in code and

00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,960
kind of trying to manage all of that can

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,549
be difficult so content from the live

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,890
environment needs to be tested against

00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,390
new features being created so we've got

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,340
lots of content that's living in live

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,710
that client is continuing to add content

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,700
edit content but we're still trying to

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,700
work with the database we have

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,780
[Applause]

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:03,450
and it needs to be it needs to be so

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,830
that it's not overridden so we're gonna

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,700
talk about and I'm gonna come back to

00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,590
this and I'm gonna give you some more

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,000
foundation but what we're gonna do is

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,610
we're gonna attack about these three

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,550
people they're fictional people Joe

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,489
Joanna and John are all going to work in

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,650
different places to do different tasks

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,180
that we need them to do so Joe is going

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,920
to actually edit some theme things he's

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,510
going to use the customizer customizer

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,010
actually saves all of that data into

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,530
your database

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,290
Joanna is going to edit our page cache

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,040
plug-in the site is coincidentally on

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,630
Pantheon which you know I wonder why but

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,920
and then John is going to set up a

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,170
MailChimp plug-in that they haven't been

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,610
using before and so all of these entail

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:47,400
code changes as well as database changes

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,860
so before we start digging into the demo

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,810
and Joe and John and Joanna and all the

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,780
code changes they're making let's talk

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,820
about some of the basics so what is site

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,920
configuration does anyone worked with

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,930
site configuration or configuration

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,820
management for okay cool so site

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,560
configuration really is the

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,780
configuration of your site so most of

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,700
that configuration can be found in the

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,200
WordPress settings so if you've ever

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,450
gone to the settings area you change

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,860
like the site name the the date format

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,810
the emmitt where the images are say like

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,829
all stuff like that that's all your

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,930
configuration of your site so site

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,810
configuration includes items that might

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,940
also be related to a plug-in so plugins

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,750
have settings correlated to them themes

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,940
might have settings that's probably

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,799
about it and all of that stuff is

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,480
configuration that you're actually

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:41,360
setting up in your website I just really

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,160
like this little like mean this is fun

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,480
configuration everywhere right so these

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,530
developers are going to be working on

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,900
these tasks they're also doing

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,980
configuration I don't remember which one

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,290
but one of them has to set up a

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,910
MailChimp plug-in and there's an API key

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,230
that needs to go along with that mail

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,489
chip plug-in and so that's a

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,930
configurable item so we've got

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,319
configuration we know that we're

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,749
constantly doing it we're adding

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,639
settings were changing things so what is

00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:07,870
configuration management has anyone ever

00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,430
worked with Drupal before that's in the

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,280
room now okay

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,590
so Drupal 8 specifically is doing a

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,840
fabulous job of configuration management

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,970
and it's built into core WordPress does

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,130
not have that so configuration

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,979
management is the act of managing your

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:27,070
site configuration in code through

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,630
version control so basically the things

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,970
that we are doing to configure that

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,740
MailChimp plugin we convert that to

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,660
something that's in code so that we can

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,669
move that code from one environment to

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,139
the other so if we've got three

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,849
developers working on something at the

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,310
same time if they're pushing that all to

00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,410
a code file we can easily grab that

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,729
because it's all in code and it's in our

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:54,759
git repository do we have enough

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:56,470
configuration management probably not so

00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,530
there's the awesome plugin that is

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,190
called WP CFM it is actually slightly

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,830
outdated

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,570
however functionality in WordPress has

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,729
not changed to require an update for

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,150
that plug-in it's built by the awesome

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:13,419
folks over at forum one I personally

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,620
have a lot of I love the plug-in I think

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,720
it's awesome that's why I'm talking to

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,669
you about it and there's been

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,620
initiatives around updating this plug-in

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,120
and contributing so if you start to use

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,250
this and you realize that this is

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,680
amazing just like I did they're

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,759
definitely looking for people and

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,919
contributors to really help maintain

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,330
this plug-in currently like I said a lot

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,220
of functionality hasn't changed but with

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,389
Guttenberg coming out there may be some

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,389
changes to some of the way that the

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,409
settings could possibly be saved and

00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:43,930
there might be some opportunity to

00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:47,380
expand on it all right so the perks of

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,509
WP CFM are that there is the less need

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,460
to copy the database so we talked about

00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:53,169
these hypothetical developers they're

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,680
all working in different environments if

00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,389
we can do their changes in code instead

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,310
of in the database we don't have to try

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,349
to figure out how to merge databases

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,960
together and how to make all of those

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,400
changes work or overwrite any type of

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,830
database situation with what they're

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,330
doing there's no need to manually apply

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,010
a database settings or changes like I

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,840
just said it's obviously all in code so

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,770
we can use utilize that code to move it

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,210
around

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,010
and then we can track in migrate

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,990
configuration files so the nice thing

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,330
about this is if one person does a

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,830
change and another person does a change

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,980
there's a version control to that like

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,330
we we all are probably who is everyone

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,670
familiar with version control before I

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,890
just make assumptions okay awesome

00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,300
so we know that version control allows

00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,340
us to have a history to the things that

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,290
we do so if someone does some type of

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,520
configuration and they break something

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,800
or maybe they do something that's not

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,900
right we can track back to like what

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,750
happened who did that like when was this

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,130
done we can reverse it all of that

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,960
information that we may want to know

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:54,430
about things that were actually putting

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,030
in our database technically so what can

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,040
it track

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,290
I wish it could track everything because

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,300
that would be amazing but it can only

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,000
track the things that are in the wp

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,920
options table so in the options table

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,560
they will store things like the general

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,150
core settings it will also store things

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,880
like the customizer like I'd mentioned

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,130
earlier plug-in settings so as long as

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,050
the plug-in is built in a way that the

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,570
settings that you enter are stored in

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,090
the WP options table which most of them

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,790
are if they're built correctly and those

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,400
plug-in settings will come along let's

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,550
see I think that's that's probably about

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,370
it for like deep default theme some

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:38,440
plugins it will also do categories and

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,300
tags I believe as well so there's some

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,530
terminology to this plug-in so once you

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,360
install it you decide that you want to

00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,000
use it it's actually pretty easy to

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,220
figure out but some of the terminology

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,950
behind that is a bundle a bundle is a

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,720
group of settings so you can essentially

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,940
go in there and say I want to create a

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,830
bundle and maybe you put all of your

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,810
theme settings inside of one bundle

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,780
which is really just like customizer and

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,430
other customizer fields and then maybe

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,930
you say okay cool I know that I'm

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,370
working on this MailChimp plug-in I'm

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,140
gonna create a bundle for my MailChimp

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,090
plug-in so that someone else who is

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,280
working on another site can just pull in

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,660
those configurations and then only

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,340
things that you check off for that

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,590
bundle will actually get put in there

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,330
for MailChimp so I get to a very

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,610
granular level when I'm doing it because

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,040
I like to have well a unlike slightly

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,660
OCD I'm pretty sure but be I like to

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,190
have things like very organized and

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,350
clean so I know that if I'm pull

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,340
in a bundle if it's a new change or if

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,750
it's a change from another developer

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,130
that I don't have to pull everything in

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,960
and I can specifically pull in what I

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:40,390
actually need so pushing is the act of

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,940
exporting your configuration to a JSON

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,320
file so you do some changes you create

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,060
your bundle you check the things that

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,590
you want in that bundle and then you

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,180
push it and what that does is it pushes

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,680
it to your server or your version

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,210
wherever it is that you're working if

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,710
you're working locally it's going to

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,270
create that file and then you'll have

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,940
that in your version control to be able

00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,190
to commit and then pulling is the

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,960
opposite so pulling is you go into a new

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,820
environment and you see that there are

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,590
JSON files you go in there you can see

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,170
all of the bundles that are in your in

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,820
your site files and then you can pull in

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,710
any of those bundles and then when you

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,480
pull it in it'll basically say okay cool

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,770
do you want to make these changes to the

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,150
database and then you're like yes I do

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,500
and then it'll pull in all of those

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,090
settings from your bundle of questions

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,770
it is not the get push and pull so these

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,120
are words that are inside of the I'm

00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,440
actually going to do a demo in a second

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,010
but they're actual buttons that are

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,010
inside of the plug-in but it's actually

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,570
like similar to get push and pull

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,580
obviously you're you know pushing files

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,850
and then pulling them in but they're not

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,850
the same

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,340
yeah yep so it's writing it to a JSON

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,230
file technically and then all of that is

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,840
in there and then the buttons are in the

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,850
dashboard for you to push in pull so

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,250
coming back to Joe Joanna and John we're

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:58,300
actually gonna do a live demo because

00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,220
those never go wrong of course so we'll

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,690
see how it goes but okay so what I've

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,180
done is that if you're not familiar with

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,710
Pantheon Pantheon has like this really

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,910
nice environment set up we've got a dev

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,830
test in live and you can move stuff

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,300
around but I we also have this thing

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,830
called a multi dev which I can pull

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,690
things into like essentially what would

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,820
be considered like feature branches and

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,740
so each one of these developers has

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,440
their own environment to be able to work

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,930
with and make changes so right now we're

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,030
in let's see I think we're in Joe's I

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,290
have to remember I made all these fake

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,540
people and then I forgot who was

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,880
supposed to do what okay so Joe is

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,040
supposed to be working on a theme so we

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,720
just have the 2017 theme installed I'm

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,700
just gonna pop over to the customizer

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,020
here and make like a quick change just

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,250
so we have something different that we

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,910
want to push around so let's just change

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,910
this to

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:51,140
Joe is fancy website you can go ahead

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,110
and push that or publish that so when we

00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,210
publish that that actually created a

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,430
change to the customizer so in the

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,970
database this what I put in there has

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,980
now been pushed over to to our database

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,240
and so now my database for Joe site is

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,810
going to be different than John's and

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:13,070
Joanna's at this point all right so we

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,600
made a change so to get into Dobby PC FM

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,980
we go to settings and then it shows up

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,680
at the bottom of our settings I know

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,850
this is probably slightly small you see

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,400
if I can like this bigger better cool so

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,540
we're in WP CFM and this is where those

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,190
buttons were coming into play a little

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,870
pushing in the pulling so I'm going to

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,880
create a new bundle Joe's job was to

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,330
change the site name in the customizer

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,240
so we can say this one bundle is gonna

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,100
be for theme and then the only downfall

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,320
to this plug-in is that everything is

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,410
like machine readable names so you have

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,570
to like decipher what those are so I

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,310
actually know that the name of the site

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,960
is called blog name in the database and

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,880
as you start to use this you'll pick up

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,500
on some of them and then one of like the

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,070
ending slides there are like cheat

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,540
sheets for which one maps to where so

00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,460
we're gonna do blog name in there and

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,310
then we'll just go ahead and save that

00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,130
so in this bundle we've got just the one

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,920
thing checked off and it's the blog name

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,930
so if I push this then what it just did

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,210
when I clicked pushes it created a JSON

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:17,150
file for me of the code change I just

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:20,000
made so if we go back to the panthÃ©on

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,740
dashboard for this site which is this

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,870
one we can see that there is now I'm

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,540
gonna zoom in again there's now a file

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,030
change that is pending and sit down here

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,790
it created a config directory and then

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,890
it put a theme JSON file inside of that

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,740
directory so if we click on that we can

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:39,260
actually see in JSON format what we

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,330
change the blog name to so now his

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,270
changes are inside of a JSON and someone

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,890
else can pull those and if they need to

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,480
so what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,950
so these are in multi devs so that means

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,720
that they're in like basically their own

00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,490
branch so I'm actually going to merge

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
this into our development which is

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,850
considered our master branch so the

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,480
other developers can later pick this up

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:02,029
because Joe is now done with his work

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:10,700
so go back to dev we can do a merge if

00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm in get mode anyways sorry this just

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,250
takes a second to get back in to get

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:20,899
mode alright cool

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,740
so Joe's changes are done my mouse is

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,690
being weird

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,990
all right so we're gonna merge Joe's

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:31,220
code into actually wait that's not gonna

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:33,339
work yet cuz I didn't commit it this is

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,089
what I live demos are not a great idea

00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,860
alright we'll come back to that one

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,510
actually let's go work on John's so John

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,170
is supposed to be doing

00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:45,470
MailChimp alright so I already installed

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,720
the no I didn't you guys I got my people

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,770
confused already

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,830
alright let's just look for a MailChimp

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,240
plug-in and add it the idea here is to

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:58,390
just get a bunch of changes you can see

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,390
what it looks like I think it's one word

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,720
cool

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,410
all right so we got a new plugin we're

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,000
gonna go ahead and activate it obviously

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,950
when we activate in the Clubman that

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,649
saving to our database the plug-in files

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,779
are part of our code so now if we go

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,720
back down to settings go to WP CFM again

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,950
we can create a bundle and now this time

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,200
we're not doing something that is

00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,970
actually a core feature so we have to

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,110
figure out like what database fields are

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:30,000
mapped to this plugin so if we open a CF

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,370
here again we can see all of these

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,779
different check boxes so again I've

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,579
gotten pretty familiar with what some of

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,160
these stand for but if you start to

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:40,920
scroll down and maybe even do like a

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,800
look at like the name this one is

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,140
actually called MailChimp for WP that's

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,670
what the plug-in name is called so as

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,260
you start to get familiar you'll get to

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,920
you'll start to realize like what these

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:58,470
are so if I check like all of the MC WP

00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:00,480
ones I think that's all of them cool now

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,940
I can go ahead and save that and then I

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,750
can push that bundle and then again if

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,519
we go over to John's environment this

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,040
time we can actually commit it so now

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,990
there's 254 changes a big chunk of that

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,680
obviously the plug-in but then we can

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:21,560
also scroll down don't do yeah maybe

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,920
it's up the way bottom nope way top

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,540
there we go

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,899
we can see that there is a JSON file

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,500
that is now basically grabbing the

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,720
configuration that is there by default

00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,940
however we want to change that

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,910
configuration because we just installed

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,130
it we haven't added our API key so if we

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,230
go in and go to plugins I go to

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,610
MailChimp

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:48,000
let's just put fake API can't type see

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,620
if it'll let us do that oh it says it

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,170
returned an error but it did save it so

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,240
let's see what happens if we go back so

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,860
to go back to settings and we're like

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,899
okay cool we've made a change we need to

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,329
push that change to our bundle so we go

00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,050
ahead push the change to our bundle we

00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:09,330
can go back to our environment for John

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:13,230
and there should be an update

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:17,910
see what happens here open our pending

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:20,339
files disappeared where'd it go

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,970
sorry there's like a list of all these

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:27,860
files I got to find it private back at

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,860
the top again here we go

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,490
so I didn't actually save up a Peggy so

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:40,220
I do need like a legitimate API key but

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:40,220
nonetheless like let's see

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,160
see if I can come up with one

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:57,120
nope it won't I mean so we'll just call

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,620
that good all right so we've got the

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,200
settings there that we can go ahead and

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:08,460
come in so mailchimp go and commit that

00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,330
and then if we go over to Joana she's

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,810
the last one

00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:15,030
Joana is working on the advance page

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,830
cache plugin so if we go in and we

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:22,260
actually install this sorry I'm like

00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:24,060
that bigger again we install the embed

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,520
speech cache plugin this is a plug-in

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,650
that works with Pantheon's like awesome

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,050
levels of caching and allows you to like

00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,570
configure that so she's gonna go in she

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,670
installed the plug-in so we can go back

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,530
and actually do her commit for

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:44,690
installing the plug-in it'll be easier

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:48,060
to see the files then stop cache plug-in

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,950
well if we go back to her site now if we

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,740
go to settings we can find the Pantheon

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,420
page cache plug-in and then we can just

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,400
change this to whatever we want so let's

00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,850
just say we want our our time to live

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,550
for our cache to be 1200 seconds we can

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,920
go ahead and update that and now if we

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:09,290
go to WP CFM we can create a new bundle

00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:13,590
again this time it's for the page cache

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:15,270
plug-in and then again figure out

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,340
exactly what this is called and I don't

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,610
remember off the top of my head what it

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,610
was called so let's try and figure it

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,190
out

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:28,800
Pantheon cache there we go so we check

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:32,190
that hit Save Changes

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,910
push it again pop back into our

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:38,310
environment cool so we see a file change

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,890
here created this file and we can see

00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,670
that at the time to live changed to 1200

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,670
seconds instead of the 600 all right

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,670
yeah

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,690
you definitely could so you could just

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,940
check all the boxes and say that you

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,470
want to create everything I I just I

00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,580
personally don't do that because then

00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,620
when you pull it in you're pulling

00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,880
everything in so if for some reason your

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,590
developer decided that they wanted to

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,690
tweak something just for their

00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,669
environment then you'd be pulling in all

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,789
of those changes too so I'm pretty

00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:10,049
particular about which ones I include

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:11,309
but you could it's all in version

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,380
control so you could go back and fix

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:14,880
things if you need to do all right

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,010
awesome so we've got everything and

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,309
everyone's different environment so

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:24,600
we've got to change wait hold up

00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:25,799
bundle or a page cache go ahead and

00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,270
commit that then I make sure everything

00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,669
else is committed and then we can merge

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,620
all of this into our master branch or we

00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,530
can pull all of this in which is what

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:41,340
makes it cool all right I think I came

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:43,409
into that one let's see this one does

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:48,870
not have a bundle for it see what

00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:53,010
happened Jose was the customizer he I

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,539
lost it all right so let's go back into

00:19:53,010 --> 00:20:00,950
Joe site and just make sure that those

00:19:54,539 --> 00:20:00,950
changes there there push this

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,139
I think it's bundled up to me David oh

00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:12,090
yeah I already merged okay so we're good

00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:17,610
so I'm going to merge the rest of these

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:20,570
in so Joanna's with the page cache yeah

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,570
I thought I did that

00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:28,549
sorry all develo Geist ik's

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,330
okay so we should be good now so now I

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,610
can merge in Joanna's so what it's doing

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,020
is is basically doing a git merge of the

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,910
file changes that we did which is going

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:45,910
to be our JSON files and the plug-in

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:50,400
files and then now we should be able to

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,400
do John's once this is done

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,110
all right so now we're gonna merge

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,730
John's in while that's actually merging

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,900
I'm gonna pop back over to my slides

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:07,600
because I want to make sure that there's

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:10,370
not anything else I wanted to share so

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,840
well that's merging essentially I have a

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,130
step by step so I already shared these

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,080
slides as long as buffer did its job

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,990
correctly on my Twitter account so you

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,370
can find the slides but these are the

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,080
steps to basically set it up and sell

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,620
the plug-in add a bundle put all the

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,750
things that I walked through just now

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,130
and then some tips and tricks so as you

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,390
saw I was like digging through those

00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,700
fields to figure out which fields

00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,220
correlated to like certain fields in the

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,049
database there are some tricks to do so

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,700
there's the options reference in the

00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,490
WordPress codex actually walks you

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,990
through all of the core fields and then

00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,330
you can also go to whatever your site

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,130
name is and go to like the WP admin

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,470
obviously and then go back slash options

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,059
dot PHP and you'll get to visually see

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,679
what all of the fields are in your

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,850
database so it'll show you like what you

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,140
have for site name and it'll show you

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,299
what you have for like something else

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,970
and sometimes that helps me figure out

00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,770
like exactly which one I want to see and

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,299
then like I had to here it create as

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,710
many bundles as you want create one huge

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:07,100
bundle it's entirely up to you on how

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,750
you want to do your workflow major

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,419
security consideration that I want to

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,630
point out before we get back to the demo

00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:16,970
this is put in the wp-content folder as

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,950
we all know is web accessible and so

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,960
it's going to create a config file or

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,520
folder directory basically and then

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,380
it'll put all your JSON x' in there if

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,510
you're putting things like API keys in

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,700
there like I was just trying to do make

00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,770
sure that you lock down that file from a

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,660
like a readable standpoint so that

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:36,080
others are not getting your Slyke secure

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,490
API keys and then you can also do some

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,270
configuration if you wanted to move

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:44,450
where that is located as well so WP CLI

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,010
if has anyone used every piece away you

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,049
know awesome you you all should because

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,940
it's amazing so it's a command-line tool

00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:51,770
for WordPress and it'll specifically do

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,600
tasks inside of your WordPress site for

00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,429
you through command line and there

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,720
actually are a lot of commands for it so

00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:59,270
you can do the pulling and the pushing

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,890
you can check the differences you can

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,510
look at your list of bundles the only

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,390
thing you can't do with command line is

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,830
actually create a new bundle obviously

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,840
that takes some intensity to check all

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,980
the boxes off but if you're trying to do

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,169
like a more automated script

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,880
if your wordpress prod like process you

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,049
could do things like pulling if you were

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,150
doing kind of like a project to

00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:20,870
deployment or whatever you can include

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,950
this into that automated deployment and

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,240
then cheat sheet so I'm not actually

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,799
gonna walk through all of the cheat

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,390
sheets because you don't need them but

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,090
if you want to use this you can use them

00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,650
in my slide deck so we only have like

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,860
five minutes left we're getting close to

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,260
five minutes so if we pop into my new

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,510
site now or my master branch essentially

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,799
all of our developers did their work and

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,260
then we went ahead and we merged all of

00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,809
that into master if I go into settings

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,240
actually I have to turn this on first

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,940
so activating it by going to settings

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,410
here go to WP CFM we can actually see

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,320
that two bundles I must have somehow

00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,549
screwed up the last bundle that happens

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,220
so what we can do now is we can either

00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:59,929
individually pull each bundle or we

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,360
could actually just pull all the bundles

00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:03,830
in so if I go ahead and do a pull here

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,419
it's going to say do you want to import

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,610
these settings to your database I'm

00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:10,340
gonna say yep I sure do

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,960
now if I were to go over to let's say

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,960
the page cache one came through so let's

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,360
check that out so if we go into the page

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,980
cache we can see that the 1200 seconds

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,040
carried over instead of the default of

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:28,299
600 seconds anyone have questions on

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,299
that SP it's like amazing

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:41,240
yeah totally yeah absolutely I'm only

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,530
using Pantheon because like they have

00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,480
this nice dashboard that's really easy

00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,910
to show you that I'm doing different

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,890
environments it is by no means like a

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,750
sales or selling point for Pantheon it

00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:54,050
is usable like everywhere you possibly

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,100
want to use it cool I'm gonna replay

00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,280
these and make sure I don't have any

00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,360
like ending slides but for the most part

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,800
these are all cheat sheets so it's

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,330
walking through like what it what it

00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,580
actually is in WordPress and what the

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:08,290
field is in the database for you to kind

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,290
of kick off your use with this plug-in

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,880
I'll be Oh let's see this so this other

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:20,140
one this last one I said here oops

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,140
keep doing too many buttons

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:26,140
nope we had to do that so there is also

00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,310
a way for you to customize this so if

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,930
you're a plug-in developer you can

00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:31,510
actually do some configuration of

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,710
creating your own fields for this so if

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,150
you're building out a plugin and maybe

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,760
you're not storing things in the options

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:39,280
table but you want to store things in a

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,720
WP CFM bundle there's actually a custom

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,890
way for you to go ahead and do that and

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,280
then you can find that all in their

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:47,170
documentation site helpful resources at

00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,000
Pantheon we like support anything that

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,320
makes your workflow easier which this

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,480
obviously does that so we've got a

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,400
couple Doc's that we've shared you can

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,470
also hit up forum one those are the

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,700
developers of the plugin and then some

00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,560
of the things I wanted to point out is

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,500
if how many of you use advanced custom

00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,450
fields ok quite a few has anyone like

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,920
set up the synchronize JSON see or like

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,080
field groups automatically go into a

00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,100
JSON file

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,770
no will you show it because it's amazing

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,210
so it's the same concept it's the same

00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,770
concept as this like if you're creating

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,780
field grips it'll automatically put your

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,940
field groups in a JSON file and then if

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,140
you like say that you inherit a project

00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,360
and another developers like here you go

00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,010
I'm done with it or like maybe you're

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,930
just picking up because they've set up

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,310
some things it'll put all the groups in

00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,810
there and you literally just hit sync

00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,480
and it brings all the field groups in

00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:34,110
from your JSON file so anyway so that's

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,550
another like another way to use

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:40,390
basically putting configuration inside

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:41,590
of code that's all I have but I if we

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,060
have like a minute or two I think for

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,060
questions I think you had a question

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,280
yeah so content is tricky

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,350
I actually just ripped like figured out

00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,660
that this there's a plugin called merge

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,550
bot and I have not used it yet but I was

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,050
hoping to get time to use it this week

00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:05,540
because that's always a question that I

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,160
get is like this is awesome for like the

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,870
configuration and whatever but how do I

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,270
do this with content and it looks like

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,670
merge bot is doing just that it's

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,040
actually on my list of things to do this

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,960
next week so if I make any like progress

00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,180
on that I can share it on Twitter but

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,650
feel free to reach out to me as well but

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,330
that is supposed to be version

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,920
controlling for your entire database and

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,330
so what that would obviously play the

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,740
content and some of the other stuff and

00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,780
it's really it looks really cool because

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,760
you can actually do like selectively

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,440
bringing in so if you're trying to put

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,760
two databases together it kind of lets

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,430
you go through and like check the things

00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,260
you want it has it a pretty price point

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,000
to it but if it's worth it

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,920
I think that that would be it's an

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,580
amazing resource if it does what I think

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:49,040
it's going to do so that's the short

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,660
link again the slides and the short link

00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,790
to give me feedback are both on my

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,310
Twitter account and so I'm Tessa k22 on

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,830
Twitter so feel free to download them

00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:59,510
use them share them whatever and if you

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,410
