Title: Tessa Kriesel: Configuration Management: WordPress Configuration in Code

Description: 
	Problem: You have a team of developers and you all work locally pushing up to one central development environment. Your client has been adding content to your live environment while your team is working away on other features. Your client decides they want to add calendar functionality to the site, which you can easily do with a plugin. However, configuring this plugin requires database changes. If you make any changes to your database, or even the development environment database, you are going to have to go make those changes again on the live site since they already have content in the site and you canâ€™t copy over that entire database.
UGH! There has got to be a better way! We have all been in this situation more than once. So how do we get out of this situation?!
Solution: Configuration Management! We will talk about what configuration management is and how you can start to use it in your current workflow. We will also talk about WordPress plugins that make our lives easier by using similar methodologies.
