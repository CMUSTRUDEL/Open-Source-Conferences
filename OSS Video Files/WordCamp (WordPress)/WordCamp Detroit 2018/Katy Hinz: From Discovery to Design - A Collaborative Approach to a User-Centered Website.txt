how was lunch good yeah I thought maybe

00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,600
the the after lunch group was gonna be

00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,639
like tired because you get that like dip

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,310
after lunch because well look like

00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,330
you're awake still so that's good so

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:25,660
yeah we're gonna talk about the whole

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,659
whole process today hopefully cramming

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,359
this into the next 35 40 minutes for you

00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:33,489
so from Discovery all the way to design

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,890
and we'll talk about all that different

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:39,610
stuff collaborating along the way for a

00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,230
user centric website so just a little

00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,830
bit about me obviously you heard a

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:47,050
little bit I'm a UX UI designer I

00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:49,480
started as a print designer kind of came

00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,760
over to the web side of things just

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,630
because I like to have my hands a lot of

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,360
stuff so and lots of that involves a lot

00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,940
of that like deeper thinking analysis

00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,640
which I like as well so kind of bringing

00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:07,079
that together with the visual design - I

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,969
work at a company called Co me a lot

00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,200
nonprofit and add a website so that's

00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,210
some of the stuff you'll see here that

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,729
I'm talking about when I get into some

00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:21,009
examples so just a little background of

00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:24,460
that so collaboration who likes to talk

00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:25,539
to people who hates to talk to people

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,969
yeah

00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:32,319
5050 meets a with sometimes so um it

00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:35,759
sounds like we have lots of different

00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:40,569
types of people a designer in the crowd

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:46,749
alright awesome who's a developer who's

00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:51,090
like us good awesome

00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:54,280
I know right yeah see that dude

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,359
there who's worked on a design project

00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,479
before that went bad

00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:04,770
yeah yeah most of us probably so a lot

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:07,060
of times when those projects go bad it's

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,319
because there's not a lot of

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,319
collaboration there's not a lot of

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,209
talking working with clients working

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,450
with the rest of your team along the way

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:18,670
so that's why it's super important

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,550
to do that in order to have a successful

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:25,209
project so we're also going to talk

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,610
about user centric design so what does

00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:32,709
that mean

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:38,890
anyone yeah yeah so we're really

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:41,020
thinking about what the there we go

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,850
alright we're really thinking about how

00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,760
are we creating this website for our

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,920
user so a little definition this might

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,140
be Wikipedia I can't remember I got it

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,750
but user centric design is a framework

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,570
of processes in which a user's

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,360
characteristics habits preferences and

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:02,230
goals are given extra special attention

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,540
at every stage of the the design and the

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,459
development process so we're doing that

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,480
in order to create the best user

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:14,650
experience possible so that's what is

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:17,530
critical of this whole process so why do

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:22,290
we need to collaborate for user centric

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,850
design as my mom says because I said so

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,799
just kidding does anyone else's mom say

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,420
that it was always the reason why we

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,700
couldn't do stuff so when clients users

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,930
and creatives so I've highlighted these

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,519
in different colors because those are

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,489
kind of like the big buckets of people

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,010
that are really critical to the whole

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,019
process of creating a website when all

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,290
of those buckets that people have common

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:50,230
consensus then decisions become obvious

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,690
so we start to get away from you know

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,910
well I want this and I want this when we

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,579
start to talk about what are the user

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,450
needs what are the users goals of the

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:04,090
site then we're focusing on that and

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,980
decisions are always geared towards how

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,190
is this going to be the best experience

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,840
for the user and then decisions start to

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,280
become more and more obvious as we go

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,380
through that so looking at just kind of

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,489
a general web design process these are

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,820
the steps that we're going to talk

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:24,039
through discovery starting out with that

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,740
research and gathering our information

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:29,020
doing some user mapping I'll get into

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,360
all the details of this stuff

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,430
mapping how is the user interacting the

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,470
site what are their goals what do they

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,720
look like ia or information architecture

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,729
UX is that user experience so that

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,039
typically comes kind of in that wire

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:49,930
framing phase and then we'll get into

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:54,970
some stuff about visual design so step

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:57,940
one discovery like I talked about this

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,750
is where a lot of anyone do like a lot

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,880
of the discovery research stuff yeah

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,580
yeah super important not always the most

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,130
fun unless you really like that stuff

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:16,120
but if you are like you know developer

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:21,190
or designer this this is nothing so

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:24,360
doing things like their needs what are

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,069
they trying to get out of the website

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,569
designing a website you might ask them

00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,780
what their pain points are on the

00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:34,389
current site also surveying stakeholders

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,000
so you know your client that's maybe

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,710
paying for this whole project they

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,870
probably have some goals of their own

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,889
it's more organizational type of type of

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,949
goals doing design surveys so you know

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:50,650
colors we need to stick to branding

00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:52,360
requirements things like that looking at

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,110
Google Analytics or any other sort of

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,669
analytic data may be looking at other

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,740
competitor websites kind of seeing

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,529
what's out there how do we make our site

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:06,360
better than what's really stand out from

00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:09,819
from other web sites in the space

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,889
usability testing we could do some some

00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:14,529
testing you know on the existing website

00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,639
scene and just observing people using

00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:19,659
the site seeing where they're getting

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:22,000
hung up establishing what pain points

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,370
might be in what goals might be and then

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,639
after doing all of this research it can

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:30,490
take weeks months maybe for larger sites

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,789
a really really good thing to do is have

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,870
a written website plan that's hard to

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,509
say

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,969
written web site plan at the end of it

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:42,490
that says here's what we did here's all

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,710
the stuff we found out here's our goals

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,229
and then coming together with your team

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,360
maybe asking your client for sign-off

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:54,220
even so we're all on the same page

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,280
before we go to the next step so we

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,380
found out some stuff what happens next

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,710
so the next step would be user mapping

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,770
so that's thinking about who are we

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,150
designing for and what do they need so

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,509
we're going to go through some of these

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:14,229
things together looking at some user

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:18,340
personas empathy maps and journey maps

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:21,250
so this can be really good a really good

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,919
way to help kind of put some color and

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,080
some flavor around who you're designing

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,759
the website for so who are we designing

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,900
for what do they need so this is Arthur

00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:38,380
Arthur is a an aficionado of superhero

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,940
stuff if you guys are not big into the

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:48,479
superhero space today is a national

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:48,479
superhero day so did I lose my thing

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:58,570
uh-oh someone's taken over my I don't

00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:10,570
know who this is I know I'm plug it plug

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:23,500
back in okay I'm not sure what's going

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:27,630
on here okay someone is really getting

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,630
into this collaboration aspect

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:52,020
yeah oh all right

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,480
hmm well I'll tell you a little bit

00:08:52,020 --> 00:09:00,470
about Arthur as hopefully they can get

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:03,570
me back up and running here so Arthur I

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:16,260
had this setup in kind of a persona

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:21,690
persona light so yeah cool we'll see if

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:24,300
that works so a little bit about Arthur

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,360
as we try to get this working again

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,970
Arthur is a 44 year old computer data

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,400
engineer so as we're thinking about our

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,950
users and who we're building this site

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,490
for I think I got distracted forgot to

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,710
mention that Arthur being a superhero

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,910
aficionado we're gonna build a website

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,840
for him for superhero stuff heroes of

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,540
the Month Club

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,280
so heroes of the month is gonna be go

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,650
along with me here a subscription

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,420
service oh there we go awesome

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:59,450
so heroes of the month is gonna be a

00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:03,270
section service for folks like Arthur to

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:05,910
sign up and get a new super year mm

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,810
every month so their task you know so

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,200
we're gonna pretend to build this

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,540
website today so this is a little bit of

00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,510
a persona about Arthur we've given him a

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:19,110
picture so we know what he might look

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:21,770
like I'm impatient about him he's 44

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,090
years old computers data engineer

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,610
perverted but not like this

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:29,100
collaboration workshop here he's

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,290
socially awkward but has a serious

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,720
girlfriend that he met online

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,970
high fists on what he cares about

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,430
everything else is just noise so as you

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:43,500
can see what okay spends money on

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,590
superhero collectibles this is his

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,800
passion and he really loves dressing up

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,190
in superhero costumes to impress his

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,030
small group of friends when they

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,790
get together so what is it like to be

00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,090
Arthur now that we kind of know will be

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:05,530
Arthur choke now that we know who he is

00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:08,410
let's think about what it's like to be

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,840
him and these exercises that I'm kind of

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:14,830
running through quickly like developing

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:19,270
a persona and this is is kind of an

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:21,550
empathy map exercise I recommend doing

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,060
these types of things with your team or

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:27,730
with your client then we start to really

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:33,600
like again collaborate that common

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:37,990
understanding of talked through this

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,810
surprises along the way so Arthur in

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,610
this empathy to showing a little bit

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,610
more about him some of the you know

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,500
things that he might be feeling some

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,320
outside influences that he might

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:54,400
experience what his pain points might be

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,530
and his tap goals so what kind of Chet

00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,210
through this a little bit together

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,670
thinking and feeling so he might be

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,580
thinking and feeling that I want to have

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:06,640
the best costume for the next party he

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,890
hearing and seeing he's he he likes to

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,560
watch movie talk there's a lot of drama

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,870
going on about the latest Marvel release

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,790
not being true to the comics so he's got

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:21,670
some outside influences that are

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:24,490
affected Oh what is he saying and doing

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,220
he's looking at other websites superhero

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,220
stuff calm that's a competitor of our

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,550
new website King at that considering

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,140
that instead pain points he's swamped

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,400
with work he doesn't have a lot of time

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:41,650
and then his top goal would be that he

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,470
wants to find what he needs very quickly

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:47,500
and then move on so does anyone else

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,140
have made me some ideas of what he might

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,050
be thinking and playing or experiencing

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:57,810
that we could kind of add to this list

00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:00,810
as I'm start to think about Arthur yeah

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,810
yeah

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,900
yeah so that's like a motivation he

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:10,480
wants to kind of impress some of his

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:13,190
friends yeah yeah yeah

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
right yeah I want to be authentic so

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,580
it's got to be you're like really good

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,860
quality stuff price point yep

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,020
thinking about that because he's you

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,210
know he does well as a data engineer but

00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,060
he spends a lot of his money on other

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:38,570
stuff so and we got anybody else maybe

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:40,010
one more yeah yes yeah yeah so that's

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,560
really great stuff as we start to think

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,600
about content and and how are we

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,360
building this site for our user that's

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,220
really concerned about you know finding

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,510
a really good costume an authentic

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:56,450
costume looking at cost and price

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:58,430
awesome so what does that experience

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:01,490
start to look like for him so now we

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:04,280
know we know who he is we know you know

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,540
his pain points his desires may be some

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:13,760
other influences he's experiencing so

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:17,900
this here you can see it is kind of a

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:23,720
journey map so mapping out his journey

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:26,120
and of course as a user we should also

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,400
be thinking that he's probably not

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,770
everyone is gonna go through this exact

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,870
path you know through the website but

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:37,850
this at least starts to get us thinking

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:41,150
about content ssin allottee coming back

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:45,160
to what the goals are you know with our

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,630
team as we go through these exercises so

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:53,540
starting with this first step here in

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:56,480
this app for Arthur would be discover so

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,770
he discovers the website somehow so how

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:04,070
might someone just discover a website

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:06,230
search yeah Google Facebook so they

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:11,770
still your answer poster

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,770
cool yeah convention our trade show

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:19,339
ads yeah yeah that's really good too so

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:23,750
thinking about how he's even your user

00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:25,820
is finding your website can really you

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,470
know drive some of that strategy as well

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,740
and maybe even some additional marketing

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:34,160
strategy behind the scenes so once he

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:40,370
site he cut the site and he starts gate

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:42,019
site initial step of getting familiar

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,570
with the site getting familiar with the

00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:48,829
brand so I first come to the website

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:52,060
what my day as art to do on the site

00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:52,060
what might I be looking for

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:58,970
look for costumes yeah so he probably

00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:07,060
wants to search or shop yeah he might be

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:13,750
looking for even wants to lie

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:20,470
sort by different yeah different ever in

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:24,580
video so yeah so that's like how he's

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:27,970
getting there he wants to we have to

00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:31,240
sort of some sort of functionality to

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,400
allow him to search for stuff or to

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,970
understand what we're doing up right

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,090
what we're offering once he gets

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,430
familiar hopefully he likes what he sees

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:45,130
we get to the next step of converting so

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:51,250
conversion so he's ready he likes he

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:53,370
found a costume he likes the the site to

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,370
allow

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:10,319
yeah that's super smart yeah I was

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,600
thinking about that great so he is he's

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,089
put his costume in the shopping cart

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,660
gone through the checkout process very

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:21,480
securely so he's happy with his purchase

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,299
so then of course we're hoping that

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,280
we're hoping he's happy we're hoping

00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:29,100
that then he comes back and we're

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,900
retaining him as a client so he might

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,970
want to you know buy again or qunari

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,100
engage with the site so if we're

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:43,530
thinking about content or functionality

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:46,190
for sir what might be different time you

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,190
come to the site

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:53,820
yeah yeah that's great

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:56,550
yeah so like other people bought this or

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,130
something like that we get this like

00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:10,110
mental of what we need to have on our

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:13,230
website also that he advocates or shares

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:23,190
this website with his friends so we'd

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:28,290
want to include what or this that is

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:36,110
offer yeah really good stuff okay

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:38,520
so a couple of pro tips as I mentioned

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,950
empathy Maps journey maps creating a

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,870
persona really important to do this with

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,670
your client otherwise you're just

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,360
talking at them and they probably don't

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:50,790
get it so if you go through this process

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,720
with them they have to actually like in

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:57,800
the shoes of the user and really under

00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:02,760
why we're doing it this way because

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,530
because the user add this to the

00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,510
shopping cart really fast and then

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,610
checkout you know in a seamless way and

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,930
it's not so much about what your client

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,420
wants it's more about what they use a

00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,550
lot so putting yourself in the shoes of

00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,890
the user forgetting about personal

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:20,850
preferences it's always difficult oh

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:22,710
it's a point of contention thinking

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,680
about the users experience from

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,620
different angles so that could be that

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,200
maybe he started his shopping experience

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,000
on his computer and then he got

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,170
distracted so later he's on his phone

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,240
goes back to it maybe he started through

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,610
a search and then when he went back he

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,260
just clicked on a you know a promotion

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,120
that was on the homepage to get to a

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:48,570
product so there's different paths to

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,060
info and then of course documenting all

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,890
of this stuff and getting sign-off

00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:58,350
before moving on to the next step so

00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,370
step 3 information architecture so this

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,350
is really

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,720
where we start to think about how are we

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,760
gonna take all these ideas that we just

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:14,100
started talking about and thinking about

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:18,510
the user journey power logical sense

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:21,180
this is a simple sitemap that I have use

00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,920
done and another project we've got our

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:28,410
homepage and then we've got top

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:36,690
navigation the top this apply resources

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:38,670
and tools trainings reports etc so we're

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,680
looking what's the most important

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,050
information what are those key landing

00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,350
page is gonna be and then what lives

00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:50,010
kind of in all of those sections so this

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:53,220
is just a really high-level breakdown of

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:56,190
you know how to organize your site and

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,250
the pages of the site so if we think

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:02,400
about Arthur and our visit heroes of the

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:05,730
Month Club what let's we'll just talk

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,880
about contol sections of the website

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:14,090
what might those in sections of the site

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:17,780
be I feel like that key student or this

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,780
star student of the class

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:45,070
right uh-huh

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:47,650
shop and discover yells yeah community

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:53,160
okay so like Eddie's space where he

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:56,830
could talk to other people okay cool

00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,510
categories yeah so ways to to shop but

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,470
then breaking that down so maybe it's

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:05,200
like I'm in searching my men are

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:08,410
searching by you know different types

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,780
and Marvel vs. DC and drop it on my

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:16,840
superhero knowledge today

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:19,090
I mean else that we missed yeah yeah I

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,740
think that's really important a lot of

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,190
times that's either like the first go-to

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,710
thing that people want to see or they so

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,860
just like basic information how does

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,799
this even work if this is for example a

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,390
subscription service type of site how

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:39,429
does that work you know how do I sign up

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:41,940
you know information like that - okay

00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:46,770
so a couple tips here in the

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,770
architecture information architecture

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,940
making that time in this in the project

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:58,270
schedule to iterate to go back and forth

00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:01,450
because what I really critical is that

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:03,010
as a web design expert I think I know

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,360
what I'm talking about and then I go

00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,730
share this with my client and they're

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,790
like nope that's not it because they're

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,280
the expert on their subject matter so I

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,410
can kind of guide the process of how to

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,660
organize information but there's

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,240
probably gonna be stuff I forgot or if

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,130
it's really a complicated subject matter

00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,440
I might just not get it right away so

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:29,330
making that space and time to go back to

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:34,970
fourth you keep page

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:45,170
template so as you know talk wordpress

00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:48,490
web design single page if you make each

00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:50,870
you so thinking about hey this is like

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,570
the search page and we're going to use

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:56,600
this type of page on multiple areas of

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,280
the site so just having framed app and

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,530
then you can you know change the

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,690
headline and change the body copy or

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,090
whatever but using that same page layout

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:09,620
will be important so thinking about

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:12,170
where we can reuse stuff that that sort

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,150
of thought process starts to come in in

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:17,270
the site mapping and information

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,070
architecture step making sure that

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:25,790
you're accounting for all the pages in

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:27,530
the site hey you know that okay under

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,670
tools and resources we need this this

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,310
and this so making sure we have

00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:35,630
everything accounted for as well and

00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:37,760
then as you are just kind of making this

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,040
outline of how your site's going to be

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,290
organized just making like bullet points

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,440
of okay I need a search function

00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,600
I need social media sharing function

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,090
just bullet pointing those things out

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,400
and checking in with your development

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,050
team making sure that we're not coming

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,240
up with some crazy functionality that

00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,180
wasn't scoped in the project to begin

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,120
with

00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:07,610
alright so user experience of course the

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:09,920
whole thing is user experience but a lot

00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:14,200
of times we think of user experience as

00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:17,000
this wire framing step so these are some

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,550
wireframes that I've worked on by

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,340
recently I think so wireframes are

00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:28,460
really really getting hierarchy of page

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,390
information together sure we have all

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,950
the content on a specific page a couple

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,930
what we're doing this in a fairly quick

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,800
way you can see this is all black and

00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:43,160
white grayscale so I'm kind of like

00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,800
blocking out like okay you know

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,640
a hero image up here and then I'm going

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,460
to have this map section down here you

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,830
know so I'm kind of chunking out

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,390
information just to make sure I have it

00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,270
all in the same way and I'm starting to

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,710
think even more about functionality and

00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:07,460
about actions

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:10,880
yes somewhere in Illustrator and I've

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:13,220
been using sketch lately yeah yeah

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,290
sketch is great I just I'm new at it but

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:20,120
it's good so yeah and then so typically

00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,930
the the projects that I work on we don't

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,970
have enough budget to do like a full-on

00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:27,350
grayscale prototype but that's always an

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,750
option if you're working on a large

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,190
budget project you can actually there's

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,580
tools out there where you can actually

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,310
like build your site in an interactive

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,780
way without having the design elements

00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,720
on there so it's like black and white

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:44,990
and kind of clicking through from page

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,640
to pay me that the content is all there

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,190
making sure that the navigation makes

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,800
sense so a lot that you can kind of

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:57,440
expand upon there oh and one other quick

00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,500
thing so I tend to work in pretty

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,870
detailed with pretty detailed wireframes

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,780
but you don't have to you can just do

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,790
like simple here's the box for this and

00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,000
then the box for call out and you know

00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:14,810
that kind of so it really can be a big

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,010
range so real quickly if we're thinking

00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:22,120
about our superhero website this is a

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:25,130
obviously very scaled back wireframe but

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,140
you know let's say we've got we want to

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,780
be sure to have space for like a big

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:32,240
beautiful image up at the top we want to

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,220
have a headline and then we've got you

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,860
know some call-outs that we're gonna put

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,640
on there so what might we just have for

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:43,430
like those three main call-out boxes

00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,250
yeah discover what's new yeah that's

00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:50,480
great we talked about that get an idea

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:53,150
what that Oh link - yeah like a like a

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,440
graphic that says like SHOP NOW or

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:57,110
something like that yeah

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,060
sales yeah that's a great idea

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,790
so we're thinking about okay what are

00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:04,490
the three most important things that I

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,290
want Arthur to have access to right away

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,960
and I'm putting those on the homepage

00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,610
you know front and center so then we've

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,880
got you know obviously the rest of the

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:16,460
content and then I just did you know a

00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,800
little mobile thing here too we want to

00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,720
of course be thinking about how does

00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,820
this stuff translate to mobile as well

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,210
this that's gonna be really important

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,010
because a lot of times you don't think

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,530
of it and then you start designing stuff

00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:33,080
a minute that's not gonna go well at all

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:43,460
so making sure to think about that

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:44,780
really yeah I myself have not designed

00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,480
that way

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:50,420
mostly because where I work our clients

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,780
are primarily desktop like they're your

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:57,770
users it's like 85% of users are desktop

00:28:53,780 --> 00:29:00,170
so we tend to design desktop first but I

00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,020
think it's an interesting way to do it

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:16,960
depending on who you're designing for

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:22,580
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah which is yeah

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,930
yeah yeah so if you you're Dave so Dave

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,800
was working on a project where they

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:29,990
started with desktop yeah and then once

00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,150
they got into that they realized 60% of

00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,350
their users were on mobile so that's

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,260
where it's really important to do that

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:39,100
discovery step event and looking you

00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:43,160
know like how are people gonna be know

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,200
that can help you know minimize those

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,310
kinds of things

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,310
so I'm gonna cruise through the rest of

00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:51,350
us a couple of tips here prepping

00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:54,020
clients for what wireframes are what

00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:57,590
they are not 10 the the feedback I

00:29:54,020 --> 00:30:02,630
always get is it's so boxy just a

00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:05,330
wireframe so it's not a notate patient's

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:08,330
throughout helping your client and also

00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,830
to your developers working out the major

00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,390
content issues

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,700
functionality doing that in the

00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,649
wireframe stage because then you're not

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,399
getting hung up on like design details

00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:23,140
all the time - della TI talked about and

00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:26,149
then I always like gut check developers

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,950
with my wireframes before I even show

00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:29,899
them to the client and then once again

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,860
is like right before we start design at

00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:37,130
a minimum just to make okay we on scope

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:42,230
and crazy that kind of thing so getting

00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:45,980
into design as a design you're often

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:50,120
involved in most or all of these steps

00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:53,539
so you're going to be the one project so

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:58,010
it's your job to advocate for the user

00:30:53,539 --> 00:31:00,289
and also sell these ideas to the client

00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:03,500
to convince the client that this is what

00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:03,980
they want to do so a couple of things to

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:10,490
think about

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:16,789
I can't you're you're using consistent

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:20,029
design patterns you know not like too

00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:22,580
many headline style worth thinking about

00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:25,669
interactions are there any animations

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,649
hover instances thinking about that kind

00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,360
of stuff and then usability and

00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:33,440
accessibility I think there's a talk on

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:36,860
that afternoon color content people with

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,500
disability website that kind of stuff so

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:42,289
just a couple of quick examples of stuff

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,639
that I've worked on just show related

00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:49,700
from wire to visual design

00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:52,970
most of these are straight forward

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:56,029
because I like to work out issues of

00:31:52,970 --> 00:32:00,980
even you know some layout type of stuff

00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:02,570
with the client before adding adding in

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:08,120
color and style and that sort of thing

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:11,090
so any quick ideas design elements you

00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,070
might want to use for this guy comic

00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:16,250
book stuff yeah so maybe even like

00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:19,149
cartoony style or something anything

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,149
else one more yeah

00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,440
so a lot of since a lot of the costumes

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:31,380
might be really colorful and you know

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,030
easy the design can be very to allow

00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,440
like the photos and the you know

00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,440
costumes to really stand out

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:44,370
so again advocate the leaving personal

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:49,290
preferences out of it loves blue you're

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:52,260
gonna have to deal with that using as

00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:54,930
wisely so it should experience not annoy

00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,110
people thinking about how you're just

00:32:54,930 --> 00:33:00,330
gonna translate this to code maybe even

00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:03,300
thinking about like content types

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:10,710
how are they gonna even build this being

00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:12,810
very very prepared to you should never

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,360
just be mail it over without any

00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:17,610
explanation because 95% of the time

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,470
they're not gonna get it so and then

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,050
every decision should be intentional

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:25,770
have a reason behind it chorus gotcha

00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:28,200
with development along the way so then

00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:31,800
handing this off hinting your design off

00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,700
to your development team and it's you as

00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:38,550
a designer to translate the users needs

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,320
and goals into that time and then you

00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,770
have to make sure that your desire

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,540
developer can do all this understand

00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:49,230
what you're into

00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:51,810
so making that really clear and doing

00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:53,910
that with you know some sort of handoff

00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,820
development specs or something like that

00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:59,370
so I've done this before where I've just

00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,560
done bullet points in a Google Doc but

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,050
being very specific on you know I want

00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:10,800
it to do this listen this giving them

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:13,860
the design file and just adding little

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,480
annotations of you know okay this is the

00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,919
navigation and when someone clicks on it

00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,510
it should just take them down the page

00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:23,909
or whatever so adding in those details

00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,070
so for that handoff nothing should be a

00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,679
surprise at this point because we've

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:31,310
been collaborating hopefully gut

00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,990
checking with development along the way

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:36,780
talking like I said about content types

00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:39,480
how those might work in

00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,790
actions any of those animations sharing

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,830
examples of how you want or maybe doing

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:46,740
a mock up if you're if you have any

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,550
animation skills desktop and mobile

00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,650
specs

00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:54,419
how are things going to convert to

00:34:49,650 --> 00:35:00,470
mobile and making sure to have time to

00:34:54,419 --> 00:35:04,110
QA the site design on it of develop I

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:09,350
pier client and this is maybe the most

00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:14,130
important thing be as to your developer

00:35:09,350 --> 00:36:03,090
this for you so I've got a few minutes

00:35:14,130 --> 00:36:05,510
for right yeah so that's a great

00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:09,360
question he's asking about how do I

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:11,310
place you know calls to action or the

00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,310
important stuff on my home page on the

00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:16,920
website so that's where we can start

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,630
pointing back to that discovery stuff

00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,380
that we did at the very beginning or the

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:25,020
surveys user personas we should all know

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:26,670
by the time we get to wireframes

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,490
InDesign we should all know what the

00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:32,550
number one goal is for the user and that

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:36,750
should be the biggest thing on the home

00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:39,090
page it's oftentimes that once you get

00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,710
into visual design then the client is oh

00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,630
but I want to say this this and this

00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,250
about my organization front and center

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,430
it's like well that's not what they're

00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:49,320
looking for so that's again where you

00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,400
can keep pointing back to well we've

00:36:49,320 --> 00:37:12,210
already talked about this we

00:36:50,400 --> 00:37:14,849
already come to this consensus yeah yeah

00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,579
yeah so I worked on a question was how

00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:20,640
do you bounce serving multiple audiences

00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,890
I would say or multiple users I've

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,799
worked on a lot of sites recently where

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,690
there are three or four types of

00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:30,119
audiences and they're all equally

00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,710
important and we've kind of started

00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,010
playing around with like a curated

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:38,730
experience type of thing where I come to

00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:41,190
the homepage and it says I am a parent

00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,470
you know there's a box for parent I am a

00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,990
teacher you know I am a prospective

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:53,609
student so then on the home page it's a

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:56,640
little as a parent and I get to you know

00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:58,920
almost like a sub-site of that that's

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,109
just information for me and then you can

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,029
kind of follow that you know typical

00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:04,559
process of okay then this is the most

00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:09,170
important thing for the parents you know

00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,170
that sort of thing yep

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:21,630
yeah very messy yeah I started as a

00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:25,260
print designer but I was always really

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,789
interested in web and recognized that it

00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:32,099
was gonna be sticking around for a while

00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:33,690
so I did I don't know 15 years ago

00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:36,000
probably like just taught myself

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,279
Dreamweaver that was like the thing at

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,220
the time you know from a book I'm sure

00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:46,010
it was Dreamweaver in a weekend so I did

00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,010
that kind of learned some stuff and that

00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:52,829
growth for me it was just getting a job

00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:54,510
at a web design agency and learning

00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:56,609
their process and learning from other

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,860
people so like finding those groups of

00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:01,850
people that you can learn from

00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,850
your question

00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:26,770
oh how participants yeah that's always

00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:31,150
it's a part we typically try to ask the

00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:34,690
client to provide you know however many

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:36,880
they can yet and then we would done some

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,130
stuff where it's like on-site user

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,020
testing where we you know have a

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:45,339
checklist and kind of try to have people

00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:48,460
complete a task see if they well or not

00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:51,220
I know their current websites to that

00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,740
you can do like even usability test you

00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,930
can probably do some more background

00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,250
research of competitor sites as well

00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,250
sometimes it's hard to get

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,170
uh-huh right

00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:26,240
yeah yeah I mean you can even that is

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:29,150
but it's something like you know if you

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,329
interview ten people you're gonna get

00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:34,520
about 80% of your data and then they're

00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:36,260
sort of reinforce that so you can work

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:39,670
from a small sample size if that's all

00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:43,700
you have to Italy some inform you and

00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:48,220
then it's it's you know really important

00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,220
to go through those steps of like the

00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,180
really try to pretend that you are that

00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,250
user and like go through that process

00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,000
instead of going through it just like as

00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,450
yourself

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,460
- so I think that's about it I'll be

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,619
hanging out in the back if you guys want

00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:07,750
to ask me more questions but I got some

00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:07,750
