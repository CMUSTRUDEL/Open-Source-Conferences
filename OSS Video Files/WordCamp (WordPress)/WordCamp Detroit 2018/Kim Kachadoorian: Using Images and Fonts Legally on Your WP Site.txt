so even on a few the deficits that

00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:27,789
hashtag I'm a marketer so this picture

00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:32,619
here is plus and will be did you learn

00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:35,950
analysis how about to get burned in a

00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,370
reason for this is because you know

00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:42,070
there are tools out there I call them

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,520
that because they sit in rooms and if

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,060
you look for people that have stolen

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,700
images they weren't that than jus an

00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,630
attorney the attorney context the

00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:59,320
copyright owner and then they tell their

00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:03,010
send out a letter to that person and say

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:12,480
hey not only SSS decent assist but we

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:12,480
plant some money so who will get into

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,390
what we choose a picture whatever

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:28,060
creates the image that you're using

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,710
almost no copyright can you use it we'll

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,580
look at some opportunities where you

00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:42,340
Kevin this is a lot of jargon this is

00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:46,200
all by the way I'm so tell people you

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:49,890
should know how to defend yourself and

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,890
here's the reason why

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,229
$100,000 what yeah

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:05,250
so my friend calls me he panicky he

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,070
garden he Ernie got a letter it's a

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,700
cease-and-desist letter and it says info

00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:14,300
by the way if you did this intentionally

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,730
you ran a search on 400 thousand dollars

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,880
and he thought that he was using yet

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:25,820
properly it's a website that doesn't

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:30,030
make money but because the website is a

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,890
company that makes money they were

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,140
perfectly within the rights to stop

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:43,860
collecting he's like oh my god might

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:57,209
have to get a new resume myself

00:02:43,860 --> 00:03:00,720
I mean was still in the cold guess what

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,850
yes Kimberly Khachaturian jokingly two

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,730
of us and the whole USA in a booth

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,370
Luke's in San Diego pretty easy to

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,660
figure out who to send the military what

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,540
I meant to was to prove that I didn't

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,239
have anything to do with that website

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,940
any partner so we're recording take your

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,329
name our both any pieces when you

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,030
transfer them over it is in the code in

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,780
an interim threat to accompany in India

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:34,049
and then stolen some images from a

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,579
sister site of Getty Images Getty Images

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:43,230
is like the mirror that you can imagine

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:45,480
they're like colossal photos in the

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,909
sense that they have attorneys they have

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,459
people just looking to see

00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,680
so don't do it and the company there had

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:58,739
not only stolen some images but they had

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,739
to do some testing that they could use

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,090
so little things I do is I keep every

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:08,019
single yeah but it took me about three

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,760
months to get that fixed my friends with

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,889
one hundred thousand dollar bill

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,040
they did not pay hundred thousand I

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,139
think they close to 4,000 nem to make

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,549
sure those Raiders don't have time until

00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:25,389
the bill is paid so little things that I

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:28,000
do now is I keep of my folder of every

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:30,039
single company I do business with and

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,759
will look a little bit at fixalot later

00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:38,500
I take my copy of license at the time

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,270
that just something I keep a PDF of

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,120
everything that was in that's when I

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:48,250
just purchased interest assignment off

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,830
King bunch of images in I take a PDF of

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,889
that looks really ugly but it and keep

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:56,860
it so everything that was in it and keep

00:04:53,889 --> 00:05:01,120
a copy of the license so those two go

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:29,409
into places then under that I fix a lot

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:31,990
of PDF licenses so if anyone says hey

00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:35,259
you know you shouldn't be using that

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:40,740
that's my image that's my happy returns

00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:40,740
make I downloaded it from unsplash

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,740
[Music]

00:06:07,070 --> 00:07:08,780
you know this even though it's your

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,380
image do whatever you want

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:17,190
what if you suggest is that you downsize

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,960
the image to 72 yeah if you're not sure

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:25,040
what that is if you love my website

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,040
there's an excellent 72 dpi

00:07:25,320 --> 00:08:56,740
in there so you can use years ago what

00:08:49,750 --> 00:09:04,780
there's also a lot of beautiful so we

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:07,690
range Liana that you say dad loves late

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:12,370
I want it to be something official I

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:18,089
don't want to be careless how do they

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:20,050
both campus okay the manager is great

00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,830
you can use them for pretty much

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,660
anything

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,800
which is great a lot of the really old

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,550
ones not that

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:35,899
in resolution but they new ones like us

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:39,529
armed so I let people it's all Creative

00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:49,430
Commons not go through each Creative

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:53,029
Commons is and it applies to finalized

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:56,600
images it applies to some software and

00:09:53,029 --> 00:10:01,730
basically it means I kind of designed it

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,850
from other people to confuse and change

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:08,240
the code little and hands the code and

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:15,940
all Creative Commons have some type of

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,940
places they go from easiest to remember

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,149
probably serie means no copyright and

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,000
you know yeah I'm going back to that

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:30,800
picture I said kind of to people on how

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:45,260
dear a really it silent / in that sense

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:47,270
of this case hero but you know and so

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:55,760
they keep any more of them applicators

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:59,329
allow you to remix it or to almond and

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,060
programs and I actually when I do

00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:05,110
derivatives I'll take the original image

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,320
and I might pass it up so so who feel

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:15,560
important

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:17,270
you've never know sometimes thank you by

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,070
giving credit and they'll say thanks I

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,560
would've never thought it was my picture

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:26,480
or things I didn't even think about

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,100
going back to it Creative Commons is a

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,650
great rating ism

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,380
 to use and that lets you know

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,870
with use on moonslayer and this my

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,280
eyesight goes down all the way to this

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:42,260
one is Creative Commons actually use the

00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:56,720
image which you can take derivatives you

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:59,330
can play with evening Emily favor use

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:04,070
this is where my friend out of trouble

00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:07,070
it's on your thousand dollars one color

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,300
the drag gray elephant room if you read

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,970
in a description

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:16,810
I beg you know when is fair use and I

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:20,360
tried to make that symbol is possible

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:24,100
you know and that's when he got into

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,200
trouble and he would last for some

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,860
environment fair use the attorneys not

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:36,470
different names for the copyright so I

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:39,350
mean John he had a lack of legal cases

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:43,190
yet behind this hand stuff so until we

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,430
have that as presently it's a tough

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,520
situation out there

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:52,550
the other one is editorial again a

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,130
fairly new kind of use usually means

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,710
that it's going attitude like New York

00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:02,330
Times or something like that it often

00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:05,990
has things like stars and the president

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:11,620
things like that but then you usually

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:14,759
pay and

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,759
[Applause]

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:43,910
I'm afraid we do can use it around you

00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:47,899
can use it over and over again once you

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:49,750
purchase it and you know it's George to

00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:53,149
play with right

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:55,519
whereas rights manage which is where the

00:13:53,149 --> 00:14:01,060
companies that birth of education I used

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,060
to work at random Patrol they have some

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:14,510
and once you get that like two-year

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:18,490
remark one day month if you plan to read

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:21,589
keep continuing using this you must have

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:24,200
some rings managed also say that you can

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:28,510
only use it once and you're done if you

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,510
want to use it again you got a license

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:40,820
the big thing with they replaces like us

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:44,589
black wonderful beautiful image right

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,589
there are 300 dpi

00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:09,950
the only mom already says so you wanna

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:15,590
model release because this woman is

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:52,640
beautiful is 300g piece it came from one

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:55,610
slash but what if she's my husband's an

00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:08,630
architect really annoys him when

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:19,370
somebody takes building much work into

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:22,490
the property releases sometimes when I

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,770
picture a there's a there's a similar

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,410
from Michigan Avenue

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:29,120
they're really cool I mean I meant that

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,820
love just take pictures of the songs are

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,810
so what I do is I actually come out when

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:38,150
I go in and backgrounds apartments wait

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,390
a bit that clean but so it's not

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:48,400
distinguishable around in the other you

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:52,480
place a lot of times to why

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:56,320
lying doesn't lack caveat to using them

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,080
you can't use that like one tonight

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,380
anything that denigrates another human

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,380
being those extra things and right

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,740
because being the model don't worry

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,290
about that they're gonna pay $200

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,900
tomorrow you know out here and sit down

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:23,880
and take pretty pictures and they never

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:27,010
thought them so fearful look at releases

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,170
again for a presentation something I'm

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,780
not to be personally I don't worry about

that's so much like I'm doing every a

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:49,300
lot more about it to maintenance

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:52,270

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,990
Images but I still have my old receipt

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:39,040
that shows that that use it over and

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,980
over again but what I did was I ran it

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,550
through like a reverse image ticket

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,610
theme so images that google.com you can

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:53,260
upload a photo and see how many places

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,920
that ampere flows are so here's the

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,730
funny thing

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,740
this is how

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:04,950
music mom's never gonna say it enough

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:09,080
for it so even if I go all the way out

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:14,039
to like I think it was 20

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:17,279
yeah yeah so if like any of your friends

00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:21,029
are saying my premium salt advantages of

00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,710
them in any could see it's all these

00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:26,460
different images or something like that

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:32,639
so I'm sure she had no idea what she

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:42,149
said yes what that actually meant yeah

00:19:32,639 --> 00:20:06,179
she ended up flying it was funny so this

00:19:42,149 --> 00:20:09,690
is yeah but it's a derivative it's still

00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,789
the same picture I can also a woman call

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:40,580
traffic Sorrell it and make it work

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:40,580
really weird and no they were computers

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:49,889
but there's a lot of things you should

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,830
know all odds silly all kinds in the

00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:56,340
context of license

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:57,800

00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,960
it

00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,750
because whoever owns em hunt for the

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,240
cream in that font sometimes people

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:11,550
bring distributed unequally a there's

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,650
three Disney in fact got permission in

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,210
personal talk to it even inflicted

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:37,860
persons data on just duck right and

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:42,390
never use a Pontus yes 90 relationship

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:47,360
coffee just be fine hold on do they have

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:51,800
put your turn mmm really being attorneys

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,440

it just tell you I'm sorry

00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:03,560
do any of you live in Dexter Chelsea

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,510
okay if you didn't know this story

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:17,570
there was a woman that worked for the

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:17,570
Dexter treatment and she was

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,549
[Music]

00:22:47,400 --> 00:23:37,770
she was so fired people like me several

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:40,230
resumes I can do this job better but the

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,940
way that she used to justify a big deal

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:47,300
and I still don't know if Disney

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:53,580
everything for them so don't do it

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:58,260
always license to use in the future

00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:04,740
I just do this usually it's fairly cheap

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:06,800
it's really expensive it's just good to

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:14,060
keep it I keep it a summer full per

00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:17,550
personal use in commercial use this is a

00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:20,040
bohemian are a great place to pass the

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:23,220
class and study is a great scientist on

00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,080
Telegraph these are his rules you can

00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,360

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,260
please give credit something like that

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:38,460
once you use just buy a fresco by by God

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:41,370
and only to escape if you're going to

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,350
earn money for project involving this

00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:54,720
and consider it correct to make your

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:57,900
tummies and then I put in here or if

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,410
this product is used for private venture

00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,930
you should always donate some money but

00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,790
I was a great fan of many kinds great

00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,350
image so I'm gonna have him push it in

00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,660
here give me an idea of what some of

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,540
them want you and other places where you

00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:22,170
can find them again

00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:25,110
the cool water so I would read and men's

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:27,650
user License Agreement no manner of

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,850
words that are images for class

00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,890
understand when it says if it's too

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:35,490
complicated that friend that went to law

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:38,130
school reader for you a lot of them are

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,680
desktop apparently since even the last I

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,020
used to work at a printer or your

00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,780
stylist asked you know it had fancy

00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,570
pants or on Google plants or or web

00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:51,500
fonts that were normal you know you have

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,500
laces

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:58,170
what it finds usually display correctly

00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:04,560
but if you buy a beer you will find to

00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:07,260
Munich that it into your CSS me sure

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,140
that it displays correctly because if it

00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,750
doesn't show the cool looking front it

00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,870
should at least display like with the

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,000
normal five back or whatever so that

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:20,160
people can still read into something

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,410
like it's a language

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,210
open licensing is very much like

00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,670
Creative Commons I just always kinda

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,390
double check to make sure it's a legit

00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,740
site and then the commercial is

00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:38,360
basically using it for anything

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:41,360
money-wise any questions yes so we were

00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,360
working

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,849
[Music]

00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,249
[Applause]

00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:50,539
but one thing you usually came to is you

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:55,009
can't usually hand applying you can have

00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:58,789
the images or whatever - you can't say

00:27:55,009 --> 00:28:03,159
here's your five but look at the user as

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:08,659
well yes and when you install WordPress

00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:12,229
the things that you that you get and

00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:15,409
they have a lot of images in there are

00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:22,539
they are they open open like something

00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:25,460
pretty much use them without but also

00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:28,399
certainly a differential between the

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,080
themes that come with WordPress and then

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,049
a theme that maybe you when we find any

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:43,029
market this is exactly that is a whole

00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:47,659
other story but okay so yeah another

00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:48,860
right if I buy my freedom and they have

00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,860
they have

00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:55,220
I still have to check and see if the

00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:57,250
whole farm can be you I have let me have

00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,250
it

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:14,929
so like you know

00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:17,840
Kimberly's fast and it's a little more

00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:19,460
innovative day-to-day of course Dean you

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,100
wouldn't want to read through the

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,010
quality enforced issue on their license

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,690
to say abyss anywhere in there you know

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:31,039
the photos that we included this theme

00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:32,960
are you may assume call a novelty

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,600
you know the images we include with our

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,240
cleaner for demo purposes only and so

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:55,220
you're not actually about so you're

00:29:38,240 --> 00:30:00,860
going to probably get you know they're

00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:03,049
just giving you the example but yeah I

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:06,789
feel comfortable anything I get from

00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:11,590
WordPress donors yeah everything else

00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:16,519
and then they might give you an image

00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:21,139
like unsplash which you know it's pretty

00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:26,799
enough even for about even the big ones

00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:26,799
like elemental knowledge detective stuff

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,179
just because let me tell you when you

00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:37,850
get a ten thousand dollar bill or a

00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:41,800
hundred thousand dollar bill in the mail

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,930
it should fit once on our Friday you

00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:49,910
[Music]

00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:52,820
in him yeah the interesting thing was my

00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:57,290
bill was that it was for a trekking site

00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:59,930
in Nepal and when I was doing it the guy

00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:02,840
who was a trekker used to send me these

00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:05,360
just stunning pictures of like yaks up

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,120
in the mountains at the top right it was

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,210
a beautiful photographer so why they

00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,870
need from the need to go out get some

00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:21,550
other images that really weren't as good

00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:24,920
no idea but yeah you can track my images

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:27,020
you know if I make something I put code

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,720
into the background and then if I find

00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,800
that somebody's using it not say you

00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,710
know could you at least give me credit

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:37,640
or you know you're using this for a

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:41,000
for-profit business and cease and desist

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:47,900
and if they don't and they break the end

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:56,320
of their ISP provider web page and

00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:58,940
sometimes you only know by looking so in

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,000
Herbert there's a web design company

00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,280
called him like and they had this

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,030
beautiful website it was so beautiful

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:12,460
company in China not only copied all

00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:15,460
code but left of direct links to

00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,460
websites

00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:38,830
one of the Chinese went saver yeah and

00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:40,540
so that's how they found out was yes you

00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,460
mentioned that models obviously kind of

00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,240
had a different thing with them drop

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,320
pets is there any rights to animals and

00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,660
probably usually that I think I've got

00:32:47,320 --> 00:33:05,350
somebody come back and say that's my I

00:32:48,660 --> 00:33:15,640
have rights to this and because anything

00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:17,920
that's out there like I've Instagram so

00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,410
like the means that go around on

00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:24,600
Facebook probably not that big a deal if

00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,600
you start a classroom on your website or

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,490
just general like a celebrity animals

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:47,170
sometimes what I'm doing right now is

00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,910
and maybe this is wrong but did you go

00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,370
to google you can do a search by the

00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,840
right usage rights so I don't know if

00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,370
that's accurate I maybe you can comment

00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:00,750
on that and how to find out more

00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:00,750
information what you find like you know

00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:18,130
they comment that's interference yeah

00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:23,680
everywhere lovely okay no it's it's open

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:25,840
resource but yes it's we live in a

00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:31,810
strange world I mean I could talk about

00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:36,159
this next month and make a change and

00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:39,639
you know our bottles in raids or

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,309
behind our litigious society and if

00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:46,919
there's two or three lawsuits start

00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:50,319
favoring when is high then you gotta

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:52,690
tell people you got a pen I put myself

00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:55,869
out there all the time because I kept a

00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,539
reverse image search things and make

00:34:55,869 --> 00:35:01,510
sure they're legit oh I was gonna show

00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:06,940
you one thing - so the reason I use pics

00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:10,990
a lot so here it is this is big stock

00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:19,829
this is again you can just say and you

00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:23,589
know if I kissed all of the licensee and

00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:28,650
recently the pixel look is if I buy a

00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:32,440
pad here's pretty much another licensing

00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:38,980
it's very simple you know you can use it

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:45,119
for everything so I do buy packs from

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:45,119
them and they sell these like bundles

00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,940
fun those are always short time so this

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:06,059
six days 18 hours 18 hours 18 minutes

00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:09,579
and so like this is the society cannot

00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:13,260
in taste this is what I say no keep up

00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:18,039
plus the license so I know everything

00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:23,840
you can see i'm scrolling but still way

00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:26,959
out there if it inspires you can't

00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,959
[Music]

00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:43,300
all these fonts and now you know for me

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:46,770
if there's like five semesters and then

00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,770
I start seeing Coulson's

00:36:47,760 --> 00:37:00,970
that also you turn there things like

00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:03,460
this are like oh yeah I loved about

00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:06,310
their packages they had a whole bunch of

00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,560
those kind of moments yeah they know how

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:13,990
they're created twenty days are sunny

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:20,020
and it's pixel oh yeah well it feels 20

00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:22,420
min out it actually by 85 for $29 but

00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,030
you know like things that keep up some

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:29,380
bold that I want coming after in from my

00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:33,210
attorney review the basis but you also

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,210
know nothing about the social system

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:44,020
that is what happens if you get image of

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:47,050
someone I exchange I'm a contractor or

00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:49,120
this pic does get images syndrome he

00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,180
notices his heart in terms of show the

00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,910
boss so this is all the way it's like

00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:59,470
the wild wild west out there I'm sweet

00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:05,710
new yeah I think it would be injustice

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:09,100
not always friendly company because

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:12,640
they're bitten her vet it's always

00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:15,790
interesting to me to see the kinds of

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,770
trouble that people can get into I'm

00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:20,260
sorry I was just kind of sitting cover

00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,670
your but these little license

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,940
so when I download something from

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,650
unsplash I actually make a PDF of it I

00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,080
love it because it's a picture right

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,170
there off the PDF and then it says

00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,900
mostly useful app because what

00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:37,020
it's not months but they'll put people

00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,450
but you were talking about illness liens

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,900
things like that but they're giant

00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:45,869
images so you have to assume probably

00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:48,780
some that size of idiots actually owns

00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:52,109
it because you don't usually get this

00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:56,309
huge image sizes without it being

00:38:52,109 --> 00:39:01,500
somebody's like when I take my cannon

00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:03,210
yeah it's you know

00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,599
oh my might take a picture I mean that's

00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,880
good enough and then I'm not saying like

00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,490
it's pretty enough but it's got enough

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:17,640
pixels I'm gonna cover them and show

00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:23,160
them that stuff to actually show up it's

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:37,079
just I'm just trying as much as you can

00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:46,260
use your own okay so though that work

00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:47,460
let's say work without a solution is

00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:52,200
that kind of evidence

00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:55,349
okay this is my photo right yeah usually

00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,980
ask for a season two so so person out of

00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:01,079
using if they're losing them outside

00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,940
that might denigrate you know certain

00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:08,250
people or something even if it's a big

00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:09,829
Trevor tree don't care you go straight

00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:13,049
to their is p.net

00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:15,510
say this is the page cease and desist on

00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:18,180
cafeteria then if things off I never

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:24,690
talk to an attorney but usually I space

00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:27,420
are pretty good about yeah I always

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:30,010
suggest not putting even by the data and

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:34,440
and I always assign nothing

00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:41,680
certain not useless there as well

00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:48,100
also know people operate yes copyright

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:50,950
as soon as you create something you

00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,480
create something for copyright trademark

00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,670
is a whole other story

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,970
you're singing them this is my logo and

00:40:54,670 --> 00:41:00,460
then in order to trade like that in drum

00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,530
then you get the show only first you see

00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,930
it you have to have all of you somewhere

00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:07,300
there's all these requirements that then

00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,460
you apply and get it free platform but

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,320
that's way different

00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,140
I have to record all three we were the

00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:34,960
second community you have doctor in the

00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:36,340
back yes sometimes so there were angry

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,010
things that look similar

00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:49,270
so I'm getting took over stock exchange

00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:52,750
they did not but the idea that I can go

00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:55,210
endlessly out on pages that help that

00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,460
woman either into it she's really

00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:59,410
compensated up because I think there

00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:03,450
were there was a seventh like five or

00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:06,520
six images on her and just maximally as

00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,720
you know nice-looking woman we were

00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,860
going to use around our website

00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,860
controller guerrillas

00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:27,920
I usually put it in like the caption or

00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:28,359
something or you know thank you when I

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,490
do

00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:44,500
LinkedIn articles and stuff so it just

00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:44,500
