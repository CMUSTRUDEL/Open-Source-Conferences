Description: 
	Trying to break out of the hourly trap? Love the idea of supplementing your client work with steady, reoccurring revenue? I was in your shoes three years ago when I launched my first successful product. Now we maintain around ten premium WordPress products.
In this talk Iâ€™ll discuss how to launch your first product including coming up with ideas, putting together a team, marketing strategy and what to expect.

hours a week that meant I had a total of

00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:11,620
160 hours to work per month on average

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,480
but I also knew that only half of my

00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,440
time was actually billable I was

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,450
spending the other half the time on

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,539
basic business administration things

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,060
which means I really only had 80 hours

00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:25,090
to earn money doing billable work for

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,800
clients now in the WordPress service

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,410
industry you're probably looking at

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,050
somewhere between 35 and 150 dollars per

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,390
hour which is a pretty big range but

00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,039
that means per month you're probably

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,430
looking at if you're able to bill out

00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:42,670
all of your time $2,800 to $12,000 max

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,320
per month per person now if you want to

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,739
do nice things like take a vacation

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,350
maybe you want 10 10 days off well

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,660
that's 80 hours that you've lost -

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,460
opportunity costs which could cost you

00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,449
somewhere in the realm of you know

00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,190
$1,400 to $6,000 there's a lot of other

00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:01,570
issues that I ran into relating to

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,600
trying to grow my business and improve

00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,760
it for example when I was slammed and a

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,740
hot lead came in the door chances are

00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,479
that was a lost opportunity there was

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,670
nothing I could do about it if I got

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,110
mentioned on the the national news and

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,930
every came flooding to my website and I

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,850
was already busy by the time I was able

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,420
to actually service those leads they

00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:25,390
could be gone meanwhile if I went into a

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,750
slow period and nobody was contacting me

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:32,350
I better it save some money right as

00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,790
otherwise boosting the pay me nobody and

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,430
on average it could take somewhere

00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,860
between 5 and 15 hours just to sign a

00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,880
client just to get to the point where

00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,110
they're gonna pay me to start doing

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,780
something so that I actually can start

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,040
working so I thought about different

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,200
ways that I can improve this situation

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,850
how can I grow my company when it's a

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,380
service business and obviously I could

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,439
have worked more and suffered work/life

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,630
balance now at the time I was single so

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,610
it was easier to do that there's always

00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,740
the option of hiring right but that's a

00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,210
chicken in the egg thing do you hire

00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,130
somebody and hope to get more business

00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,390
in order to fill their time or you try

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,850
and win a whole bunch of work and hope

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,860
you can find the right individual to

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,420
service the customers before it's too

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,400
late

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,070
now there's outsourcing but of course

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,300
there's trouble there too right you're

00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,720
subject to their availability

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,920
if there

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,570
really busy they might not be able to

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,180
help you out they don't know your

00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,010
processes as well as you do they can be

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,320
really expensive they can be hard to

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,030
find you have to build that trust

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,250
so even outsourcing isn't all that

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,890
useful and of course with service

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,140
industry you get things like this I mean

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,670
we don't really have a deadline but we

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,680
need it in four days or the design is

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,790
too dark the color black reminds the

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,790
elder bility that death is coming

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,910
there's things about the service

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,010
industry that are incredibly frustrating

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,290
as much as I love it and love working

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,670
with clients so over the next few years

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,180
I did a little bit of everything

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,030
get everything bagel yeah I built a team

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:06,340
I did some outsourcing I certainly works

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:07,660
more but I kept coming back to this this

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,550
thought that there has to be an easier

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,440
way there has to be a better way to grow

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,690
my company especially once I had a

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,480
family and had kids it became really

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,730
hard to work later and once I had a team

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,680
I had to really worry about can we

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,150
produce enough work and we do enough

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,170
billable hours that we can support

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,420
everybody we won't have to worry about

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,820
making payroll and the question always

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,209
became how do I break free how do I even

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,030
out the peaks and valleys I always had

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,700
this idea that a product or maybe

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,950
multiple products was it would be a good

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:43,180
way to supplement the service business

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,860
because with products your income is not

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,299
directly tied to your time obviously

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,489
there's gonna be time investment but the

00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,250
income is separate and - not a

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,160
one-to-one which means it's a lot more

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,000
predictable you can expect oh clearly

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,610
there's gonna be some peaks and valleys

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,620
but it's not so project to project it's

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,480
not so extreme month to month and you

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,980
can even start to see seasonality over a

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,450
period of time you know that hey

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,950
everybody's on vacation in the summer

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,890
don't worry if you're not getting as

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,940
many sales it's also very scalable so

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,980
that situation I was talking about

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,310
earlier where you get mentioned in some

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,169
big media outlet well you can sell lots

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,380
of copies of your of your product online

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,940
or lots of licenses online and it

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,260
doesn't necessarily mean that that each

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,960
of those is tied to a certain amount of

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,330
time in order to fulfill that order and

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,550
plus there's this beautiful idea of you

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,760
can build it once and sell it over and

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,750
over

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,540
over again how many of you are providing

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:40,120
client services to customers to clients

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,130
so I'm sure all of you are very familiar

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,930
with this idea of that you start a new

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,390
project and it's like starting from

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,620
scratch yes they have the same

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,750
conversations about educating them about

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,370
telling them about the process talking

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,870
to them about their goals you know you

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,030
basically start from a blank blank

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,800
canvas and from a creatives perspective

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,090
this is really exciting it's great

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,980
there's great things about it you can

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,140
learn a lot about different industries

00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,370
but the same time sometimes it feels

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,380
like just running on a hamster wheel

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,520
right like here's the next project doing

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,170
the same thing over here's the next

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,270
project doing the same thing over having

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,790
the same tiring conversations having the

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,380
same battles about you know there's a

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,780
reason why we limit it to two revisions

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,240
and you have to pay more if if we do

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,590
more with a product you're always

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,880
building on top of it you're always

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,470
iterating and improving and you're

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:30,700
selling it multiple times over and over

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:32,230
again so rewind to about 2010 I was in a

00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,540
meeting with a client and we're talking

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,310
about doing some work over the next few

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,290
months and he kind of mentioned in

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,450
passing like yeah you know just whenever

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,190
you get a chance maybe once a week just

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,110
send me you know like the little

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,090
thermometer of where we're at you know

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,280
from zero to 100 and he was referencing

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,740
kind of the the traditional like

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,630
donation thermometer where it starts at

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,010
zero and moves all the way up and it

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,990
kind of occurred to me like hey this is

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,360
a great idea like he just wanted a

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,970
visual indication of where we were

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,770
within the project are we 50% of the way

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,250
through or a 75% way through are we

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:09,730
almost done and this was actually a

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,890
significant point within the business a

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,810
lot of times we'd spent a lot of effort

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,270
working with clients just to keep them

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,670
aware of how things are going where we

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:21,760
are within the project no matter how

00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:24,640
hard we did we work to set dates to have

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,290
regular check-ins to send them updates

00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,730
we always got these emails like hey

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,960
how's it going you want to hop on the

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,260
phone let's just talk about where things

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,550
are at and it occurred to me this is

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,380
something that we could create really

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,140
easily in HTML and just send it to

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,810
clients and they would immediately know

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,850
at any point like oh we're 20% the way

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,200
through so this is the very first

00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,630
iteration of essential

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,670
the Status page that I sent every client

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,800
you can see this was obviously designed

00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,040
in 2010 so please don't hold it against

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,430
me

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,950
uh-huh and at first I just created

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,200
static HTML sent it off see do people

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,900
like it and general it was extremely

00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,980
helpful so the next step was hey it'll

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,930
be quicker if I turn this into a

00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,480
wordpress plugin so I did I built a

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,580
simple plugin shipped it off to the

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,350
WordPress repository and kind of didn't

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,720
think about it for a while

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,010
I had a little like PayPal donation link

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,870
that said buy me beer I might work on

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:21,280
the plug-in I think I made a total of 50

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:24,660
dollars in like the next four years and

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,150
they are at sat for a long time now in

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,400
2013 I think it was maybe late 2013 I

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,970
was attending a local WordPress meetup

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,980
and a gentleman and his wife were

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,160
speaking about a wordpress product that

00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,020
they just launched called learn - and

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,390
what I found out at the time is they'd

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,920
very quickly turned this side project

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,320
into a full-time business so there was

00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,140
three of them at the time and they're

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,030
able to stop working altogether on their

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,790
previous jobs and do this full-time it

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,070
occurred to me like wow there might be a

00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,730
market for this what what plugin would I

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:02,920
sell with back to the repository and

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:06,040
surprise project panorama had 12,000

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,900
active installs I thought well if I

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,720
improved it maybe people would actually

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,150
pay for it so I spent some time

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,610
rethinking the whole product talking

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,170
with our project manager Declan about

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,280
what sort of information would be useful

00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:22,390
to display the clients rebuilt it kind

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,940
of scratching our own itch and then

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,340
decided let's go ahead and try and sell

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,900
this and the result was almost

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,349
immediately people started buying it and

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,599
they have been ever since from that

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,780
point we've increased our product line

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,460
including five additional other smaller

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,520
plugins plus some pre-made ons for

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,500
panorama itself now the big takeaway

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,470
here is that the products are

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,510
significantly more profitable so even

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,070
though they're only you know they're

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,680
technically separate companies for legal

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,810
reasons and liability reasons but so the

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,910
plugin company probably only makes up a

00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,770
quarter of total

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,380
if you look at them combined but it only

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:05,190
takes six hours on average per week to

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,260
manage compared to 160 hours plus for

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,880
the service business so significantly

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,770
more possible or profitably

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,690
these are practically on autopilot we

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,210
choose to do improvements enhancements

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,650
here and there but they require so much

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:22,140
left less effort than the sides now I'm

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,080
talking about the benefits of creating a

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,760
product in the WordPress ecosystem

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,100
because there's a huge opportunity here

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,350
it's estimated that WordPress plugins

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,300
alone I'm not talking about themes or

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,530
other wordpress related products that

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,970
are out there but the plugins are low

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:41,310
nor estimated a one billion-dollar

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:45,210
market and it's growing if we look at

00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:48,000
some of the leaders in the space it's

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,070
hard to ignore Pippins plugins so they

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,160
are the the creators of easy digital

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,890
downloads restrict content Pro an

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,990
affiliate WP last year they reported two

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:01,440
point two six million dollars in revenue

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,840
and they're also growing but even some

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,950
of the more obscure plugins still do

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,110
really well so here's one of I don't

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,670
know a dozen membership plugins out

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,550
there called ultimate member that

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,680
publish their revenue so since 2015

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,170
they've generated almost million dollars

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,100
they do about 40 grandi per month on

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:25,140
average but even if you're not shooting

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,370
for millions of dollars a year maybe

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,890
you're just thinking about how do i

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,170
smooth out the ups and downs take some

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,050
of the burden away of trying to find

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,120
that next big project there's still

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,370
opportunity there to generate you know

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,920
very healthy amount of revenue off of

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,450
maybe one or a handful of plugins so

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,420
Vimeo graphi is another one this is a

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,890
very simple Vimeo gallery plug-in all it

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,090
does is integrate with Vimeo and then

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,010
show you some of your videos in the

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,770
gallery and that makes over six figures

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:56,010
a year with very little time involved

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,320
based on what the owner tells me here's

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:03,030
one that I had almost never heard of 0bs

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,980
CRM which is a wordpress crm plug-in

00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,040
from a company called epic plugins and

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,210
in the last year they went from making

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,649
you know a couple thousand dollars a

00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,079
month in sales to almost

00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:16,740
7,000 and again this is what I never

00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:19,019
heard of see the WordPress market it's

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,819
an interesting space because they're

00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,619
people there's so many people who have a

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:24,509
wordpress website you know what what is

00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:26,009
the stats now up to or like how many and

00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,019
what percent of the Internet's it's

00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:31,470
almost thirty right yeah so thirty

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,329
percent all websites powered by CMS use

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,100
WordPress which means there are millions

00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:37,829
of people who are out there who are

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,559
potential customers for any sort of

00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:43,199
product that you can create and a lot of

00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,220
them like the idea of being of owning

00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,230
the functionality I want this

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,879
functionality on my site I don't want to

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,519
pay some other person to host it on

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,779
their site so it's an instant tapping

00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,550
into a market because people will just

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:58,649
search for WordPress blank you know

00:11:53,550 --> 00:12:01,740
we're press blank plugin now usually

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:04,920
when I talk to people out creating a

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,929
product there's a lot of common barriers

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,160
love the idea I mean who doesn't love

00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,769
the idea especially if you're used to

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,629
service hourly business of being able to

00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:17,220
just wake up and like oh I've had sales

00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:18,959
made money was the common objections I

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:24,149
usually get is why I don't know what to

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,129
build I don't have time bit if I don't

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:29,370
have time to build it how am I actually

00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,929
going to get it built well I think

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,050
there's a variety of different ways you

00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:37,139
can approach it so obviously in my case

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,660
we started by scratching our own itch we

00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:42,089
had a problem we came up with the

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:45,199
solution for it and we figured other

00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,939
people might have the same problem now

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,379
initially what I expected is that we're

00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:51,209
only going to sell to designers

00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,829
developers you know other people in our

00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,720
situation who are offering client

00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:56,970
services are very similar model what I

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,499
found is a lot of people have very

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,809
similar problems in all sorts of

00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:02,879
industries so people have used our tool

00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:06,240
from everything to tracking Swim School

00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,850
progress for kids to tracking religious

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,129
pilgrimages to tracking creating

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,209
merchandise for Disney so I guess you

00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,410
know they're tracking all sorts of these

00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,490
different projects that I never had in

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,829
mind

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,569
I guess people all had this very similar

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,850
problem how do we keep everybody aware

00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:23,820
of how this project project is

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,140
progressing but maybe

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,020
you're lucky you don't have a whole lot

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,300
of issues well if you're doing client

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,950
services chances are your clients have

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,420
problems right especially if you're

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,250
doing something wordpress related you

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,990
might be putting together solutions for

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,060
clients because they have a problem that

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,210
they need solving and there's no reason

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:45,150
that you couldn't analyze that problem

00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,430
and create a more generic solution so

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,710
provided you don't have any issues with

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,970
work-for-hire in your contracts which if

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,950
you're not sure what it is come and ask

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,630
me later it's perfectly legal for you to

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,270
take some of your code you've written

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,810
for your clients turn it into a more

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:02,010
generic solution and sell it and that's

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,050
actually where one of our more recent

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,570
products came from basically we created

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,470
a barcode generator for WooCommerce

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,510
because we had a client they're spending

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:17,600
a lot of time manually generating and

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:20,490
uploading barcodes now back to 2013

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,740
towards the end of May if you were to

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:27,390
pick a caching plug-in in 2013 around

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,560
the end of May you're probably gonna

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:33,480
pick w3 total cache you can see it had

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,330
almost two and a half million downloads

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,040
is by far the most popular plug-in in

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,600
the category if you're not promoted the

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,280
caching plugin it basically makes your

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,700
website faster your WordPress website

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:47,310
faster so if you were going to get into

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,200
the premium plug-in market picking a

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,000
caching plug-in probably wouldn't have

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,590
been your first pick here's a free one

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,100
it does a lot it's popular people love

00:14:52,590 --> 00:15:02,610
it but WP rocket launched anyways and

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:06,900
since then they've sold almost sixty

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:09,480
thousand orders so here is a perfect

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,540
example of you can take a popular free

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,110
plug-in and offer a better version

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:18,050
that's paid and maybe even all you're

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,550
doing is just the the offering of

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,110
premium paid service because a lot of

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,150
the times when you're using something

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,310
like WP fashioned you have a significant

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,510
issue and you expect to get somebody to

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,310
get back to you right away maybe it's a

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,440
client site you might be out of luck

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,850
it's free you know I'm gonna get to it

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,320
when I get to it if I get to it all and

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,320
people are willing to pay for that

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,769
you might think through the plug-in

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:42,610
market or the WordPress market is

00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:45,740
saturated and there are a lot of players

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,980
so grab forums launched in August 28th

00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:52,999
of 2009 is one of the very first paid

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,819
WordPress plugins and it's probably this

00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:59,329
is a guess one the most popular if not

00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:02,329
the most popular premium form plug-in

00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:04,569
out there they have a really high market

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:09,069
saturation which might make you think

00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:11,749
foreign plugins not a good option but

00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:13,610
ninja forums is another option out there

00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:17,449
that does really well they took a

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,740
slightly different spin on on forums so

00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:20,959
they wanted to create a free version and

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,249
you pay for the add-ons and because they

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,879
have a different model it tracks a

00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:29,089
different type of people and there's

00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,639
caldera forums which also does really

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,439
really well and they're taking yet

00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:35,509
another spin on this they're basically

00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:38,480
looking at how can we create a plug-in

00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:40,699
that makes complex forms really easy

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,529
doing complex things with forums really

00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,629
easy like if you want a forum to create

00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:49,100
a post it's really easy with caldera

00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:50,449
forms not so easy the gravity forms so

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,829
there's plenty of space the WordPress

00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:54,500
market even in the places where you

00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,779
think that it's totally saturated all

00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,269
you have to do is take a unique spin at

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,490
it think about what's a slightly

00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,829
different need that people might have is

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,179
if you look at the numbers some of these

00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:07,459
big players they're making millions per

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,809
year if you just got a percentage of

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,270
that a small percentage that does

00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,409
amazing things for a service business as

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,289
far as smell it

00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:16,459
smoothing out the day to day so

00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:20,149
essentially I'm do what I'm talking

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:21,799
about is if you're looking for ideas one

00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:23,419
of the first things you can do is think

00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,549
about taking a different take on this

00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:27,260
existing successful product they've done

00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,049
the market testing for you they're

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,250
proving that there is a market here's an

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,260
opportunity people are willing to pay

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,570
for the solution you find just a

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,429
different way to go about it a slightly

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,950
different need you know or maybe your

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:41,120
tail to a smaller audience but a big

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,659
enough audience that you know is willing

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,840
to pay now you might be familiar with

00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:49,250
brands like fresh books harvests

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,540
QuickBooks some of you might use these

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,480
solutions

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:57,050
you may or may not be familiar with

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,350
sprouts invoices sprout invoices there's

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,310
a lot of the things that those other

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,320
software-as-a-service products do

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,550
it's basically an invoicing solution for

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,380
WordPress they're free and premium

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,230
versions it has a lot of things like the

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,900
time tracking automatic it's you know

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,010
exporting into an accounting system and

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,110
this plug-in does really really well

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,850
even though there's these established

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:23,870
leaders in the other and in the software

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:26,090
as-a-service space so making a wordpress

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,950
alternative to a software is another

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,320
really great opportunity that I don't

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,750
see a lot of people doing as I mentioned

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,420
earlier people like to have everything

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,130
connected to their own website they love

00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,630
the idea of having the invoice come from

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:42,430
their domain com

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,950
they get to own that data they're also a

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,750
much smaller you know rather than paying

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,370
50 bucks a month you might be paying 50

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,040
bucks a year and that can be a big

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,180
difference to a small business owner

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,680
plus another thing that people love

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,030
about WordPress is you can stitch these

00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,490
plugins together maybe you want a

00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,140
comprehensive client portal that does

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,270
everything it does the invoicing the

00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,820
project management the contact relation

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,440
management you know the emailing all

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,970
these different things people liked to

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,560
have those put together and create these

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,760
really complex automations I mean the

00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,770
things that I've seen people do is

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,570
ingenious so they have a WooCommerce

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,490
project that when you purchase it it

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,410
sends you know the first invoice which

00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,610
then creates a project when the project

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,050
reaches a certain point automatically

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,460
generates another invoice these are all

00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,870
things that are really difficult to do

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,090
when you're trying to tie together

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,920
different peoples third-party systems

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:32,570
but when it's all built in WordPress it

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:36,320
becomes much easier you can also think

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,880
about creating premium add-ons so you

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,820
don't have to start from the ground up

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,670
you don't have to build your own giant

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,870
behemoth plug-in in order to start

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,210
generating some of this reoccurring

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,640
revenue of this product revenue so will

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,860
commerce probably one of the most well

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,440
known plug into the WordPress space most

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,610
you've probably heard of WooCommerce not

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,540
sure how many of you've heard of sky

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:01,160
Virge so they've created 66 WooCommerce

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,920
extensions which is allow them to

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,220
generate a team of 22 members and

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,020
also contribute to the WooCommerce car

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,300
so just by creating these small little

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,950
individual pieces of functionality to

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,660
WooCommerce which is an incredibly

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,220
complex piece of software they're able

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,520
to generate to create this really big

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,520
team

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:28,790
similarly real big plugins which Kyle

00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,470
Mauer in the back is involved in I have

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,810
a very similar business model they have

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,540
some complete standalone plugins but

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,850
they also create a lot of add-on plugins

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,110
for other popular platforms and in

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,490
talking to Kyle one of the things he

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,920
mentioned is that they're able to

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,900
identify these little specific needs

00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,940
that a handful of users maybe bigger

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,970
than a handful but a specific group of

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:53,240
users need and it's a small enough group

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,230
that doesn't make sense in core but

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,420
there's enough people where there's

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,770
actual market for it and they can put

00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,170
together and release a plug-in very

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,760
quickly and the support is actually

00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,110
pretty low because it's very specific

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,520
it's like in the individual piece of

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,730
functionality it's not like you're

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,290
trying to support this massive codebase

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,460
that does a lot of different things you

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,650
really only have to focus on that small

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,450
thing it's a rather than focusing on one

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:18,530
big product they create a lot of small

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,660
products and that generates a lot of

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,700
extra revenue there's a lot of companies

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,360
that do this so I talked about gravity

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,400
forms earlier there's gravity view which

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,320
this kind of displays data that's been

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,060
submitted through a gravity form which

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,930
is a contact form gravity flow which is

00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,760
basically except more advanced workflows

00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,950
for gravity forms so if you want a

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,480
multi-state form that sort of thing and

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,130
then gravity Wiz which is like a jetpack

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,500
you know like a lot of little different

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,060
things you can enable on forms now I

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,680
think the the interesting thing about

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,260
these plugins is these are all for

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,150
gravity forms I've mentioned to other

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,000
form plugins that do not have these

00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,650
capabilities so here you know people are

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,750
willing to pay for these these are

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,490
already marketable plugins you know that

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,320
people are paying for those other form

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,050
plugins so one of you can leave today

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:11,000
create the Cal their version of gravity

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:12,380
view and have a successful product you

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,860
can also look at taking over abandon

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,450
plugins so wordfence which is a security

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,549
plugin is security we

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,590
press security company will publish a

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,659
list of all the abandoned plugins in the

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,240
WordPress repository along with how many

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:29,090
active installations there are here we

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,909
go SEO slugs hasn't been updated since

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:35,179
2007 somehow still has 10,000 active

00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:37,820
installations a lot of times at this

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,889
point this plugin author has no interest

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,299
in maintaining this plugin but they

00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:43,490
might be interested in having somebody

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:46,210
take it over so you could reach out to

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:50,149
them and say hey I love your plug-in and

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:51,860
I would love to see it succeed do you

00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:53,870
mind if I take it over and they some

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,700
people will be happy to hand it over to

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,000
you so now you've immediately got in a

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,529
market ten thousand people who have the

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,090
plug-in installed and if you release an

00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:03,740
update they're likely to update it as

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,620
well and you can decide to do a handful

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,600
of things with that information you can

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,639
either use that to try and build a list

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,620
and market to them a different SEO

00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,990
plug-in or you could try and create a

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:20,179
premium version of the same plug-in and

00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:21,440
get them to upgrade so the next question

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:26,389
I often get is what am I going to build

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,889
it well if it's solving a client's hitch

00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:32,210
then part of its gonna be on a client

00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:34,100
time which is kind of nice you could try

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,470
and set a ten percent time in your

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,360
company or two yourself if you're a sole

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,889
proprietor this is kind of the Google

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,750
idea where ten percent of your time

00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:43,370
you're allowed to work on whatever

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,580
project you want that's how things like

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,049
Gmail and Google Maps came into play

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,440
there's always nights and weekends if

00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:54,799
you're a night owl but there was one

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,630
idea that that I really loved so Anthony

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,889
Montalbano for ember Detroit told me

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,440
once that they had a company retreat

00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:03,470
they just spent weekend working on a

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,059
brand new product so everybody went to a

00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,470
hotel I think and they just you know

00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,360
basically did a hackathon or their own

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,429
version of a Startup Weekend just to try

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,659
and get something you know started in

00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:18,649
those couple days and if none of those

00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:20,210
things seem like they're gonna work then

00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:22,909
you might be looking at hiring outside

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,429
help in which case you might be

00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:29,059
wondering how do I hire somebody to

00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:32,090
actually get this built so what I

00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:35,059
recommend especially if you're

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:38,179
a business owner doing service work is

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:40,159
create a faux client so you do these

00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:41,269
sort of things you work on these sort of

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,600
projects with your clients all the time

00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:47,659
so treat this product like a client you

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,700
know give it a name give it a company

00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,769
name give it some details actually take

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,600
the time to write out a proposal so you

00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:55,249
know exactly what you're building the

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,539
thing is if it's always just something

00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:58,100
you're like I think I would like to do

00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:00,470
this someday I'm gonna work on this soon

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,730
it's too vague it doesn't feel real you

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,769
have to help hold yourself accountable

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,809
just like it was an actual products

00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,860
otherwise you just keep actual client

00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,389
otherwise it'll just keep being pushed

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,850
over and over further and further away

00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:12,950
and even if you don't plan on building

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:15,619
it yourself these sort of things make it

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,320
really easy to hire a developer to do it

00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:19,340
for you or a team to do it for you

00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,509
because if you just call somebody up and

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,299
say hey I want to create you know the

00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:25,820
gravity view for Caldera forms they'll

00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,230
be like okay like exactly one-to-one

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,580
let's talk about the details there's a

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,159
lot of back and forth that goes but if

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,240
you give them a detailed specification

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,999
it's really easy for them to give you a

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,610
quote and start moving and I would even

00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:39,289
go so far as to sketch up some diagrams

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,450
gets up some interfaces of how this

00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,129
would work so we really like to do paper

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,289
prototyping in my agency I recommend

00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:47,090
doing that as well because you know you

00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,309
don't have to create thing pretty just

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,690
anything just you know first you see

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,999
this and then you click on this then you

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,679
see this goes a long way to

00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:59,059
communicating what exactly are we gonna

00:25:54,679 --> 00:26:00,919
do here so at some point you're noting

00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,730
side do I want to in-house this or

00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,869
outsource it and I got some tips there

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,799
you can either hire somebody if you're

00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:08,419
gonna hire somebody who you're an

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,879
outsource it you could hire somebody

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:14,539
codable upwork.com jobs that word press

00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:16,429
that net or freelancer com I'll say the

00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:19,039
one thing about hiring people it's not

00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:20,779
something to be ashamed of if it's

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,720
something you could do yourself there's

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:25,730
two plugins that we've done that started

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,990
by hiring somebody to do a bulk of the

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,179
work and we kind of finish it up at the

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:32,090
end just cuz it's sometimes it's hard

00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,320
just to get get the project started but

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,330
it's a lot easier to just tie up the

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,600
little details you could also think

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,129
about partnering maybe you can find a

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,960
developer who doesn't have an idea or

00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:43,159
doesn't want to handle the support they

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,170
don't want to handle the marketing and

00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,940
you can split responsibilities say

00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,680
I'm going to do the marketing I'm going

00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,480
to do all the support all you have to do

00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,040
is build it do the fun part or the part

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,850
you like and I'll do the part that I

00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,750
like and you could split the

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,320
responsibilities and then you can also

00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,450
beg

00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:04,040
which probably won't work but I needed a

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:06,590
third option so now the next thing I'd

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,610
recommend is is starting small I think a

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:12,110
lot of times you look at the I bring a

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,990
new idea into the world whether it's a

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,520
product or a service and there's kind of

00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,110
this feeling that it needs to be like

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,820
this big revolutionary thing because

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,800
that's what than what's in the news you

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:25,370
know the exciting startups the ones that

00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:27,460
are you know disrupting a new industry

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:31,940
you know it's the next it's uber for

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:33,350
whatever pizza and if it's not something

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,410
big and newsworthy then it's not worth

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,360
doing at all but in reality starting

00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,130
small makes so much more sense because

00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,540
you learned so much just getting

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,420
something out there does anybody care

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,830
about this and your perception of what

00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,240
you think is important is going to be

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,450
very different than what your customers

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,680
think is important and there's a quote

00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,030
that I love from Reed Hoffman the

00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,410
founder of LinkedIn he said if you're

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,050
not embarrassed by the first version of

00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:00,080
your product you've launched too late is

00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,490
absolutely the case the first version of

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,910
panorama which is a project management

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:07,220
plug-in didn't even have logins like you

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,540
couldn't assign somebody to a project it

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,970
was let you sent them a page and that

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,440
was it and a lot of - were like really

00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,760
like is this done

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,800
did you like accidentally launch too

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,880
soon but it at least validated that

00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,950
people are interested and that this

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,110
feature was really important so seven

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,120
days later we had logins and that's the

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,640
sort of thing you'll figure out the

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,660
things that you think are important

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,950
aren't always important and there's

00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,440
things you don't think are important

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,760
that are really important so just

00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,590
getting something out there will teach

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,910
you so much I think a lot of times what

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,220
holds people back is just kind of this

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,960
general fear that we have maybe it's

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,190
fear of rejection like what if I release

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,260
this I do all this work and nothing

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,120
happens nobody buys it or maybe like

00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,620
sometimes I have fear of success like

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,450
what if this does really well like I

00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,100
can't handle it like my life is kind of

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,770
crazy as it is like how am I gonna

00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,200
handle a lot more support or like you're

00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,450
trying to hire people to manage all the

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,119
things that are going on

00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,039
but I would say that I mean to me

00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,590
there's nothing scarier than looking

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,239
back in ten years and saying like I

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,590
totally missed this opportunity I wish I

00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:10,929
would have just liked seeing does

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,789
anybody interested in this thing that I

00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:14,970
think is interesting could I have you

00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:23,159
know generate any money any sales

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:24,609
releasing a product so that's all I got

00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,929
hopefully I've given you enough

00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:28,200
information so that you can actually

00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:30,999
come up with the idea of a product or

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,879
inspired to actually get something out

00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:45,850
there you know it's really small thank

00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:48,899
you yes yes do you have any specific

00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,899
questions around pricing models

00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,320
I think is gravity

00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:12,780
sure yeah so pricing is interesting in

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,850
the WordPress space because it's kind of

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,039
all over the place so when I first

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,740
launched panoramas what was common is

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,580
you you buy the plug-in once and you

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:26,190
have it for a lifetime and sometimes you

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,990
would have a restriction per site so you

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:31,909
know you can buy it for one site or

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:34,320
unlimited sites and that's very much

00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:37,289
change we're now you can expect annual

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,960
pricing I think most of the time people

00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:42,030
expect reoccurring pricing now so if you

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,640
buy something most people think it's

00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,870
either gonna be six months two years

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,870
you're gonna have access to that license

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,210
before you have to renew now typically

00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,789
renewals now some people don't offer any

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,350
discount and renewals other people will

00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,299
do like a fifty percent discount which

00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,919
is what we're currently doing and a lot

00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,900
of people are moving towards automatic

00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,940
renewals so you don't have to manually

00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,159
go in at the end of the year and pay

00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,289
again for your license to renew it'll

00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,900
just automatically renew now in terms of

00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:11,850
price points it really depends on the

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,130
plugin so I've seen anything as low as

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:17,250
like nine dollars if it's like a small

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:20,520
plugin or small an add-on to five

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:23,280
hundred dollars sometimes more the other

00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,140
bigger question is should I do a

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,870
freemium where the core plugin is free

00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,750
and you're selling a lot of add-ons and

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:33,750
or should it just be you know you pay to

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,520
get the full version you know so easy

00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,470
digital downloads for a long time was

00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,409
kind of the poster child for how

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,940
freemium could work but Pippin and this

00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:44,150
team have been very transparent and

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,070
saying that it's the least profitable

00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:50,490
plugin that they have that the amount of

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:51,960
support for the freemium model just

00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,140
doesn't seem to make sense and they

00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,330
wished that it had just been in all you

00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,909
know it's premium or nothing sort of

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:03,919
plug-in they answer your question are

00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:03,919
you any more questions yes

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:19,529
yeah like what are some SAS solutions

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,390
that you could make like a wordpress

00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:27,330
version of so certainly you know so we

00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,250
did project management I think another

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:32,970
service that's getting really popular is

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:35,309
inbound marketing platforms like hub spa

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,350
or Marketo a sharp spring matthew was

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:40,260
talking about them next door there

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,669
really isn't a good WordPress hosted

00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,140
solution for something like that maybe

00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,909
you couldn't replicate the features

00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,720
one-to-one but I bet you people would

00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:49,980
pay for that really just think about any

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,740
monthly service that people pay for a

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,350
time tracking you know people pay a lot

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,690
of money for toggle and harvest and that

00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,820
sort of thing just so that users can you

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,370
know track their time I'm sure that's

00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,730
something that that people would pay for

00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,730
for WordPress

00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:22,970
in school Excel application

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,150
created somewhere else and they take

00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,150
that

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,990
yeah I think that's absolutely an avenue

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,000
you could take so the question was could

00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,770
you take like something that's built in

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,260
excel like an Excel document maybe that

00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:44,840
has complex formulas or B lookups that

00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,280
sort of thing and turn that into a

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,049
wordpress product and I think absolutely

00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,919
if there's a business case for it if if

00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:50,840
it's the sort of thing that people would

00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,059
find useful then yeah somebody would

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,429
probably find find it useful on a

00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:56,870
wordpress site it would probably be

00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:58,580
really easy to pass their developer and

00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,490
say I just want this to work on a

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,740
website and I believe that people even

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,929
charge like you can buy premium Excel

00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,650
templates too so it seems like there's a

00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:08,650
market yeah

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,800
yes so that's a really good point

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,360
so internationalization is basically

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,150
building to plug in such a way that you

00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,700
can translate it and I think that is a

00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:32,940
must do because you'd be shocked at how

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:35,159
big the global WordPress market is I

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,290
haven't run the numbers specifically but

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,409
I would imagine that the u.s. is

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:44,510
probably only half of total sales maybe

00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:46,890
even less so sales in my business so

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,970
yeah there's a huge overseas market so

00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,800
you want to make sure it's translatable

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,060
that's actually really easy to do once

00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,679
you know how to do it any competent

00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,770
developer should be able to do it as far

00:34:52,679 --> 00:35:00,900
as weird requests I've gotten all sorts

00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:02,880
of weird ones people who wanted to like

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,110
they have this unrealistic expectation

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,940
about what a plug-in does they're like

00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:09,870
well does it integrate with like my

00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:21,210
smart fridge like no what would it even

00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:23,640
do no generally no no backlash in the

00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:26,220
code itself from people who actually

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,180
know how to look at the code there's a

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,070
lot of people who are quick to blame

00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,360
code if something doesn't work right

00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,360
like there could be a plug-in conflict

00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,880
like sorry Yoast but I've had the most

00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,280
issues with your plugin him and they oh

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,140
because Yoast is Yoast SEO is such a

00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,750
popular plugin they always blame the

00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,950
small guys like well Yoast SEO is

00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,920
installed on all these different sites

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:49,440
and you know it works fine there so you

00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,790
know it's Yoast problem you know what I

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,790
