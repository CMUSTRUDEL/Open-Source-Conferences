Description: 
	Help make the world a better place with WordPress.
Assisting organizations that make this world a better place is highly inspiring and satisfying. But that can’t be the only reward when you give your professional best. In a nutshell: Birgit shares how to work with nonprofits and how to bring them into the best light online.
She discusses how you can build a donor/member-oriented website and how to incorporate the organization’s “bucket list” within the realities of budgets and capabilities.
You will learn about the wide range of online needs for various types of nonprofits, share info about plugins, and learn about tools to build useful solutions. You’ll walk away with the resources to connect with other nonprofit technologists and services.
Just because the organization is a nonprofit doesn’t mean you can’t make a living building effective websites with a notable online presence.
