Title: Birgit Pauli-Haack: WordPress for Nonprofits - Your Work for the Greater Good
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	Help make the world a better place with WordPress.
Assisting organizations that make this world a better place is highly inspiring and satisfying. But that can’t be the only reward when you give your professional best. In a nutshell: Birgit shares how to work with nonprofits and how to bring them into the best light online.
She discusses how you can build a donor/member-oriented website and how to incorporate the organization’s “bucket list” within the realities of budgets and capabilities.
You will learn about the wide range of online needs for various types of nonprofits, share info about plugins, and learn about tools to build useful solutions. You’ll walk away with the resources to connect with other nonprofit technologists and services.
Just because the organization is a nonprofit doesn’t mean you can’t make a living building effective websites with a notable online presence.

founded my NP tech projects in 2015 and

00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,920
we are programs called WP for good your

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,739
chest art of starting it out but it's

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:56,649
more hosting it's also pew a fine it's

00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:58,840
you can send me send emails in those

00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:01,390
questions there that you know that your

00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,760
developer that abandoned the nonprofit

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,770
before can't answer anymore or something

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,030
like that yeah so get in touch and

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:19,420
that's pretty much it

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:24,909
yes so how many of you are consultants

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:27,939
for nonprofits okay that's $6 yeah and

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:32,110
how many of you work at nonprofits and

00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:33,520
manage the website okay if that's the

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,850
same kind of thing okay they're a little

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,040
bit more so I'm gonna switch it around a

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,950
bit but I think it's interesting for

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,119
everybody to know before we go into the

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,399
nitty-gritty I want to make you aware

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,979
especially your consultants just because

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,840
it's non-profit doesn't mean you need to

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:59,170
work for free I have found many

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,659
consultants that are more profits not by

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:05,640
design but just kind of how it works out

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:08,229
with around you and the second one is

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,470
that when you talk about nonprofit

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:14,080
websites it's all about online

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,120
fundraising yeah so and we get to that

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:23,090
part how do I come to that that we can

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:25,760
to point that out somos corporate

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,140
organizations can be divided in a lot of

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,760
different kind of categories like

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:34,069
maturity level or something like that

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:37,549
for today we only talk about technology

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:41,209
maturity level or adoption level and the

00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:43,450
other one is size and we have the two

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,420
groups there when we talk about

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,220
technology adoption level and why is it

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,880
important to talk about that because

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:56,569
your solution that you have in mind for

00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:00,950
a certain problem might not feel fit the

00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:02,810
nonprofit's need or you kind of pipe a

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,440
little bit too too much that you can

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,360
choose so it's really important to

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,370
listen to the organizational structure

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,299
the people that technology that they use

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:17,510
in the skill level when you start

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:22,700
suggesting column solutions because that

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,769
kind of needs to fit it so in 10 and

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,400
that's the logo of that and 10 is the

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:30,079
first resource for you Vietnam profit or

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,680
consultant is the nonprofit technology

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:34,250
Network and they have published a it's a

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,250
mouthful

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,650
let me think sir the intends technology

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,280
staffing and adoption report and it was

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,380
published last year in May and they and

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,359
the nonprofit's that kind of sending the

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,970
information put themselves in those

00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,620
categories with the struggling mean

00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,109
struggling means a struggling

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,690
organization technology-wise is it has a

00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:58,599
failing infrastructure they spend a lot

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,560
of time creating workarounds and

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,109
duplicate have a lot of duplicate

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:08,150
efforts and if any money is spent on

00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:10,400
technology its to replacement so the are

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,540
functioning nonprofits or the next level

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:19,729
up so to speak if they keep the lights

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:23,080
on they have basic systems in place the

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:27,050
leadership of those technology decisions

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,020
based on efficiency not so much on after

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,530
input from consultants or from staff

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,400
that's a fun

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,660
and then the operating nonprofit

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,180
leadership snake leadership makes

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,990
decisions after they look at industry

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,420
standards or best practices they also

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,670
ask the staff and consultants for input

00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,890
and then there is the leading

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,010
organization and the linearization there

00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:54,110
are innovators you know they look at

00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,580
technology being an investment into

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,000
their mission and sometimes their

00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,280
mission is to lower barriers technology

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,320
barriers there and use all the new

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,550
technology that's available there are

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:11,660
also the ones that are more susceptible

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:15,350
to trying new stuff out testing things

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,690
coming up with a plan kind of let's try

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,810
it out see how it works and if it works

00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,090
learn from it and then make it better so

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:28,340
the more agile nonprofit pretty much

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:31,640
here but don't get it wrong so a small

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:36,290
nonprofit is here qualified as with

00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:38,240
revenue under 1 million dollars and if

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,090
you're a small nonprofit does not mean

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,090
you're struggling it does not mean it

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,250
can actually mean that you are very much

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,240
using technology to scale the operation

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,070
without having to scale the operation so

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,740
to speak that you don't have to hire

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,870
more staff who have more office or

00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,470
something like that and it also doesn't

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,000
mean when a large organization has a lot

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,950
of staff and a lot of technology that

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,640
they're actually using that technology

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:14,620
very efficiently so there is a you all

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:18,080
kind of solve some of that so that so

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:22,100
but the question is do not profits hire

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,350
consultants and in which area yeah you

00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,890
can see this can you all see very

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,729
slightly

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,110
yeah so the and this is from the

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,000
technology report that's the only

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,010
graphic I think that I have maybe I have

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,760
another one

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:42,639
so all four levels of nonprofits hire

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,520
consultants and

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,169
it just is a little bit more in the

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,930
functioning operating and leading than

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:52,270
in the smaller ones but they some of

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:57,069
them are actually hire consultants all

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,740
the time or very often so in consultants

00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:03,219
is a bigger term in this report it's not

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,879
just web developer or online stuff it's

00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:14,349
also an operation networking in these

00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:16,840
but so as the end of this kind of

00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,340
section here it's important that you

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,620
listen to the needs of your nonprofit

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,099
it's important to the problem that you

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,379
solved and also to see who are the

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:29,919
stakeholders because we all you might

00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:33,819
have already heard this ok we gotta have

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,169
an app yeah and when you have the when

00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,960
you're asked and so what you want the

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:39,879
app to do well it's on the iPhone yeah

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:45,159
so it's kind of there's a lot of shiny

00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:48,339
object syndrome where and it kind of you

00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,180
need to navigate that a little bit to

00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:54,360
kind of say ok is there a need for

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,599
technology improvements and your website

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,599
changes there

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,850
technology in the 1-1 fraud is also when

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,580
you have a struggling or function

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,450
organization that you work with the a

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,100
big problem is scoping a project and so

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:24,110
if they come to you we want to have some

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:27,240
website work done or we want to do this

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,610
integration with some other service or

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,290
something like that that you are not

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,200
wearing as a consultant enough

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,420
information yeah so you as a

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,870
professional would need to go in and do

00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,150
the discovery what's called discovery

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,860
yourself and of course they don't have

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,720
it in the budget because they didn't

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:54,210
even heard that word before in in that

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:56,400
in that context but there are there's

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,860
help out there so local Community

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,740
Foundation have what it's called

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,800
capacity building grants there are

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,640
sometimes between a thousand and five

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,160
thousand dollars and local nonprofits

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,720
can apply for it we're certain of course

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,530
they have these requirements some of the

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,460
requirements but that gives you actually

00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:23,250
and there's actually four that part that

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,550
you can run planning and scoping a

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:30,030
project and then go out for a bid so to

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,920
speak as a non-profit go to a consultant

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,050
and say I have this project can you help

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,330
me scope it out and then make a little

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,370
project plan for that just for that part

00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,590
go to the Community Foundation and say

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,790
okay we need I don't know two thousand

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,580
dollars or something like that

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,320
to scope a project and to plan it out

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,410
and to deliverability

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,160
the deliverable about that would be that

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,260
you give them a specifications and RFP

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,730
pretty much that they can then go out

00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,800
and bid of course that gives you also an

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,960
in into that nonprofit if you haven't

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,300
worked with them before in terms of

00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,780
trust because you know that so in and

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,470
out so if your bid is not totally off

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,740
the charts

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,860
yeah it's likely that you actually get

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,860
it

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:25,770
that's local community foundations yes

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:30,390
yeah I don't have you haven't I also run

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:33,560
a local nonprofit technology Club and we

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:37,370
have next ones next next weeks actually

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:48,810
applying for grants so yeah so I'm

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:50,880
putting the resources together so let's

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,339
talk about those so that's the first

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,520
myth you don't have to work for free if

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,680
you work for nonprofits as a consultant

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,070
and they don't want you to either but

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,630
they're also not saying okay if you

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,870
offer it if you offer to volunteer

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:11,130
something keep in mind that if you go

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:14,400
away or they're able to continue your

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,170
work yeah so that it's not just a spark

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,550
and then you go away and then they have

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,430
to look for somebody else because they

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,110
can't handle it yeah so be careful what

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,510
you kind of put yourself in there so the

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,700
second myth is when you're talking down

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,040
profit websites it's all about the money

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,690
it's all about donation from donors so

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:38,970
let's put this into the online giving

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:40,260
now the total giving in 2010 in the

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:45,000
United States was three hundred and

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:48,630
eighty billion dollars of that seventy

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,550
two percent come from individuals

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:55,200
that's a roughly two hundred and eighty

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:58,770
billion and of an online giving was

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,240
twenty seven point eight billion that's

00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:05,820
2010 percent of all the giving is

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,040
through online so there's a whole 90

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,980
percent of the individual giving that

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,709
does not happen online so that changes

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:17,580
the perspective on how the nonprofit

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:25,650
perceives the work on the website if it

00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:28,980
is for online donations however that

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:33,390
being said online giving

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,540
growth is growing fast nonprofits

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:41,570
received an average of 28 percent more

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:46,280
online gifts in 2017 than in 2016

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:50,280
28% more so it grows and once the giving

00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:55,440
account for 18 percent of the revenue

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,790
online in 2017 so it's not it's not at

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,820
the forefront

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,130
who knows what what's still the biggest

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:11,280
moneymaker is in terms of activity

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:14,180
outreach to donors Direct Mail yeah the

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,830
most expensive part is still a lot of

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,200
return on investment for nonprofits it's

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:25,470
still very much the big moneymaker

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:27,870
yeah yes it has festivals need to do

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,520
with a generation that has standards all

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:34,460
their lives and that's also the

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:36,990
generation that so it's the generation

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,960
older than boomers a Boomer older

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,180
boomers and so they called mature I

00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,390
think if I have to wait that long to be

00:13:42,180 --> 00:14:02,430
called mature I've stopped doing it

00:13:44,390 --> 00:14:05,700
being it I I don't

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:07,710
yeah the the impact part I don't but

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,940
these are studies that are coming out

00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:14,820
who intend and FML benchmarks so this

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,730
one actually comes from a study that was

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:23,460
just released in March from m+ our

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:27,510
benchmark I have the the URL on the on

00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:31,080
the site yeah so the growth rate is is

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:34,170
really good yeah for online giving so

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,450
it's definitely on the radar but there

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,750
are other goals that nonprofits have on

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,430
the web for their websites here a big

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,940
goal is raising awareness there

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,300
the organization actually exists also

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,370
have issues that there are nonprofit

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,920
cares about or the yeah or they're

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,170
helping us or increasing donor retention

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,089
it is a little bit different than

00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,480
finding donors or a donor attention

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,870
right now

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,209
an average it's 38% it's just not

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,160
particular for this donor retention so

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:09,029
these are all technical terms that are

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,000
not website or WordPress specific yeah

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:14,040
there are nonprofit specific and you

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,790
talking about the language of my profits

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,250
is really a PI donor retention is if the

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:24,480
the donors were donated this year how

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:28,200
many of those donate next year and if

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,350
it's a first-time donor it's only 20

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,300
I think 28% retention so it's a

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:37,170
first-time donor in the first year only

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:40,980
28% donor in second year yeah so a

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:43,560
website that keeps donors and connected

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,850
and tells the story whatever what's

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,209
happening with the money that's

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,370
definitely a higher on the list of goals

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:55,650
for the full website another one is

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:57,630
volunteer recruitment no nonprofit or

00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,580
there are a lot of nonprofits that would

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,589
not function without the volunteers

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,110
it's the biggest resource that they have

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:07,860
an organizing volunteer management it's

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,709
definitely high on the list on helping

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:17,400
on having an impact on their nonprofits

00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:20,580
bottom line and take fundraising online

00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,260
is certainly a goal and we talked about

00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,279
and we gonna talk about it a little bit

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,220
further

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,900
it's retweeted donor information

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,329
recurring contributions and also

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,400
memberships and and that's where you can

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:36,480
also talk about conversions and this

00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,770
ecommerce talk and then of course

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,730
peer-to-peer fundraising

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,730
there's no questionnaire

00:16:50,490 --> 00:17:01,329
well this might not be exclusive yes

00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:03,579
yeah so mary says that her organization

00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:05,650
has none of those goals pretty much and

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,209
if they're going the wrong way so my

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:27,459
question to you back is what are the

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:29,140
goals of the organization but I think

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,850
that's goes into the public awareness

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,010
things yeah I think so

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,559
it says she said organization that has

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,870
resources what's happening about what's

00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:41,470
happening where whom to talk to so sorry

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,840
Pharaoh kind of a curation kind of way

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,290
to do this and that's how you actually

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,020
raise public awareness that you set up

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:52,270
that's a little well now I need to speed

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,760
up a bit okay so the Minimum Viable

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:57,220
Product is our WordPress website for

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,040
well as a reference but any website

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,410
actually is you need some pages you need

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,880
a subscription form for email you need

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,280
an email marketing and your new donut

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,770
yeah that's a minimal Viable Product

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,990
there so any nonprofits or the pages or

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,640
kind of what services what do we do who

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,429
are the people yeah

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,090
Henry static and then the rest is an

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:20,860
email let's talk about a little bit

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,250
about the donate button if somebody

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,350
comes to the website and says oh I wanna

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,179
do it and somebody on the phone says go

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,549
to our website blah blah blah support

00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,290
and then click on the donate button yeah

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,880
and this website that's on the screen

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,460
now I have a hard time to kind of

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,040
locating it because it's very busy right

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:43,929
not at the first and my favorite sounds

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:47,679
very good how about this one really busy

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:51,070
right it's hard to see so we're getting

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,429
closer alright okay so top right is a

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,960
good place for a donate button and then

00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:58,810
there's another one

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,320
that has Kill Bill it's about the

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:06,310
restoration Florida Everglades and and

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,500
they have two methods to stand out more

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,510
layers on top the donation button is in

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,610
the navigation bar but with a different

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,280
color so that's where I would actually

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:18,220
look for it yeah and the other one is on

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,850
the top left side to take the action to

00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:25,470
kill the bill but there are two cards

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,910
for action so and that brings into the

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,940
challenges of a non-profit event if you

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,980
worked worked with a non-profit building

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,710
a website you have a lot of stakeholders

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,410
I need to go through those afterwards we

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:43,960
have time for special yeah I get the

00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:46,120
evil eye there so you have plenty of

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,800
stakeholders you have the board of

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,500
directors you have the staff you have

00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:57,730
the executive director and then you have

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:59,340
the cousin of the board chairman they

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:04,930
have no time for blogging or

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:06,820
storytelling and that last point I pick

00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,010
up and say okay let's change those

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,720
processes if you go to the next level on

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,240
our WordPress website the next level is

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,140
actually blogging but they don't have

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,810
time to blog

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,120
yeah but the have time and you need to

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,560
observe this and if that's true it's an

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:27,370
assumption that I make that they have

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:32,770
time to post on Facebook there is time

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:34,840
to spend hours on a newsletter and the

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,670
stories told in the newsletters are fun

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,050
fabulous yeah if I get a paper

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,770
newsletter from a nonprofit organization

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,630
I threw it in the recycle bin

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,730
but if I get an email newsletter I

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,050
definitely scroll through that and see

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,950
you okay what what are they up to you

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:53,230
can I help them with anything so if they

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,410
spent that time that they create the

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,600
email newsletter and rethink the process

00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:02,170
and say okay let's blog those stories

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:06,030
and then use the RSS feed which is all a

00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:09,430
syndication see and Belgium does that

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:11,680
two and a half social media buttons

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:15,940
share it out yeah then you get actually

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,650
many many birds for the same time of the

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,940
same amount of time and there's a

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,850
training issue there's a transition

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,160
issue but it definitely works so this is

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,430
a newsletter from an A+ Press Club from

00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,400
the neighbors festival and there are all

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:32,590
staffs from newsletters newspapers book

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,270
writers magazine writers you have the

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,850
first kind of few times I worked with

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,680
them there is a drop of writers that

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,850
doesn't write yeah I didn't have

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,430
anything to post on the website so I

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:47,080
kind of helped them to get into the feel

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,280
okay yeah you need to go down that yeah

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,010
and everybody was kind of more a

00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:54,730
blogging yes gets all the crazies out of

00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:57,400
the woodwork not the case so we set up

00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,190
the newsletter they blog yeah and then

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,010
once a month we put the RSS feed

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,890
together and send it out by email to the

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:09,250
members and that's the newsletter how it

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:12,040
looks this is their spikes on the Google

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,290
Analytics yeah so kind of tempis all the

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:18,520
him news articles out everybody goes to

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:20,560
the website yeah and so now the members

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,240
can't say I don't know that we did first

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,950
I don't know that you wrote this yeah I

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,590
didn't know about the new event it was

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,830
all there and they looked at it and all

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,680
of a sudden that it was also that the

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:36,550
local people that new member recruitment

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:39,790
end up and the starters in the community

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:42,930
about oh that's really something a club

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:46,210
that I need to join yeah made it really

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,940
working for that so that's one thing to

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:52,120
scale up the operation the next one is

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:56,890
um so online fundraising then - that is

00:22:52,120 --> 00:23:02,710
really ecommerce and you can yeah all

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:05,290
the best practices apply so in donors it

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,810
own it works six times better that the

00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:11,320
bonus pays on the website and donates

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:13,960
online then going up wait ooh another

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,960
website yeah so having your third party

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,970
donor management system integrators

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,520
WordPress is really really important

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:25,300
yeah and that they stay there also this

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:29,410
traction free checkout pages is so

00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:32,950
important with our attention span kind

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:35,170
of failing more and more if I get

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,580
distracted by one more link or something

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,280
like that from my Maker my dosha

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,680
donation I'm not hitting the button and

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,690
this needs to happen there needs to be

00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:49,450
it and the other one have a clear

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:52,900
process frictionless seamless and then

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:58,410
up make the up sale on the Sankhya page

00:23:52,900 --> 00:24:01,300
so upsell is a term out of the ecommerce

00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:03,370
thing and when you for instance try to

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,280
get a domain name at GoDaddy you have a

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,200
lot of upset yeah but you can also do

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,480
this in the nonprofit world where you

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,700
say it doesn't have to be another

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,200
donation but it can be share this with

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,540
your friends and have the sharing button

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,360
sale or do you want to make this our

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:24,010
bouncy donation this is the time to do

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:27,340
it so that's the menu stay in touch of

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,620
course you can just have them so your

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,350
email newsletter

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:36,450
get that email from the donor into the

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:39,600
email system one way or other and then

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:43,000
the best way would have a welcome series

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:48,820
but that requires content and that might

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,030
be a little tricky so what's the next

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,030
one

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:58,830
okay so I'll keep your donation form

00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:02,650
simple this is all an example from I

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:05,140
cannot yet convince them to go to a

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,670
simple model but don't ask those million

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,120
questions I want to get through my

00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:12,670
information so this is much simpler on

00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,700
this screen you have a button on your

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,620
website donate $50 so it's already are

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,010
suggested there hit the button and then

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,550
this little popper or module comes up

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:28,870
with the stripe information email credit

00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:30,940
card but yeah that's the simplest form

00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,790
and that works move out too so that's is

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,140
where you want to get to yeah

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:40,420
of course talking

00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:42,880
through that process is only I find that

00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,530
say okay if you need to have the address

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,230
because you want to send them a welcome

00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:51,040
message or welcome kid or something like

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,900
that put this in the first email or in

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,929
the second email welcome them being a

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,210
donor second email goes out six days

00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:00,420
later or something like that and says we

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,760
want to send you our welcome gift or our

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:07,450
yeah we will need your mailing address

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,820
and then put it in there then and if you

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,740
yeah there are most of the touch points

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,980
that you have you can always ask for

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,980
more information

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:20,440
okay this is what you are here for what

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,090
are the plugins or other tools so the

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,500
forum and the stripe saying that minimal

00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:30,370
Viable Product that gets you very far

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:33,809
you can do this with any form plug-in

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:36,370
out there that has a stripe connection

00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:38,710
Madera forms gravity forms contact forms

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,690
ninja forms and then the plugins give WP

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,630
is definitely one of the most

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:47,169
sophisticated ones gets you from small

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:49,990
to big pretty you can use it pretty non

00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:51,760
it's not free it has a free version but

00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,740
I don't it only works with PayPal and

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,890
the version that you get people from

00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,250
your website to PayPal and back you lose

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,900
about 70 percent yeah so you need to

00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,880
cash out something yeah those things are

00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:07,929
not but the return on investment is

00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,540
really good and then there's a growing

00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:12,910
need for online interactions oh yeah so

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,630
people all of a sudden have Eventbrite

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:18,220
they use a membership site then if

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,600
buddypress they have eventual situation

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,530
and all of a sudden you have this

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,030
fragmented data sets you need your

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,250
donation records in each of ala t

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,960
records you need your strategic partners

00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,880
in your list yeah all of a sudden so how

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,929
many excellent spreadsheet can you

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,840
handle yeah or systems can you handle so

00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:41,169
that's when the organization close to

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:47,290
that level looking at a unified system

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:49,480
might help you to look at that so

00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,990
there are the data management challenges

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,300
that you already know duplication you're

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,690
not connecting so there is a site out

00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,540
there it's called CV CRM and civic CRM

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,330
is also like WordPress open source and

00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,200
it's software built by nonprofits for

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:11,140
nonprofits has been around since 2006

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,560
and has about 10,000 organizations using

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:16,900
it and organizations that our little

00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:27,790
larger actually contribute also to the

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:31,390
code base that software's problem yeah

00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:34,000
yeah yeah because what it does it looks

00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:37,410
a little you all have to squint back

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,850
there but it's build on top of WordPress

00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:45,580
so when you think about marketing the

00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:47,080
you go okay I have now the donation for

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,180
my subscription email newsletter

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,760
everything goes in different places here

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,650
it all goes in one database so when you

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,360
pull up a record by email address or by

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,160

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,930
identify that person you have all the

00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:04,780
activities in there you'll know which

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:26,830
in communication preferred communication

00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,530
so the people that are only preferred

00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:33,550
email only your phone or something like

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:35,710
that there's a lot of behind it so if

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,740
you want to learn more about it we are

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:41,800
putting together a resource page for

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:46,120
workers and civic CRM and it's at WP for

00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,880
good thought org slash CV CRM right now

00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,100
there's only a forum there to put your

00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,420
information in but we rolled this out I

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,460
just come back from a nonprofit

00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:57,700
technology conference where we did this

00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,260
so next resources they're all on the

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,679
slide I will share the slides later on

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:06,769
why our Twitter every icon that you see

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,380
has a link behind it where you can so

00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:12,710
these are the leadership sources and

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:15,559
then there are local meetups that are

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:19,399
like WordPress meetup organized

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:25,880
face-to-face in several areas

00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:28,340
Oh hmm

00:30:25,880 --> 00:31:09,260
make the world a better place thank you

00:30:28,340 --> 00:31:11,299
so much that was one here if you

00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,880
specialize when when you look put the

00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:16,940
donation button on the website does that

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:23,539
vary from different target audiences

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:27,470
that you try to reach a true hey the

00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:29,899
best part is people go to the website in

00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:33,470
heat maps so they did some studies

00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:35,899
oh when they're looking for something

00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,299
but of course that you have it on top of

00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:40,399
your page does not mean when somebody

00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:42,919
Scrolls down on your long long article

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:47,750
about the homeless issues that you can't

00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:49,970
put a form underneath learn that they

00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:53,029
put word out there who's heard about

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:55,789
good work all right that's not a whole

00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:58,460
lot read up about it

00:31:55,789 --> 00:32:01,010
but and it gives you a way to actually

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,870
put it in the middle of your content put

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,870
a little form or a little button there

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,309
you have to do all to action while

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,649
they're halfway through the article or

00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:12,260
something like that yeah so that's

00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:16,390
certainly yeah the more the merrier

00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,390
I say okay that was a question here

00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:29,900
since 1998 actually yeah I have a I came

00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:32,510
to the United States 20 years ago and

00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,400
that was I worked because I wasn't

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,720
allowed only money to earn any money for

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,320
the first four years I wasn't dragged

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,210
along by my husband I volunteered for

00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,000
the local Internet service provider that

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:47,240
was a non-profit the Freenet so to speak

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,240
yeah and they always had on the mission

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,660
to connect electronically electronically

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,130
connector community and so I was getting

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,440
lost in nonprofits because I find them

00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:01,640
really fascinating we have a similar

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,590
concept in Germany but it's not for yeah

00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,919
homeless or kindergarten or something

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,260
like that

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,179
yeah because those are all paid for by

00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,500
tax dollars so there's not an

00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:11,030
organization that forms around they're

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:21,650
there to do this essential things here

00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:25,760
and that's a question right yeah it is

00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:28,130
so we will publish it's at the South

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,650
Florida is a face-to-face meeting

00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:33,950
there's the resources on the text for

00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:36,140
good website so if you leave me your

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,960
email address or something like that

00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,840
under WP for good site then I can send

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,740
you some resource that we recap

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,490
afterwards yeah

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:48,820
- yeah you're welcome there was another

00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,820
question

00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:03,400
yeah yeah so question was what are the

00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:07,110
preferred email marketing systems so

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:10,330
because of the RSS to email it kind of

00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:13,870
takes a few email marketing providers

00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:17,470
out of the equation for me because I

00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:18,990
find that one of the major feature sets

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,300
that helps

00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:25,000
so it's MailChimp Aweber does that too

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,520
and there was another one a campaign

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,730
monitor also has others as to email but

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,790
any email marketing provider really does

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:37,890
this yeah it's just not as convenient

00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:40,480
and or automatic but

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:43,270
the the purpose is to stay in touch with

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,760
your supporters and whatever email

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,830
marketing system does that is better

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,940
than doing it from your Comcast email

00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:53,940
account no sir yeah

00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:15,119
yeah good point yeah

00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:17,369
MailChimp has 2,000 subscribers

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,270
Evelyn you can send them six messages

00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:25,130
and once all of them so that's a fairly

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:27,390
good sized free free account and it has

00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,970
automation with it so the email series

00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:34,250
you can actually use the six emails from

00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,250
that and it has yet another question

00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:50,480
okay what's it called maila like okay

00:35:52,990 --> 00:36:02,950
yeah okay yeah excellent nice research

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:13,190
so you use it okay

00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:16,550
Mela light mainly light one word yes and

00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:19,490
Deb Deborah is treating it out so if

00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:22,810
you're on Twitter yeah and I'll put it

00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:26,080
on the sides yes no question there

00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,080
George right

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,509
yeah that's kind of from anywhere to

00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:15,089
50,000 to 150,000 yeah

00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:15,089
it really depends on the requirement a

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,460
certain so if you use for instant

00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:23,499
represent CBC or em together you are

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,769
looking at you need you can't do this as

00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:28,180
if you can do WordPress view by yourself

00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:30,249
doing CBC or em by yourself you

00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,799
definitely need a backup consultant for

00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:36,339
that that can guide you through yeah so

00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:39,029
it's definitely something yeah back-end

00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:44,650
I yeah hosting is probably about

00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:47,529
thousand dollars a year now with cloud

00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:50,170
system that's really the the lesser part

00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:53,259
pretty much so I think we need to wrap

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,969
it up and it was a wonderful to meet you

00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:58,119

00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,869
have questions are gonna be around

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,979
because I'm saying of course all day

00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:04,979

00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,550
