Description: 
	When you think of business structure, you may think of a business or financial plan. Although both of these documents are great, they still don’t necessarily give you a clear visual to generate sales and attract potential customers to purchase your products and/or services.
In this session, I will discuss how to transform and market your business on the web creating a name for yourself online. This strategy has been proven to generate sales and you’ll be guaranteed a successful online presence.

	00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:11,390
okay good morning everybody

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:14,460
so usually when people think of

00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:19,140
restructuring and you know the structure

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,470
of a business they think of things like

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:35,579
a website well I'm here to tell you that

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:39,449
that is yeah okay okay well I'm here to

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,390
tell you that that is wrong sometimes

00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:44,460
people think of a business plan as a

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,820
business structure for your business

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,359
although people do business plans that

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,170
are so wrong as well as bearing a huge

00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,480
branding agency that is wrong as well so

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,370
today I am here to talk to you about how

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,480
you can restructure your business and

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,489
generate more sales

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,390
now before I said that these things were

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,430
wrong although that they you know are

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,650
factors that can help you generate more

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,840
sales they're not the first step that

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,580
you should take in fact they're probably

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,610
one of the last steps that you should

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,370
take and what I like to call the brand

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,590
development process so to tell you a

00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,870
little bit about myself I have been in

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,320
the web and graphic design field for a

00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,690
little bit over two years now service

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,430
over 50 individuals and small businesses

00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,860
across the Metro Detroit area all

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,530
ranging from different platforms I'm

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,580
some most from word-of-mouth for

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,490
different products and different

00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:48,660
services that I offer for people and

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:52,260
yeah so recently oh well before what I

00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,840
used to do was use my web and graphic

00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,500
design services to sell those you know

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,880
to use my new strategy to sell those

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,600
products and services to other people

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,840
but recently I realized that that method

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,019
has it has been working but you know

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,360
what's the point of a website if you

00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:15,780
know there aren't any people coming or

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,660
there's no traffic for your website so

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,520
I've you know come up with what I like

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,430
to call the brand development process

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,830
and it includes four steps and there are

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,840
many steps within steps in the brand

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,270
development process so there is a long

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,310
process that you know I usually take my

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,650
clients through or in the future that I

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,630
will take my clients through but it is

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,930
definitely worth it and it is definitely

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,190
worth the time and the money depending

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,000
on you know who you who you may be

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,730
working with so the first step is brand

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,830
awareness on some essential questions to

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,720
ask yourself

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,030
during this product is you know what is

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,650
your brand name how do you want to

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,600
convey convey your brand to your

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,170
customers how do you want your customers

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,640
to view you who is your dream customer

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,850
usually when you're finding your dream

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,760
customer you you know think of all the

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:12,000
things that you may want out of your say

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,470
for example if you were a customer and

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,690
you put yourself in your customers shoes

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,330
what would you want your customer to

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,920
experience and then after you know you

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,560
have found out who your dream customer

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,720
is this can help and assist and how you

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,670
will learn how you refine your target

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,890
audience for your business or your brand

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:36,590
the second step is strategic branding

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,940
and development and so this is you know

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,400
asking yourself a few couple of

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,980
questions like what market are your

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,560
customers in you know how the group what

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,420
market are your customers in nothing on

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,239
demographics because graphics usually

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:59,459
aren't you know the same as we your

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,160
particular market and to kind of

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,180
demonstrate this could I have everyone

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,060
stand

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,200
I want females on this side of the room

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,370
and males on this side of the room

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,370
yes come on

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:56,430
perfect perfect okay so next I want if

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,820
you are male or female and you are under

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,460
the age of 45 I want you to come toward

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,650
the front everyone above the age 45 go

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,160
towards the back still remaining on your

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,160
side

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:28,289
okay so right now you all are in

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,020
demographic groups so you all will be

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,569
males that are under the age of 45 new

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,210
all will be males over the age of 45 and

00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:39,270
for the female side as well over forty

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,490
five and under forty five so all these

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,409
people in this demographic group and all

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,569
of your demographic groups have

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,219
different interests which is primarily

00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:49,009
the reason why that you shouldn't

00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,569
advertise to a particular demographic

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:54,000
because if you're trying to sell cat

00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,460
food and people need your demographic

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,229
don't have cats then you're not going to

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,060
be able to sell in that demographic is

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,229
that making sense to everyone so you

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,639
want to make sure that you're not

00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,770
selling to the demographic and that

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,590
you're selling to a particular market

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,590
instead okay anybody can have a seat now

00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:34,009
I'm sorry to expose some of you guys as

00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,009
ages just for the sake of this activity

00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:43,889
okay so just to ask yourself is how

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:47,069
where do you where do people in your

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:50,459
market congregate to whether it be

00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:52,799
online or offline especially in this you

00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:55,860
know a generation where technology is

00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:58,860
advancing at everything we have Facebook

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,019
groups and different you know like you

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,599
know online blogs and communities that

00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:07,559
people are a part of and so you want to

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,919
just be sure or you want to know where

00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:12,719
your audience is and so there's a lot of

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,329
research that goes into this I won't

00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:17,939
really go deep into that because this is

00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:20,999
about restructuring and so the next

00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:24,869
question to ask is what process should I

00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:27,389
take my clients through to sell them on

00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:31,079
my product or service and so this is

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:36,709
where things get good okay

00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:43,159
so I want you guys to close your eyes if

00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:43,159
you want oh no no I'll just turn around

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:51,300
no I am dr. Gregory my name is dr.

00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:54,479
Gregory and I primarily focus on

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,149
dentistry and cleaning and you know

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:06,149
working on people's teeth oh can I have

00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:09,899
a volunteer please anyone thank you so

00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:14,219
much for violence area can you just come

00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:17,849
sit in this chair right here so what I

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:20,729
did is I know a list of my services here

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:23,549
now different services may be different

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:28,129
pertaining to how your teeth are and so

00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:28,129
if we take a look at your teeth here

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:40,500
okay so you know for you you may just

00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:42,209
need a teeth whitening kit because when

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,649
I cleaned your teeth I was noticing that

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,410
there were some yellow spots in

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:49,529
different areas so I can offer you my

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:53,300
tooth whitening kit that I could upsell

00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:55,620
you on and you know would you be open to

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,250
buying purchasing this tooth my decayed

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:02,820
it gray you know you have a boyfriend no

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,709

shining and wide you're gonna go I'm

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,100
gonna like hey you know rosanne so you

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,690
know you've got to make sure that your

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,420
teeth are white and pearly you know

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,930
great and clean okay so I'm gonna give

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,660
you my teeth whitening kit and you know

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,660
you just keep your teeth clean so that

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:28,200
was an example of upselling someone on

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,329
my product so what you would do after

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,339
you have listed your products or

00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,320
services is that you will rank them

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,440
because you are going to next put them

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,860
in a value letter value later thank you

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,269
for your time you can go back to now you

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,670
put them in a value lighter and

00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,850
basically as people go up this is an

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,610
example of a value lighter so as people

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,980
are going up your value letter you're

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,420
increasing their you're increasing the

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,730
value that they have in your company as

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,230
well as going up the scale for the

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,329
products that you ultimately want them

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,730
to reach which is for the people who

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:05,190
have no teeth at all a full denture

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,800
installation why because you're getting

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,750
the most money from that from that

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,209
service so maybe you would bring them in

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,699
and attract them attract your clients or

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,890
customers in your market as bait with a

00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,899
free teeth cleaning kit so maybe that

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,820
includes like you know a tooth brush and

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,079
floss and toothpaste mouthwash stuff

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,260
like that just to keep your teeth clean

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:30,390
on a regular basis then you know you'd

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,839
upsell them on a biannual teeth cleaning

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,940
and I don't know the prices for this you

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,110
know because I'm not a dentist so bear

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,339
with me on this I don't know if this is

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,610
accurate or not so again you would you

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,339
go up the value ladder

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,709
to a annual biannual cease cleaning and

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:49,149
then if you notice that you know their

00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:51,130
teeth are kind of yellow after you've

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,570
cleaned their teeth where you notice

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,160
that they were yellow before cleaning

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,750
their teeth because hopefully if you're

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,240
a good dentist their teeth are not

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,370
yellow after you finish cleaning them so

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,560
you would you could offer them a free

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,230
teeth of upsell don't want a teeth

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,540
whitening kit that may you know help

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,040
them keep their teeth white and then you

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,079
know if you're cleaning their teeth and

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,959
notice that they had you know some

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,149
little spaces here and there you could

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,430
give them a partial denture installation

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,269
which is basically like caps and bridges

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:24,130
and stuff like that

00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:27,700
oh Jesus then you know if you saw that

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:30,100
it varies based on the customer so you

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,660
can jump from different places on the

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,329
value lighter if necessary

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,130
although it is not recommended as it is

00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:37,269
necessary for that client like if they

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,640
open up their mouth and they have no

00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,920
teeth obviously then we need a for dense

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,329
your installation because you know how

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,040
you're gonna clean your teeth if they

00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:48,579
don't have any to you

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,660
so in some cases it is necessary to jump

00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,040
to different places on that value

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,949
lighter although it is not recommended

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,760
but sometimes it may help depending on

00:11:53,949 --> 00:12:03,220
your different clients so after you have

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:08,019
a value lighter you are going to make it

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:12,370
into a what I call a sales funnel sales

00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:15,970
funnel basically is your where everybody

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,320
okay so the basis of a funnel is to you

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,820
know how it's being at the top and then

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,250
it kind of goes down at the bottom to

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,920
this point right here so in a sales

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,029
funnel the top is where all of your

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,140
customers come in you know when you see

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:33,250
advertisement whether it be online or a

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,019
billboard or whatever it may be this is

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,449
where your clients start this is what

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:40,300
you show to them this is what you

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:42,430
attracted them as bait a free teeth

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,440
cleaning kit to help them clean their

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,089
teeth okay so that is where you're

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,680
presenting them with value at the first

00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,100
part and you know they don't have to pay

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,370
anything

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:55,840
so you're attracting them as bait and

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,250
then you upsell them whoa hey you know

00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,900
if you would like to come and get your

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,200
teeth clean you know just to check up

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,670
every six months we can do that for you

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,310
and you know upsell them to that nine

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,540
and nine dollars and then you know when

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,280
you come and clean those teeth just

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,260
basically taking them down the sales

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,840
funnel like how you did up the value

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,260
letter the only reason that I like to

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,470
use the analogy of a sales funnel it's

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,300
because everybody starts at the top but

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,100
not everybody is going to reach this

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,200
point at the bottom and that's okay

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,450
because not all of your clients or

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,340
potential customers will have the

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,410
financial means necessary to reach this

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,620
bottom part but this is where you want

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,780
certain people to meet and so you know

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,660
you have to make sure that there are

00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,210
different processes different skills and

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,780
strategies that you can use to help

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,610
people go down of this sales funnel for

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,970
an example I know that how many of you

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,150
are familiar with the TV show Seinfield

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,820
okay

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,550
perfect so you know how Seinfield comes

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,590
on every day and they have different

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,950
stories you know just about pretending

00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,960
to you know different things right so

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:07,960
what you can do is in an email

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,190
newsletter is tell your clients or

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,020
customers different stories and I

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,900
noticed that because you know I sign up

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,760
for a lot of Brenda brand development

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,230
consulting and people who do like online

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,120
marketing or stuff like that and they're

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,520
always sending me emails hey come join

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,670
my free webinar hey come do this hey

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,440
come do that but before they you know

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,810
tell me about their product or what they

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,430
want me to do they tell me a story and

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:36,070
they tell me a story based off of just

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,620
to attract me to come back to my sales

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,350
funnel to go through this process again

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,630
so for example if you know you're a

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,360
dentist you can be like hey you know

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,700
once upon a time I had no teeth - so you

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,020
know if you don't have no teeth you can

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,240
come to me and I can get you this

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,580
denture installation and you know you'd

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,280
be rockin with all the ladies again so

00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,740
you know you just have to you know tell

00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,260
people different stories attract them in

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,290
different ways and then there's another

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,660
one another strategy you can use is

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,240
called the soap opera sequence

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,310
and you know like you know my grandma

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,100
calls them her stories and they come

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,610
home everyday you know and they have

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,020
different you know there's a process

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,510
that you know they go through as well

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,630
and so you can use the soap opera

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:29,650
sequence too because it's kind of like

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,970
you know it's basically kind of the same

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,680
thing that's a sign filled sequence is

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,910
it comes on every day so you're like

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,230
kind of trying to sell them on your

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,120
product telling different stories and

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,510
everything but there is always a climax

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,550
and you know do okay when they leave you

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,470
on a cliffhanger and then you have to

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,570
watch the next day so it gives you

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,250
something it gives your clients and

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,420
customers something to look for the next

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,640
day they keep them coming back to your

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,750
emails so that they can ultimately get

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,530
them back through the sales funnel

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,110
process so say for example you know if

00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,190
you send them an email the first day

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,760
talking about how you lost your teeth

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,530
then you can give them you know leave

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,870
them on a cliffhanger and kind of

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,550
discuss how tomorrow you're going to

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,220
talk about you know how I helped my

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,590
friend get his teeth back to because you

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,700
know we was just you know we were both

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,340
sitting there with our no teeth

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,630
so you know just different different

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,490
sequences of different strategies to

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,800
help people go out but you know you can

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,510
use you can use different it doesn't

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,280
have to be you know dentist because I

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,260
know a lot of you here work with

00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,480
WordPress or if you don't then you know

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,970
you do like oh so sing or UI or UX

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,680
design stuff like that you can do it

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,410
based off of your market and what you

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,970
sell so it doesn't have to be for a

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,590
dentist of course I'm just using this

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:49,710
because it's a great analogy okay so

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:52,840
after you have completed and may it know

00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:55,840
then you will go on to your art and

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,750
design strategy this is where your

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,060
website comes into play and your logo

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,220
and your you know everything like

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,590
business cards this is how where you

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,750
make everything pretty and it's

00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:13,570
basically focused on the aesthetics of

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:16,330
everything and so when you are when you

00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,800
are you know using when you are trying

00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,110
to make everything pretty and you know

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,419
using instead

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,309
some questions you should ask is what

00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:28,350
direction could I use to attract my

00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:30,409
customers so I know that there are some

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:34,350
companies there are different types of

00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:36,929
design styles some companies go for more

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,840
elegant and modern feel with a nice

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,909
sans-serif fonts and you know very

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,889
minimalistic then there are other

00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:46,529
companies that like big bold flashy

00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:48,419
colorful branding and that that's what's

00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:50,340
used to attract their customers so you

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,440
want to know what art direction should

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,570
you use to attract your customers but to

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,039
know what our design you use you should

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,419
know what trends attract people

00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,460
aesthetically because I know that there

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,129
are a lot of different web design trends

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,980
and branding trends that attracts people

00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:06,690
but it's also based on your market so

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,480
you have to know what attracts people in

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:12,359
your market so say if I was trying to if

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,609
I my market was Millennials I have to

00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,889
research and find out what type of

00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:20,850
design and what attracts Millennials

00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:22,950
before I can use art to use different

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,769
art directions or what our direction I

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,169
should use to attract the clients that

00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,749
are in my market which is Millennials

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:33,480
but this can be for you know any people

00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:36,869
any any market it doesn't really matter

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,359
just it's important to know competitors

00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:41,580
are what they're using what art

00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,590
direction they're they tend to go

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,720
through and you don't have to just look

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,970
at one competitor you can look at you

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,869
know many other competitors it doesn't

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,869
really matter yes

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:05,450
music

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:19,340
so so do you mean like where it were

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:21,290
would you right right okay so basically

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:27,110
what she was asking is where would you

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:28,460
go for okay so remember at the beginning

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,100
when I said that you shouldn't hire a

00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,880
branding agency first this is the time

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:38,120
what you're a branding agency if you

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,490
don't have the skills to use you know

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,690
brand for your business by yourself does

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,500
that make sense that make sense

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:48,380
everybody else too so you know um if you

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,390
don't have this necessary you can hire a

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,640
branding agency now different branding

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,700
agencies may do things differently

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,590
depending on especially how they price

00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:01,460
especially how much value their company

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,810
has and so you have to you know make

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,270
sure that it's in your budget but

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,670
actually I'll also make sure that what

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:10,790
they're saying makes sense so like say

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:14,300
for example you had this dentist company

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:16,280
right if you see that you know if

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,780
they're if you you give them a

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,790
competitor analysis to tell them your

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,190
competitors right and they take a deep

00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,990
deep look at all your competitors and

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,180
they see that all of your competitors

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,800
have you know a logo pretending to

00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,170
something that has you know teeth or

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,150
something like that then if your

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,760
branding agency comes back and says oh

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,040
we're just gonna do a full text logo

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,450
that just has your name on it what good

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,000
is that doing me if all my competitors

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,250
are thriving in this market with a logo

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,260
that has a tooth on it because if you

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,440
just have a text logo of course you know

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:52,130
that you know it gives people an idea of

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,620
what you do but also at the same time we

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,210
want to have a logo that tells your

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,120
custom that tells your customers and

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,650
clients who you are what you do give

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,510
them a little bit of personality what

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,610
your brand is like who are the people

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,800
like that you're going to work with all

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,560
these people I mean don't you you'll be

00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,269
able to see you know you can you're able

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,519
to

00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,200
how you know your brand works and how

00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,489
the people are when they look at your

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,719
logo that answer your question okay no

00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:23,859
problem

00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:26,739
and so you know you also want to think

00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:29,349
how can you prevent yourself from

00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:31,599
misleading customers in your market so

00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:36,519
like the example I just used if you

00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:38,320
don't use a logo that is going to convey

00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:41,019
your brand and how you want to portray

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,119
your brand other people then you know

00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,459
it's not gonna be you know you're not

00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,429
gonna be able to be successful so you

00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:51,729
have to make sure it this is a very very

00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:53,950
very very tedious process and you know

00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:56,139
it takes a lot of steps and there are a

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,139
lot of things that you know play into

00:21:56,139 --> 00:22:01,989
the whole process but it is very worth

00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:05,049
it and you will you know be able to

00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:06,729
receive sales and generate more sales at

00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:08,049
the end of thing anybody have any

00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:11,349
questions about you know Art and Design

00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:18,129
related you know that's where it's where

00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:22,619
I specialize in ok ok

00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:22,619
and then those five step oh yes

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,970
what's wrong with that what's wrong with

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,880
that process I'm not my car but my craft

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:47,000
ori but if there's elements out there

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,700
was that important my site but i don't

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,520
feel a lot of the figure get the most

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,520
out so what should i do commitment

00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:10,200
properly okay so if you are on budget

00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:12,960
cuts you know you can't hire somebody to

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,890
do you know WordPress thank you

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,690
wordpress related your website for you

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,400
i'd recommend don't tell nobody because

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:24,930
this is work camp and talking about

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,490
wordpress but if you're on a budget and

00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,650
you can't hire anybody and you don't

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,780
have the skills to make a wordpress

00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:34,500
website and you don't have time to learn

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,180
don't use wordpress because you know

00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,820
you're not gonna you're not gonna be

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,970
benefited but i do recommend that in

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,940
this process that you know if you do

00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:47,100
have if you do have the money then to do

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,660
that because there there are many things

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:54,740
that there there's a lot that goes into

00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:57,150
a website for a brand especially

00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,950
considering you know what your brand is

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,770
and you know how you want to convey and

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,380
so you know if you have a basic

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,780
understanding or in-depth understanding

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,940
of this process then I guess you can

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,860
build your own website although it is

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:22,370
not recommended that make sense

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:22,370
everybody cool out comes oh right yeah

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:30,909
you have another question I just said

00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:34,209
that sometimes when you're like you're

00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:37,209
doing your own stuff you're so close to

00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:40,599
it that you can't make good decisions

00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:43,749
you don't have that you don't have that

00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:45,549
objective for you where as a designer or

00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:48,279
somebody else that's outside of your

00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:51,779
genre has a better view and a better

00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,779
concept of what it should

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,910
okay so the final step is the marketing

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,880
and advertisement step now this is where

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,190
we take everything that we did in the

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,010
previous steps and we tie it all

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:11,330
together and we mark it and we advertise

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:13,550
your business or your brand and so when

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:17,290
you are you know when you're when you're

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:19,010
marketing advertising it is important to

00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,920
implement the strategies that you

00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,690
brainstorm before so that you'll be able

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,540
to sell successfully to the people in

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:29,510
your market and there's something that

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:34,010
is called a free frame so a free frame

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:35,450
let me give you an example so say you're

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,530
at a webinar you're at a conference

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:41,570
about you know let's just say building a

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,820
website with WordPress and you're about

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,800
to go into this session and you know

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,580
learn from a speaker that you've never

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:53,330
heard of so somebody could say oh whoa

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:57,080
this speaker is very full in this area

00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:00,080
he knows he's doing he he's very kind

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,210
and very nice and he's intelligent and

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,340
everything but then another person can

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,560
go and they can say oh this person is

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,740
terrible he's oh my gosh like I can't

00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,780
stand him he's just so mean he doesn't

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,340
know anything he's talking about it's

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,950
just like don't don't even go to any

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:19,120
session so that's that's an example of a

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:23,150
pre-frame so you have like you know

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,150
you're you have to figure out how people

00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:28,040
are coming to you and what is making

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,440
them come to you because if you're on a

00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:33,920
website and you're you're advertising

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,800
social services somebody's ad could say

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:40,190
well you know these teeth if you go if

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,440
you go to this dental you know and you

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,880
go to this dentist's office you know

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,290
your teeth to be pearly white and clean

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,390
and everything and then you know they

00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,430
have those images of those perfect teeth

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,930
and you know couples just sitting next

00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,810
to each other frolicking along and

00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:56,900
everything but then there are some ads

00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:58,940
that have you know like bad teeth and

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,710
like really messed up and brown and

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,510
black looking teeth and they said oh

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,640
well this is what happened after I

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,390
visited this dentist's office so you

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,950
have to make

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,809
that your preframe and how people view

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,510
you before they come to your website and

00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:14,360
go through your sales funnel you have to

00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:16,280
make sure that it is positive free frame

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,780
and not a negative pre frame because if

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,630
you have a negative free frame and

00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,429
they're going to come to your website

00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:24,170
think well you know I don't want to come

00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,450
to him I just you know was trying to see

00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:29,240
what his customers were thinking and you

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:33,140
know how you know his how everything was

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:36,890
and how he was and stuff like that and

00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:39,140
you also want to know follow up

00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:42,470
strategies can I use to help people come

00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,540
back to this sales funnel so you cut

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,030
that before the Seinfeld sequence and

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,980
the soap opera sequence you know those

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,780
different strategies or things that you

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,610
can use to get people to come back to

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:59,120
your sales funnel thank you and you know

00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:03,140
so and you also know how you can Janee R

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,140
other companies sales funnels and things

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,150
like that to see where their traffic is

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,549
coming from how they get this traffic

00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:12,650
and you know what market they're doing

00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:14,750
so this is you know your competitors so

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,210
where your competitors traffic is coming

00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:21,080
from and how you can implement the

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:23,570
strategies that they use to use to use

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,880
it in your brand so that you'll be able

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,880
to be successful and generate more sales

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,690
does anyone have any questions yes

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,049
okay so the process varies based off of

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,870
what the client has so some clients may

00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:50,630
already have a website and then you know

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:53,990
but they don't have this process and you

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,059
know others may others may not have you

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:59,630
know a website but then have this step

00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:02,870
you know the sales funnel so it varies

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:04,640
based on your client so you know you

00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,799
just have to work around what your

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,390
client has and doesn't have if they

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,460
don't have anything I mean it varies

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,740
based on your client you know if you you

00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,190
really don't you can't tell until you

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:23,830
actually get into the process how long

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,830
it would take okay

00:29:30,300 --> 00:30:00,640
um so basically right well usually I do

00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:05,350
have a you know would take this process

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,450
um I I would make a document based on

00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,420
not really not really a spreadsheet but

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,220
just a document of what I did the

00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,110
process what we went through what we

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,400
came up with after you know different

00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,990
directions that different directions

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,300
that we took after looking at other

00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,830
competitors or you know just you know

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,350
things that you know came out of the

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,300
blue or maybe you know what they said

00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,400
based on their brief so just everything

00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,870
that we that we've done I put it in the

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,580
document the sales funnel and they're

00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,050
all their products and services that

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,620
were on the value lighter and in the

00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:38,260
sales funnel just you know it it it

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,950
would depend solely based on what the

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:44,650
client needs so to track their sales

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:47,679
though and their clicks and everything

00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,510
their sales I would use something like

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,580
Salesforce or something like that but

00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,980
for their analytics and to see you know

00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,679
their bounce rate because you know with

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,820
okay for their aesthetically pleasing so

00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,010
that people don't bounce from your

00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,450
website going somewhere else so to

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,760
measure their bounce rate how many views

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:06,790
they're getting and everything I would

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:11,170
use Google Analytics and another tool

00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:14,980
called similar web and basically what

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:18,880
you would do is you can track your you

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,230
know your referrals and where everything

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,920
is coming from and where they're going

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,990
to afterwards and how many views you're

00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,309
getting per month but the thing about

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,390
some of the web is that you can also

00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:33,010
track other people's you could check

00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,809
other people's sales and everything that

00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,030
you know that they've gotten as well and

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:39,640
so you know where they're uh you know

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,080
where their clients come from and where

00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,160
they go to afterwards how many sales

00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,049
they can you can you can track

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,749
everything

00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:47,879
what devices where in the world are they

00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:49,409

00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:50,820
