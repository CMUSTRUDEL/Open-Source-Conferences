thank you for that wonderful

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,230
introduction and good morning everybody

00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,179
I mentioned this at the very beginning

00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,730
but if anybody is not interested in

00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:18,610
Gutenberg development this is not where

00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,200
you want to be I would recommend going

00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,110
next door because briga it's going to do

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,390
a very awesome job talking about

00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,529
WordPress for nonprofits which has lots

00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,380
of good things in there that aren't just

00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,790
for nonprofit people but we're gonna

00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,090
talk about an intro to Gutenberg

00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:38,050
development how many people have not yet

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:44,050
looked at Gutenberg nice about half of

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:46,500
you sweet well my clicker works that

00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,500
would be amazing

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,850
hmm pause for technical difficulties

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,590
yeah how about that there we go all

00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,620
right so this is what Gutenberg looks

00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,670
like it's from a distance if you close

00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,890
one eye and screw it with the other

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,110
almost exactly like what the WordPress

00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,729
editor looks like right now you can see

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,190
a title up at the beginning you can see

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:14,159
some content below that a bunch of boxes

00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,530
off on the right hand side for

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,150
controlling the publishing schedule but

00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,400
if you actually look closely it's very

00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,310
very different because everything that

00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,180
goes into the content editor now is a

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,430
block the block is the the the smallest

00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,799
unit of measure for working with a piece

00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,049
of content in WordPress using the

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,360
Gutenberg editor and everything is a

00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,750
block paragraph is a block and image is

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,820
a block an embedded tweet is a block and

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,170
you can manipulate the blocks change

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,520
them from one thing to another and

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:51,670
compose some very nice layouts very

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,490
quickly without having to mess with HTML

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,869
or short codes or meta boxes and just

00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,070
wondering how it's going to look on the

00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:01,600
other end it's pretty cool so I'm gonna

00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,159
skip talking about Who I am because we

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,020
already did that

00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,759
but in case you were wondering I run WP

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,930
sessions where I help people be

00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,860
empowered by WordPress I'm gonna mention

00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,539
this right now I have a bunch of

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,889
stickers up here that I always forget to

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,810
talk about if I just leave into the end

00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:16,889
if you want a sticker I have a ton come

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,889
and take one or two or three

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,970
but today we're gonna talk about a bunch

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,010
of different things to build your first

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,530
block so Callen is going to present how

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,480
to actually make your block and I get

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,280
the easy job of just telling you a bunch

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,500
of vocabulary and things that are going

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,489
to be useful to you as you go about

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,049
creating your own blocks which means

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,519
that he gets to answer all of the hard

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,200
questions and I just get to say whatever

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,430
I want and move along so we're gonna

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
talk about some of the JavaScript

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,030
libraries that get included with

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,489
Gutenberg we're talking about how to

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,989
interact with and access those libraries

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,340
so you can actually use them in what

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,650
you're building we're going to talk

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,209
about the the core function that you

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,099
actually care about which is register

00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,409
block type this is the magic function

00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,569
that actually allows you to make a brand

00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:04,239
new block of your very own in Gutenberg

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,970
for whatever purpose so if for example

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,220
you were building a contact form plug-in

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,409
you might have a block that represents a

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,959
contact form somewhere in your piece of

00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:15,579
content we'll talk about some of the

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,970
types of blocks and some of the

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,530
different the anatomy of a block more or

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,329
less and then some other features that

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,400
you're probably going to care about and

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:26,859
want to use as you're building your

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,060
blocks before I go any further can you

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,819
hear me all the way in the back is this

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,329
good should I be a little louder little

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,599
louder

00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,370
how's this better so let's talk about

00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,970
some of the JavaScript libraries that

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,519
get included with WordPress rather with

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,720
Gutenberg for you to use in WordPress

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,250
for building your blocks

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:52,269
the first one is WP dot element and this

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:57,250
is a very thin wrapper for react

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:59,470
basically Gutenberg it's deep underbelly

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,409
is powered by react if you didn't know

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,989
that and the core team went about

00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:07,299
creating a few abstractions to that so

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,549
that if for any reason they need to

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,819
switch away from using react I don't

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:15,760
know for instance Facebook introduces a

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:19,269
new licensing policy that's hostile to

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:23,169
open source which wouldn't happen again

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,450
probably they could completely gut react

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,700
from the experience bring in something

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,750
else whether it's view or even vanilla

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,460
JavaScript

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,320
and everybody's blacks will continue to

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,750
work just fine because they were built

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,940
on top of WP element rather than

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,870
whatever the underlying react methods

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:44,080
were WP blocks includes tons of

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,500
components for building your blocks for

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,630
things like alignment controls and

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,810
inspector controls which we'll see a

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,120
little bit more about later WP

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,820
components are other generic components

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,310
that you can use for like creating rich

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,710
text fields and buttons and things like

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,750
that so you can very quickly build an

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,300
interface that looks like everything

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,480
else without having to code up every

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:15,150
single aspect of that interface by hand

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,750
WP i18n this is huge

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,580
internationalization and localization

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,530
has been something you've been able to

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,800
do with JavaScript and WordPress for a

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,240
long time but not in JavaScript so if

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,730
you wanted to have an internationalized

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,740
text string that showed up for like show

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,080
more show less on this button that was

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,740
driven by JavaScript you had to pass

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,650
that through via PHP using WP localized

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,560
script now you can just write your text

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,080
strings in your JavaScript and they will

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,880
be localized just like everywhere else

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,310
throughout WordPress which is really

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,900
good for internationalizing all of your

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,930
plugins

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,220
there's WP data which provides a bunch

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:59,560
of Redux state management and then tons

00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,080
of other packages basically any react

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,990
package that exists or any other package

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,660
that exists via NPM you can pull in and

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:13,470
use for your blocks which is pretty cool

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,940
so let's take a quick look at what the

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:19,270
what's in store for us on github so if

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,460
you go to github.com slash wordpress

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,900
slash gutenberg i'm also made a pause

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,670
here to mention that all of the

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,340
resources that I mentioned here are all

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:31,980
linked in these slides and my slides are

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,810
all available at WP sessions calm /wc

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,920
det and that'll be on the screen at the

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,480
end so you'll be able to get all of this

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,880
so if you miss something don't worry

00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,220
it'll be there for you anyway at github

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,220
comm slash wordpress slash Gutenberg

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,230
we've got the actual plug-in repository

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,220
where it's being actively developed

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:53,110
right now and you can dig into each of

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,940
these so if we were to click on for

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,920
example the blocks directory to see all

00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,770
of the blocks that Gutenberg ships with

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,170
we would not see any of the blocks that

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,780
Gutenberg ships with because these are

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:07,170
the the components that you'd be using

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,660
to make your blocks as I mentioned

00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,490
autocomplete editing controls color

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,080
palette things like that that you'll

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,000
probably use in your block but these are

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,000
not the blocks themselves what you're

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,790
actually looking for is the core -

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,950
blocks directory this has the audio

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,170
block the button block the gallery block

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,300
all of the different blocks that exist

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,730
in the core guttenberg editor as you're

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,470
dropping in to make your content are all

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,600
defined here in the core blocks

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,020
directory so if we were to look at the

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:42,160
code block for instance here we see the

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:44,890
index J is the JavaScript that defines

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,390
and powers how this block works we see

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,060
it style sheet and we have a directory

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,610
for tests for testing it there's really

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,490
good test coverage across all of Google

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,680
burg which I like a lot and then if we

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,410
were to go in deeper and look at the

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,470
code that runs this block and click on

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,340
index J yes we would see nothing yet

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,440
because I'm getting ahead of ourselves

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,290
so we'll come back and talk about some

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,570
of the code in a little bit the

00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,400
important thing is there are tons of

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,590
JavaScript libraries that are now part

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,720
of Gutenberg that will eventually be

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,600
part of core that make the development

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,390
experience so much simpler has anybody

00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,500
ever made a widget for instance in

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:28,900
WordPress or added your own meta box for

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,000
controlling metadata where you have or

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,430
your own settings page right you have to

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,010
roll all of your own UI and build all of

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,870
your own stuff and thankfully the core

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,479
team thought through that and provided

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,490
so many Handy tools for us so how do we

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,220
get access to those how do we work with

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,480
those well all of the JavaScript

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,110
libraries that I just mentioned are

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,880
attached to a global object in

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:55,860
JavaScript called WP so you get WP

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,630
element WP block WP by 18 n

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,680
or if you want to go back even further

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,880
it's window dot wpe dot whatever script

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,330
that you're trying to access in

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,280
JavaScript and you can check all this

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,080
out in your browser right now if you've

00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,560
got Gutenberg installed so if you open

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,930
up an editor page with Gutenberg loaded

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,160
and you open up your web inspector tool

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,650
and you type WP element or WP blocks and

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,760
hit enter you'll see all of the stuff

00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:28,200
that's in there or if you need to do

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,530
that dot WP and so here I have a nice

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,650
little yeah let's make it for real I'm

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,960
gonna type WP element and look at all of

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:41,000
the stuff that's stuffed in WP element

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,000
and then if we check out wPBF

00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,560
to access them so if you want to use

00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,880
them in your code not just fiddling

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,920
around in the browser you make your

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,420
plugin you register it in queue all of

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,390
the assets that you need for doing your

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,870
own stuff and then in your JavaScript

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:12,330
you'll reference WP element and then

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,280
maybe WP element dot create element

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,800
which is a function that will generate

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,560
HTML for you so you could say I want an

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,180
h1 tag so you say I need an h1

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,830
it's going to have these attributes and

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,200
this is going to be the content of that

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,790
h1 like hello world or I need a

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,790
paragraph tag or I need six paragraph

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,320
tags there's this handy dandy create

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,690
element function that exists for you

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,320
you're probably not going to use it too

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,670
much if you're writing in es6 and beyond

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,410
and using JSX

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,970
syntax which Callen is going to show off

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,610
because you can just start writing HTML

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,910
in your JavaScript and it goes really

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:51,750
fast everybody else there's this handy

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,950
create element function and so on but

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,010
you don't want to rename these libraries

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,540
because typing WP elements that create

00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,820
element every time you want to use that

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,200
function it's just too much work I'm

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,810
lazy I don't want to type that many

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,510
characters forget about it and so

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,850
JavaScript makes it really easy to alias

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,669
what you're working with so in

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,639
es 5 and older syntax you might say var

00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:17,970
create element equals WP data elements

00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,519
dot create element or in es6 and beyond

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:23,519
you might extract that method so you'll

00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,279
say Const create element and I'm going

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,959
to pull that from the WP elements object

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,179
and in both cases what you end up with

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,789
is a variable named create element that

00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:35,100
you can just use as a function so at the

00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:37,079
bottom I can write create element feed

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,850
it the first parameter which is the the

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,649
tag that I'm creating the second

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,059
parameter is an object of all of the

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,639
different attributes that I'm going to

00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,869
use on that tag and then the final

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,389
parameter is what do I want to put

00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:52,699
inside that tag so this example would

00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:54,899
create an h1 tag that says hello world

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:55,859
and so you can do this for all of the

00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,319
different libraries right you want to

00:11:55,859 --> 00:12:00,809
use something from the blocks library

00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:02,819
you can say var whatever equals WP

00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:04,889
blocks dot whatever the thing is and now

00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:05,989
you just type your nice short variable

00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,309
the whole way through

00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:09,809
anybody who's been doing anything with

00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,989
JavaScript for any amount of time knows

00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:14,729
this and I just wasted your time sorry

00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:17,639
for anybody who's new today you can

00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:19,619
shorten what you're typing and so

00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,909
register block type as I mentioned is

00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:24,149
the function that you're going to be

00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:26,069
caring about the most because this is

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:31,019
the one that actually lets you register

00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:33,149
your block for use in Gutenberg and I

00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,409
just said that it has a few basic

00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:36,329
settings right you have to give your

00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:38,159
block a name and this has to be a

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:41,369
namespace name so we don't have

00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,499
collisions right your contact form block

00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:45,389
is not going to collide with my contact

00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:47,309
form block because mine has the

00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,459
namespace of risen and yours has a

00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:53,789
namespace of whatever before that and so

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:57,209
that's like the ID if you're registering

00:12:53,789 --> 00:13:01,439
a widget you give it title you give it

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:02,909
an icon you give it a category and this

00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:04,829
is one of the ways that can look in

00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:08,220
JavaScript so you give it a name in this

00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:11,069
case this is the core slash code block

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,470
that I was referencing earlier it's got

00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:18,269
a title which is just code it's got an

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:20,489
icon which uses the dash icons library

00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:21,899
that's included in WordPress core so you

00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,680
get all of those for free so it's using

00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,750
the editor

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,330
Oh daikon and it's in the formatting

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,750
category and so then on the front end

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:33,779
where you're looking at what you're

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:36,750
making here inside of Gutenberg we have

00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,029
the formatting category and inside that

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,730
category we have our code block which

00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:45,540
has the icon and the title that we

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,040
specified you don't see the name anyway

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,620
that's just the internal ID for

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,750
referencing in all different places and

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,730
then it also has edit and save settings

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,310
so these are responsible for managing

00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:00,180
the editor experience and managing what

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:03,690
gets saved when the post is saved and by

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,120
default all of your block contents get

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,290
saved to the post content using a

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,750
mixture of HTML comments and actual HTML

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,670
which I remember as Gutenberg was first

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,020
coming into being a lot of people are

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,940
like oh no this gonna ruin all of our

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,589
structured data what about all these

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,120
things that were conveniently put into

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,920
meta boxes because this was structured

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,080
data that we need to have in one certain

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,690
format good news you can save your data

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,070
wherever you want by default as stuffs

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,260
it in the post content but you could say

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,970
I want to save this to post meta I want

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,230
to save this to a custom table forget

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,420
you WordPress I have my own way of doing

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,770
things I'm gonna save the data here but

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,150
by default it goes into the post content

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:45,810
nice and simple and so this is the edit

00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,100
and save method for that same code block

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,820
that we looked at before so the edit

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:54,570
method is returning a plain text editor

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:58,770
and it's got a placeholder it's got a

00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:01,770
label it's got values and stuff for what

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:04,589
this block actually holds and then on

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,260
save it's just saving out the compiled

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,420
HTML so in this case in your content

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,310
editor you'll have a pre tag followed by

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,959
a code tag followed by whatever content

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,089
you put into the block and then it

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,490
closes both of those tags and again on

00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:19,290
the front end in the editor this is the

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,990
experience you get if we flip back so we

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,310
created a plain text input that's one of

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,839
the components that you get for free

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,130
courtesy of all the libraries which

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,260
looks like this and you just start

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,079
typing in plain text and then when you

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,600
save it the HTML it generates is exactly

00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,930
what we wrote here but it will also do

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,970
some handy things like injecting

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,589
last names based on the block that

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,720
created that element so you can easily

00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,580
style things without having to manually

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,630
type in I want the class name to equal

00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,710
this because you'd have to do that for

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,600
every single block and it'd be

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:51,770
monotonous and WordPress just does it

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,540
easy there's a few other things for you

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,810
for free that are kind of handy that

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,850
kellan can talk about maybe but then the

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,680
the most important part of your block

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,370
are the attributes because the

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,720
attributes are your variables these are

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,190
if we were thinking about a meta box

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,500
this is your post meta that you're

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,600
working with this is where you're saving

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,510
the data and all of the different

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,430
configurable aspects of your block so in

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,020
a paragraph your attribute would be the

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:22,790
content right what's the content that

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,810
goes into this paragraph and so here we

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,670
have an attribute that's just some

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,190
editable content on the block quote

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,430
block we have one attribute that's the

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,500
quote a second attribute that is the

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,790
attribution for that quote attribute

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,149
attribute can I say attribute ten more

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,160
times nothing confusing there and so

00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:43,279
attributes have a bunch of properties

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,070
they have a type they have a default

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,380
value if you want they have a source

00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,270
where is this data coming from they have

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:54,140
a selector so not only what's the source

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:56,390
how do I select that source and then

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,370
sources may require other levels of

00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,020
specificity which we'll get into in just

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:04,550
a couple of slides here so attribute

00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:09,199
types string number object array or any

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:10,069
other react prop type the most part

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,110
you're probably gonna be working with

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:18,350
strings and arrays but you're explicitly

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:21,110
saying this is what kind of data that is

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,540
stored in this attribute and then

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:27,319
sources might be text so if your source

00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,880
is a plain text editor or rather your

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,760
block is a plain text editor your source

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,880
is the text that's inside of that HTML

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,550
element it might be the full HTML markup

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,620
maybe it's just one of the attributes of

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,700
that HTML markup weird applause because

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,410
this is very confusing right we're

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,540
talking about attributes of gute of

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:48,110
Gutenberg and one of the properties of

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,430
your attribute can be attribute or sorry

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,750
one of your sources can be

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,760
attribute which means that one of the

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,990
other properties can also be attribute

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,310
attribute attribute attribute we'll look

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,550
at example of this in just a second I

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:04,250
think let me jump ahead yeah I do okay

00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,960
um so it could be an HTML attribute is

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,330
the source for this data it could be

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,660
children so like all of the paragraph

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,590
tags that are a child of this div are

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,240
what I'm working with

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,450
right if you have a multi paragraph

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,430
editor you want all of the paragraphs so

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,050
you're saying give me this div but I

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,870
want all of the children that are inside

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,280
of that div to work with for my data or

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,410
you can write a query that's pulling

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,150
multiple things for you at once you have

00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:33,380
an attribute that has a couple of

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:37,520
properties and so it's just this nested

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,860
in another level deeper and then meta as

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,380
in post meta you can pull this data from

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,790
meta and the Gutenberg Handbook which is

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,680
linked at the bottom of the slide and

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,360
again at the end of the slide deck goes

00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,760
into great detail about all of these

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,410
sources and how to use each one and I

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,300
think Callen is going to show off a

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,700
little bit about the sources in his

00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,670
examples and so then we have additional

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,290
properties for defining how to get the

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,430
data out of your source so I already

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:08,120
mentioned selector that's the element or

00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:12,110
class name or ID so I want every div

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,540
that has a class of alert block that's

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:17,030
my selector and then inside of that I

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,140
want all of the children so my type is

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,510
going to be an array so I'm going to

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,760
have an array of child elements that

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,470
exist inside of this alert block that I

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,910
created which are ultimately going to be

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:31,730
paragraph tags and so if you specified

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:34,370
your source is attribute then you also

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,340
specify an attribute property that might

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,560
be href right maybe your block creates a

00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,840
link and so ultimately it's just writing

00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,110
a single anchor tag to the content area

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,060
where you have an href a title maybe

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,640
some other interesting information and

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,950
so when somebody comes back to edit the

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,710
URL for that link you need to pull that

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:58,070
URL out of the anchor tag so your source

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,530
is going to be an attribute and then the

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,980
attribute property is going to be H

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:07,310
rath tracking with me it's really muddy

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:10,040
until you actually start writing it and

00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,170
then if your source was meta then you

00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,850
also have to define a meta property that

00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,380
is the name of the key that you're

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,970
working with so my source is meta and

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,980
then the meta key that I want is alert

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,730
block content for instance if that's

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,380
what I was saving to post meta and so on

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,000
there there are a few other additional

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,400
properties depending on what you're

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,140
trying to use for selecting your stuff

00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,900
so I've got a few examples that I pulled

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:41,720
from core so we've got a message

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,690
attribute its source is text the type is

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,360
string and the selector is gutten dev

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,150
notice so you can imagine this is this

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,940
one's actually not from core sorry this

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,190
one has a div of guten dev notice and

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,280
the content of that is just the text and

00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,560
it's just gonna be a string this one is

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,600
from core and so we've got three

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,730
different attributes we have a URL we

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,040
have alt text and we have a caption the

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,560
URL is a string its source is an

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,540
attribute the selector is the image tag

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,550
and the attribute that we're pulling

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,980
this data from is the source attribute

00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:18,230
on the image similarly for the alt

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,090
attribute we're pulling the alt

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:24,740
attribute and for the caption attribute

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,690
we're pulling an array of children found

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,790
inside of the figcaption

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,070
element so if figcaption could have a

00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:33,320
bunch of paragraphs we want all of those

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,120
so we want every child element inside of

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,170
the figcaption give me that whole array

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,960
and that's what I'm working with

00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,730
for the caption data and so here are all

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,890
of the settings together we talked about

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,050
all of these except for keywords

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,670
supports and transforms so name

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,800
description icon category that's how

00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,290
you're seeing to select the block in the

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:55,970
editor keywords allows you to specify up

00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:57,230
to three additional text strings for for

00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,030
finding this because there's a type

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,850
ahead a look ahead SERP so you can just

00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,870
start typing to filter the blocks

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,090
thankfully the people who designed this

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,710
limited it's three so all of the plug-in

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,210
authors who are now adding tons of

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,980
blocks their plugins aren't just

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,360
stuffing tons of keywords into their

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,340
blocks that it always shows up no matter

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,120
what you type so you can have three

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,470
other things

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,510
that describe your block so that people

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,340
can find it very easily by typing it so

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,289
for web dev studios that just release

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,870
their own cool block library you can

00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,610
type WDS and see all of the blocks that

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,640
are available from their plugin for

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:32,000
instance even if WDS wasn't in the title

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,490
of the block supports is for defining

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,380
additional things that your block

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,150
supports right now it's mostly for

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,100
defining things that it doesn't support

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,850
like I don't want to support the raw

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,370
HTML editor for my block so inside of

00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,549
the supports property I say HTML faults

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,779
so you cannot edit this block via HTML

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,899
in the future you'll be explicitly

00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:56,539
saying yes I do support these things

00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:59,750
just like you can say my post type

00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:01,700
supports a title and editor you know all

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,760
of these other things now your block can

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,279
support these additional features and

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,899
then transforms is a really cool thing

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,010
that we're not really going to cover

00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:13,010
this morning but I want to mention

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,679
because it's possible to change from one

00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:18,529
block type to another block type and

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,299
core does this a lot if you have say

00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:22,279
three paragraph blocks and you want to

00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,380
make it a bulleted list you select those

00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,610
just like you would any normal text but

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,779
there's three separate blocks and you

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,090
say I want to make this a bulleted list

00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:31,250
and Gutenberg will change them from

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,320
three separate blocks to one block

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,500
that's now a bulleted list with each of

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,640
those paragraphs as a list item and

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,620
conversely you could go from it being a

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,330
bulleted list to paragraphs and it does

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,370
precisely the opposite it explodes the

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,309
list into multiple paragraph box blacks

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,659
and so in this you can define how those

00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:49,100
transforms work because it's all

00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,020
structured data you're just working with

00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,520
objects in JavaScript so you can say I

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,990
want take this object and make it into

00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,429
this other object so pass this data to

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,669
here pass this of the data's are there

00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:00,640
and it does buddhu magic and today you

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:04,490
have a different block on the other end

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,980
so types of blocks we have static blocks

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,480
which are not editable at all

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,470
you drop the block in it does whatever

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,520
it's doing you have no control over it

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,840
contact form would be a good example of

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,240
this right you're not really going to

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,549
edit the contact form you just want to

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,559
put it on the page except most contact

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,240
form blocks are going to be editable if

00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,260
you're thinking like gravity forms ninja

00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,440
forms whatever cuz you have to select

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,060
which form you want to show we get the

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,740
idea you

00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,830
dropping something in you can't change

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,840
it at all an adblock might be a good

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,640
example for content creators right

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,800
they've got ads that used to drop an ad

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,390
block in and move on they have no

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,560
control over what the ad is they just

00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,730
need to say I need an ad to show here

00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,650
editable on the other hand you can now

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,660
configure the content so you've got some

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,820
editable text like the paragraph block

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,070
that ships with core and then dynamic

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,060
where you're saving only your settings

00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:00,370
because the content itself is dynamic

00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,890
and changing so if you're pulling the

00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:05,680
latest posts from the REST API for

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,350
instance you don't want to save those

00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,480
five links in the content editor because

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,100
tomorrow they should be different so you

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,080
just want to say I want the five most

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:18,820
recent posts go and fetch them on page

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,500
load and so Gutenberg makes that very

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,810
easy you save the attribute data you

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,700
don't save any HTML and then when it

00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,710
renders on-the-fly maybe you have

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,150
server-side rendering that builds out

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,770
what you need just like you would

00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,110
traditionally with a widget or how you

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,810
handle meta boxes and tada here's the

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,900
final finished version in almost real

00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,550
time for what you need on this page and

00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,040
we have a few other features that I'm

00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,410
going to sprint through you can have the

00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:48,310
unselected versus the selected state of

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:50,080
a block which looks like this unselected

00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,180
it just looks like what it should look

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,100
like on the front end and then you click

00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,650
on it and now you see all of the editor

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,550
controls the goal of Guttenberg I

00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,230
probably should have mentioned this at

00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,560
the beginning for anybody who's unclear

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,490
is to give you an actual

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,850
what-you-see-is-what-you-get experience

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,890
rather than what you see is WTF which is

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,840
most of what happens when you're working

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,850
with a WYSIWYG editor Gutenberg gets

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,190
really close to giving you a true

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,900
experience but you have to hide the

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,370
editor controls while still making it

00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,330
possible for people to edit things so in

00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:24,700
the selected state they appear we've got

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,460
a formatting toolbar which looks like

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,050
this so you click in to start editing

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,340
the text and then the familiar

00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:33,130
formatting toolbar that you might

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,420
recognize from tiny MCE pops up and now

00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,820
you can control all of your text

00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,430
formatting and then there's also

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,350
inspector controls so if you click on a

00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,900
block and you look at the advanced

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,190
settings the right hand side of the

00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,169
screen rather than seeing the normal

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,900
publish information for your post now

00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:52,210
you can see additional controls just for

00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,830
this one block you can stuff all kinds

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,660
of great things in there where like

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,789
somebody might need to control something

00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,730
but there's no good visual way to

00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:02,679
present that in the layout you throw

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,970
them the inspector controls everything's

00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:09,640
fine so there's a lot of stuff that I

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,830
just blasted through and Kellen's going

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,780
to help get you even more lost right

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,250
after this but just in case you want

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,870
some guideposts I have a few additional

00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,610
resources for you

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,740
the official Gutenberg Handbook is

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,990
pretty good at describing a lot of the

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,500
basics that's at wordpress.org slash

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,140
Gutenberg slash handbook there's an even

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,600
more comprehensive learn Guttenberg

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,010
handbook that's coming and I know it's

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,380
coming because I helped write a couple

00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:37,120
of the chapters but it's not published

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,950
yet I think that one's gonna land at

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,610
learn that wordpress.org when it's

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,140
finally all done that goes into really

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,590
really deep details about all the

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,450
different things there's a fantastic

00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,610
companion article that my friends at

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,220
reactive Studios wrote that talked about

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,260
all of the different attributes settings

00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,909
because the official handbook is really

00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,080
wimpy when it talks about all the

00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,809
different cool things you can do with

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,640
your block attributes and then J at

00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,470
reactive goes into great detail about

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,000
like what if you have this real-world

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,200
scenario well this is the kind of

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,440
attribute you would use and how you

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,630
would select it and then if you want the

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,640
full experience if you liked my slide

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,980
deck you should thank my friend Zach

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,390
Gordon because I stole most of it from

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,630
him

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,159
and if I sound smart it's because I took

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,679
his Gutenberg Development course I

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,250
reached out to him he set up a coupon so

00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,690
if you go to Gutenberg dot courses and

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,669
pick his development course you can take

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,740
30% off so it makes it fifty five bucks

00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:38,740
which is just steal I think it's like

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,970
ten or twelve hours of content maybe

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,580
it's less than that maybe it's eight I

00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,200
know it's it's perfectly succinct and it

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,400
covers everything you can just jump

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,080
right in the middle like how do I make a

00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,789
block and he walks you through the whole

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,860
thing beginning to end

00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,409
tux through all the awesome stuff very

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,880
very good course if you want to just dip

00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:55,120
your toes in the water and get your feet

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,520
wet

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,770
he came to my site WP sessions and gave

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,600
an intro to Gutenberg development course

00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,640
which is somewhere between what I'm

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,370
presenting and what Callen is presenting

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,100
to give you just a little bit more of a

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:13,060
picture about what's going on and that's

00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,890
only ten bucks I don't I don't remember

00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,600
what my own stuff it costs but instead

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,400
of agree sessions calm if you want

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,850
everything for this weekend

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,990
thanks to me speaking here you can get

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,260
everything I offer

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:28,360
I have 92 hours of sessions of other

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,730
awesome smart people coming to present

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,580
you can get the whole thing for 149

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:37,410
bucks and all of that is linked with the

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:41,830
slides at WV sessions comm /wc

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:49,570
Det just like the event hashtag so thank

00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:52,420
you I almost forgot

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,550
I am organizing a virtual conference

00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,870
called word sesh which has happened a

00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,970
bunch of yous in the past that's

00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,200
happening in July if you like everything

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,370
that's going on here today

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,110
you're probably also going to like that

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,880
because you can do the same stuff that's

00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:08,230
going on here but from your home in your

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,630
pajamas so check that out that's it so

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:14,770
I'm going to take a couple of questions

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:16,210
while Kellan gets set up but I would

00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,890
suggest that you save most of your

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,810
questions for him because we'll have a

00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,000
nice big long question period at the end

00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,490
so does anybody have like some low-level

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:32,710
easy questions that I can answer right

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:36,310
now what if you use Divi I'm sorry I'm

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,350
going to need you to but no you'll

00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:40,480
probably be ok so there's been a lot of

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,820
speculation of what happens to all of

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,220
these layout editors in the world of

00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,320
Gutenberg most of them have already

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,460
started and if they're not are way

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,990
behind the eight-ball at this point

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:53,380
they've already started working on

00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:54,880
integration with Gutenberg so the way

00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,470
you're doing things now will probably

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,570
still be the way you'll do them in the

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,370
future but then as they get more

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,320
integrated with Gutenberg it'll be more

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,730
like working in Gutenberg and the stuff

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,760
that you're pulling from Divi or other

00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,560
page builders will likely just be blocks

00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,690
in Boonton

00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,210
so it'll be the you'll have the

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,100
Gutenberg experience essentially but all

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:17,120
of the stuff that you liked from

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:21,020
whatever your layout builder was cool

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,280
any other quick and easy questions

00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:29,030
what's the meaning of life why is the

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,030
