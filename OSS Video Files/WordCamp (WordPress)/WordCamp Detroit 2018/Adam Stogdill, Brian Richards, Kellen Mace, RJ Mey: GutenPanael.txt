Title: Adam Stogdill, Brian Richards, Kellen Mace, RJ Mey: GutenPanael
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	A couple months ago, the Metro Detroit WordPress Meetup held a session, led by RJ Mey, where he introduced us to Gutenberg and talked about the benefits and considerations that WordPress developers may need to consider with the upcoming release. The talk turned into a VERY lively Q&A session, so we decided to bring that conversation right into WordCamp Detroit.
This Gutenpanel, moderated by RJ Mey, will tackle some of the questions people have been asking about Gutenberg. We will have several developers who have experience with Gutenberg ready and able to answer your Gutenquestions!
This session is part 3 of our 3-part Gutenberg track. Check out session 1: Introduction to Gutenberg Development and session 2: How to Build Your First Gutenberg Block
