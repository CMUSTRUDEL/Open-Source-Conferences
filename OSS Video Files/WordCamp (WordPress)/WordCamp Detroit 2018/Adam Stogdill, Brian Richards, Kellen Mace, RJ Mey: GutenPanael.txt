Title: Adam Stogdill, Brian Richards, Kellen Mace, RJ Mey: GutenPanael
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	A couple months ago, the Metro Detroit WordPress Meetup held a session, led by RJ Mey, where he introduced us to Gutenberg and talked about the benefits and considerations that WordPress developers may need to consider with the upcoming release. The talk turned into a VERY lively Q&A session, so we decided to bring that conversation right into WordCamp Detroit.
This Gutenpanel, moderated by RJ Mey, will tackle some of the questions people have been asking about Gutenberg. We will have several developers who have experience with Gutenberg ready and able to answer your Gutenquestions!
This session is part 3 of our 3-part Gutenberg track. Check out session 1: Introduction to Gutenberg Development and session 2: How to Build Your First Gutenberg Block

	00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,310
start with like a real simple survey

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:26,230
first things first

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,230
how many people don't you Berg is

00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:50,210
actually how many people think that

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:52,609
Gutenberg is a great idea how many

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,129
people think Newberg is the worst thing

00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:57,019
in the history of the internet as if you

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,829
passed importance of spinach and big

00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:02,340
controversial torches and pitchforks but

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,910
put together

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,590
okay sore eyes any I think the mega by

00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:13,570
reading the room that we're all kind of

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:15,910
in the middle about that's up okay so

00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,050
let me turn that off Madhuri James I

00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,240
just wanna start off with a nice simple

00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:35,050
easy question for you guys what do you

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:39,009
think is the best part right I think the

00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:42,070
best part is a true busy way or what you

00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:45,729
can get editing experience and in

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,560
WordPress I know many of you know or

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:49,410
precisely probably used to be using

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,810
summation is my vacuum a pipe

00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,710
[Music]

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,140
field RCMP to enlist our number of like

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,110
planes it is giving you give us a block

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,520
and then you can find it you know

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:04,159
envisioning of what it will look like on

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,390
the front when it gets its render there

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,790
but the back kind of like seeing it

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,259
appeal to you filling out any sense of

00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,890
like what it actually looks like you

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:15,830
know it's a good purpose the big

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:19,310
advantage of my eyes is for developers

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:22,040
to create a truly new experience and

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,530
give people a live preview of what that

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,100
thing will look like on the front as

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:31,390
they're taking in it

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,520
and again it's live stated to reflect

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:38,770
those changes and they can say knowing

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:40,470
that your friend it will look like this

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,090
a nicer editing experience overall

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:48,430
helper Kristi black ones that are

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:55,030
straight level of issue lies on the head

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:56,680
experience I would say like two

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,670
different to Martha they're all the same

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:05,430
is the fluid and seamless experience

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,430
that a lot of care

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,160
[Music]

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,110
most of the admin experience February

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,299
press

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,239
do you think

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:23,640
perfectly for serving WordPress core but

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,319
us as developers trying to add to it we

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,209
have to bring in all over us up we want

00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,829
to say expansion perfect I'll tell you

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,870
that but you have to figure out how to

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,689
build Eli oh you want to create that

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,510
stuff like that but you have to do all

00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:37,260
the work and their own luck and it's

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,590
good right

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,620
everything is just say this and

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,650
apparently you know love to write like

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,000
all of it is standardized so as tons of

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,470
plug-in developers bring in their own

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,470
stuff the experience or person owns the

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,090
site it's going to

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,540
and all these blocks should come

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:02,210
together and be very familiar keys and

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,390
us developers don't have to read that we

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,190
like pepper bacon which makes for a very

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:10,010
new identity experience we just start

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,310
tightening and lots of care is also been

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,380
put into

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,829
short

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:22,049
[Music]

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:24,770
Bader's prophesy or jelly since I'm also

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:24,770
table

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,470
[Music]

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,950
it's not just yourself

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,950
[Music]

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,220
choose takes warfarin you

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,660
okay

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:27,879
so anything to do with yourself

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,879
[Music]

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:37,229
I only extra life before customers extra

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,229
life

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,380
I have been building

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,410
I don't want to be among the visual

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,990
request immunity but whoever should go

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,460
for

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,120
the fever builder is

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,550
yeah forget it beautiful ladies they

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,030
hold yet with Gutenberg's Nelson you

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,030
build one

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:14,770
you have a nice seamless smooth any

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,770
questions so far

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,770
yes

00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:31,120
[Music]

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,520
how will the website

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,420
we have

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:50,400
that question was a lot of sites are

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,400
built these builders some of us in here

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,770
start

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,939
at least from what I've seen there's one

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,310
I think that WordPress the core themes

00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,960
taking look out is that there's not only

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,289
to do very experienced there's also

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,779
plugin man

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:13,020
like that where you can keep those sites

00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:15,400
in the classic a little bit I think

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,830
we're saying that there's this

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,450
transition where a lot of these builders

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,450
are now going going to earth

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,160
they'd all be in morning business for

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,260
sending it's a stopgap for the specs

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,370
that are running that way and as time

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,370
goes on the facility

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:41,010
it's very awkward time as doctor bus

00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,470
somebody into earlier day we're like you

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,270
want to build for Rupert out of

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,390
Gutenberg is still the sort of moving

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,630
targets it's mostly well-formed it's not

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,490
completely done and it's a gamble to say

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:57,450
like I'm gonna we're going to build for

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,310
this now and then we don't say in a few

00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,640
more weeks because much of that has

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:05,520
changed ideally not impossible but

00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,380
that's also true if you don't mind right

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
now we can build for a little better

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,080
tools in that right now in a few months

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,780
well now if it wasn't good Berg and

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,630
[Music]

00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:21,420
perfect they they are meshing well

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,400
because all the page builders out there

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,830
like oh no our core markets been

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,530
disappeared with no arrest core do some

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,410
of the thing

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:32,650
that you've been promising and I think

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,900
already see is then bringing the the

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:37,719
unique business that they have into

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,419
Google Peter others people to dialect a

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,710
lot they focus a lot of energy could

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,470
great make all the modules engine blocks

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:50,430
and they can a lot of things

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:54,810
are saving models where you say bro

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:57,420
content content that they've helped

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:02,180
break too many personas where does have

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:05,300
I saved logical same-sex eight blocks

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,020
and template letters

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,940
I think the people that bring that TV

00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,680
thanks babe and see when we live in the

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,140
same well this was a divvy site it's

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,640
always going to be six well this visas

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,670
some things are getting into something

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,730
else and something simple WordPress

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:27,440
super maintained right it should be more

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:31,490
maintainable always believe it's up

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:35,480
there hurry back up check out the cloud

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,070
okay so I'm kind of the opposite the

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,880
first question we think is the biggest

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,880
weakness we have

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,940
at the moment it is important kind of

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,740
fundamental thing for my opinion ladies

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:55,750
it's some of the blacks you can't have

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:59,139
an accident in turn enlightenment the

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,770
two-column block for instance my little

00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:03,290
experimental

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:07,640
so proprietor point like I wouldn't

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,440
watch a site on right now that are

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,560
frustrated by those things you like I

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,350
want some kind of image

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,900
like any morning but I think those

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:22,810
little pills are on their list I'm sure

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,810
the divert we find out

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,470
that's one weakness rate on usability

00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,779
point right at this moment

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,209
from a development standpoint in my

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:37,029
opinion I don't know if I thought it'd

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:39,139
be just more referral is a lot of

00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,220
developers I think are used to be good

00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:45,410
old days there's like different BP files

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:50,769
about the opposite those three are

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,769
maintained - you know so they go to the

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,819
secondary market options gives us a

00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,560
dance point botfly it wants to get to

00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:59,720
the front but that's a you know those

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:05,690
three things right now this modern

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:10,040
cooling though it's like the stuff you

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:13,759
know don't look into like JavaScript yes

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,360
six rates next index and react how that

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:21,939
works and read up switch

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:28,119
and I need something green and then jazz

00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:30,639
X is in fact students and faculty so

00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:33,770
many like we think that it is part of

00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,420
the form a barrier for barrier that's

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:46,290
[Music]

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:48,850
one of the to lie demo another obstacle

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:54,129
is that for the longest time that's been

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:56,019
coming what's going on let me know when

00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:58,209
you're ready I'll be back and like so is

00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:01,420
going to be developers that now once it

00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:04,989
launches foliage that now are just

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:09,779
starting out pick up speed in tempers

00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:13,860
there's something there's going to be

00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,860
for a bit just a wide

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,779
[Music]

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:24,500
it's kind of rally together something

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:29,029
that's to that effect I have to reteach

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:32,370
webpack reactive things I think of the

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:34,600
things that they can

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,570
just if you're confident the Athens

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,160
training a good variable block but I

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,590
think we're gonna see more to link more

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,900
things to use that much

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:47,790
[Music]

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,520
perfect I think the biggest weaknesses

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,120
it still isn't right my content I want

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,279
to do that

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,779
as the arts part is coming up with the

00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:01,450
content also it still has a few

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,610
accessibility challenges rather than

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,770
introduced a ton of accessibility

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,260
problems but they're actively being

00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,270
worked out which is awesome so I think

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,370
that ultimately it is going to be one of

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:17,310
the more accessible web interfaces

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:20,700
but at the moment it's still being built

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,500
it forces the problems we confutatis

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:29,490
attack

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:31,980
[Music]

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:35,480
one of the concerns are that it is even

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,480
outside recipe

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,170
CSS and JavaScript

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,010
taking all of the problems that are

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,350
outside

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,350
full grades and open

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:59,980
we're animating starting about being

00:13:51,770 --> 00:14:04,030
more things every game well I think

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,030
there's a standard

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,990
[Music]

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,760
we still

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,190
they're trying to get everyone to

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,660
students in the modern way but things

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:25,639
change over time

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,639
[Music]

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:38,680
here's what we think is best

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:42,730
[Music]

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,100
I I know the can of writing things in

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,519
the way that's most so I kind of like

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,930
being able to kind of cometo my styling

00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,930
and my templating and

00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:58,119
that all together that's difficult

00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:59,559
maintain but the fact that in a single

00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:02,309
file I could write a little business

00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,309
accident

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:10,400
logic it's nice having all in one spot

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,500
we'll get opening at this while that and

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,900
having a build tool pull out the real

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,580
defense styling goes into the stylesheet

00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,640
all JavaScript because there is

00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:23,930
definitely its present in it

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:25,880
I can relate I haven't fully embracing

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,830
yet and I had this lovely relationship

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,930
we build tools like I like that they

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,930
exist and can do a lot of things for me

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,610
but I hate like okay before I can start

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:39,530
my project that's make sure these ten

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,880
things are all lined up Harvey said like

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:50,120
to

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:53,220
[Music]

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:58,339
these problems take a lot of mega

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,339
developer at my level ass I just feel it

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:08,350
huge happening import jobs

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:11,640
he first

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,640
start in the skillet

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:22,680
still they here

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:24,510
and where it gets you guys suck

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,550
I think this is a really good app to

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,960
everything about this a lot better are

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,340
you saying oh not everything including

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,800
the Java scripts will be so much harder

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,470
to beat WordPress now that there was so

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,990
many

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,340
and I think in reality just get do

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,310
people are going to wear different

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,620
things so when I was like I learned PHP

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,100
courtesy of learning to build inside

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:48,300
WordPress experimentation

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,250
everything was readable

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,720
just call this thing of this name of

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,230
that function

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,320
[Music]

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,720
so people jumping it now in order to

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,710
learn JavaScript persons it'll be to be

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,970
first

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:04,650
so the 11 most alert are us Guardian

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,380
trances are hollering another way of

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,380
doing things but a lot of that knowledge

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,260
is transferable in tonight's basically

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:17,040
this rating some new syntax and Larry

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:21,689
which is it is a big undertaking but

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:24,360
it's not and the nice thing about this I

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:26,760
need to ask this I'll just transfer a

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,950
little outside corner great start

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,500
learning introduce these fancy

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:34,770
JavaScript things which is was happening

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,460
largely outside of workouts in largely

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,460
the same way

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:46,050
I would say definitely applicable you

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,670
know for anybody anybody who is between

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,220
learning development you know I would

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:53,620
say like concepts are more important

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:57,880
this particular things work

00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:02,520
in general you know that like mothers

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:05,409
understand and use like sanity checks

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,190
for things in your code and you escape

00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:11,529
thing that Yahoo sanitize it

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,470
all those kinds of best practices like

00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:16,029
sitting - you learn them in the job

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,519
better - yes

00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:21,309
whenever other insert underlay materials

00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,289
all those concepts still alive right

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,330
like I was saying it's more just like

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,729
it's getting used to this new syntax a

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,940
new way of doing things in that language

00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:33,039
it might have some you know words to it

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,769
that blank to use you might not do the

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,720
number one look you know comparison of

00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:41,139
course because they are different but I

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,840
think if you like you know those metals

00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:56,610
in anything

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:59,390
[Music]

00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,390
you know

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:09,540
[Music]

00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,280
as their custom

00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,960
syntax voluntarily

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,200
[Music]

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,380
pasta

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,380
[Music]

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,650
so the cool thing is you don't think we

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,600
have to learn react you could you could

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,790
go about Billy said we work and never

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,700
actually learned a thing about react

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:39,170
which I know is true because I I haven't

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,360
I had been writing stuff for uber you'll

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,720
be much better off if you do you don't

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,480
have to West boss is really good react

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,120
for videos worse it's amazing things

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,240
react over here it's background jewelry

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,440
in abundance no best boss yes

00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,600
he transfers

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:04,280
to stay together exact coordinates

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,990
converted of course that I mentioned at

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,220
the end of science that you would have

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:12,260
heard that horses actually to do a joke

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,780
has voted it's all about using and

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,280
working with tumor we just perfectly are

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,720
like all of the things they can create

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,370
something new from effective we should

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,080
also be good to share with clients like

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,000
here's all the stuff that you're

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,770
learning about this new vendor

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,800
but then Zach Gordon sources all

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,990
development and the very beginning right

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,450
first are some basic JavaScript we're

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,270
gonna set up backward everything just

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,370
running basically and now we're ready to

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,130
build a block then these ten different

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,310
blocks walks through very simple very

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,510
relaxed

00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,510
[Music]

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,049
Hyatt's a comment and a question or

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,150
comment is could you repeat the

00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:59,840
questions oh yes do that

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:03,160
the question is everybody's encouraged

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,460
to take a mobile-first approach to

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,549
websites

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,790
okay does this what you see is what you

00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:14,270
get in Gutenberg contribute to that and

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:17,390
therefore save development time or is it

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:21,500
pretty much what you see is what you get

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,010
on a you know on your Big Mac that's a

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,510
big question

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,400
it could've been done precisely

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,770
the question that I was answering that

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,350
perhaps will repeat is where are good

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,030
places to go to learn all of this new

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,679
stuff that we're going to expect

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:38,580
figuring out produces the Tooth Fairy

00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:41,429
handling the reacts did you have a bad

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,500
batch so then uh the things you want

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:49,460
like just all this stuff like raining

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,460
alert react and hit first attachment and

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,799
there's also getting the code wait

00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,649
what's that

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:04,049
and then you start like a mechanic and

00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:10,359
it starts to slowly more tutorials in

00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:12,309
the code it'll start to just you just do

00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,149
them but if you want to take it further

00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,909
and

00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:18,799
oh yeah this is just way that like

00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:21,169
there's things that start to connect so

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,419
it just depends on can you get away with

00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:27,529
just it's magic it just works or do you

00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:29,799
get it I think there's a spectrum you'll

00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:35,349
be able to survive about learning back

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:44,809
yeah but I think if you want adventure

00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:48,049
solidify I would say so those guys that

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:51,469
I think already love them another wise

00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:56,689
even brighter unity

00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:58,420
they are super deep I react to his react

00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:00,580
forces

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,570
team hours that's a ripoff wait until

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,040
they kind of shoot them first 4:13 is

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,620
that the end of any life just like this

00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,480
era coupon codes their money off don't

00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,930
know whether they are people that

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:19,160
actually I got Stephen

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:21,580
it's a PhD and writer here

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:26,680
[Music]

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:29,830
and these are really good guess like

00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,090
read basic spells and then I can advance

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:35,140
like a poet is full the Lord is like

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,620
it's like we were sent out with somebody

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,440
else

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,050
you guys like you show me to start to

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,270
finish the listen laureate anything out

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,490
everything I need to do he just does

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,730
that we'll have no problem like you're

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,580
the first one it's pretty

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,169
they start to finish excited to it once

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,770
again for that the second one's a little

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:58,070
more complex start in like by the end of

00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:02,590
course both three things and second

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,590
third skill to learn

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:26,049
[Music]

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:31,690
yes actually I had the idea that you

00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:35,019
have to react before you want to do that

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:38,230
I like in reactors a difference all the

00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:39,850
stateless functional where just takes in

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,710
some products when there's something up

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,440
and there's something called a state

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:47,769
full employment right has internal state

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,600
that keeps I think if you're if you're

00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,519
making pretty simplistic blocks there's

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:58,179
that stateless functional component way

00:24:51,519 --> 00:25:02,529
and that's what really works in my head

00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,970
it does this because this if you're if

00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:05,760
you're building more complex block for

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:10,690
the gene subtracted there

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:13,790
stay out saying really need to know

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,560
extending its components and then to

00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:31,810
create the state object that you update

00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:34,700
different points around and also

00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:38,830
lifecycle methods to negative 14 Burke

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,830
you will notice some of their flocks

00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:53,450
[Music]

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,940
you will see that something called

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,500
anything you just have to know if you

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,880
know a little bit about reactor you know

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:06,010
that when it did now that's the thing

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,010
grapples automatic whatever

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,850
[Music]

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:15,220
the way the things like that before you

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,660
dig into it the more than employment

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,820
understand like the lifecycle a

00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:22,510
statement when you see them what Larry

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:25,150
likes and it how to update the state

00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,440
inside of it and some of you like it

00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,670
that's how they're here that every kind

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,700
you'll encounter needle with what

00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:33,370
internal state even means you know say

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,620
like don't start there's no simple super

00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:39,190
blocks and there's a need to track with

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:42,070
that then get to it like my worth

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,950
anybody with my talk earlier psychic

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:48,229
block the dynamic one dad some internal

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:52,710
state stages to do that

00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:55,480
she's traffic light will last less

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:59,069
interaction work and

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,069
[Music]

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:08,270
so the next question what answer with

00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,980
with mobile being such a big part of

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,320
what we do in mobile first being a

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,910
mentality that we've been striving

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,220
towards these last few years

00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:26,960
how does Gutenberg facilitate mobile

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:28,520
layouts I think there's also just wanted

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,920
to think about now is where could bring

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,290
us today and where I think you very much

00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,610
what I believe is that they're going to

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,610
keep inching closer and closer

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:48,060
I'm logged in and I'm on my site title

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:50,220
or so yes I think with that you're gonna

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:53,000
start to see if you saw his dog because

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,620
we said he chose the code that's right

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,970
there is style for the front end of the

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,970
backend party baked it

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,440
you can start to put those media queries

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,870
in those style sheets and start to have

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,900
your back in draft to that based on the

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:13,280
screen size I think that they're still

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:16,320
revealing about inspector tools

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,820
on the backend personal preference I

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,859
think there's something that you make

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,550
or use of that test up that thing around

00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:29,920
the corner

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:31,990
and then but for content I've noticed to

00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,260
is like a few months ago everybody was

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,970
panicking about that about how are they

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,370
gonna work they're gonna disappear skies

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,990
following its kitty cat

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,780
just has dogs living together mass

00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,510
hysteria and then they fixed it

00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,730
and it was fun to be right use it now

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,650
and so did to your question it is not

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,690
working I'm old now it doesn't mean it's

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,360
never gonna work out for Kelly he

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:58,060
brought up accessibility or its are

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,560
grinding it yeah there's some serious

00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,630
problems disability there doesn't mean

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,800
that booty burger that this state we're

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:08,530
just giving up yeah and to continue on

00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,900
your plate of eventually front end and

00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,810
back end will be seamless which mean

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,400
anything what is the present experience

00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:18,460
that experimentation is already

00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:22,740
happening the customizer that started

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:25,340
out the entire site experience

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,440
gave a lot of cool tech at last year's

00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,330
Guttenberg is coming and the tester team

00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,030
of the new earth team defense playing

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,620
with many ideas together so that you're

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,920
working the Guttenberg and the

00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:40,590
customizing simultaneously and it's

00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:45,420
clunky right now there's nothing done

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:49,110
but it paints a really neat look very

00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,840
safe have you been uh recently I read

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:55,380
about some I'm give up where somebody

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,990
has more experimentation anything else

00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,059
as explode convert to define over

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,490
precisely it's like where the pain was

00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:04,470
usually you know be on the right side

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:08,900
Esprit Indiana very showing they're on

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:11,040
the front end they're interesting

00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:15,700
[Music]

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:21,340
yeah what's the Middle East or

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:26,830
and are you guys using production sites

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:29,440
for clients right now the question to

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,950
reiterate the camera diamond inheritance

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,560
what's the projected release date for

00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:38,320
Guttenberg merging into core and are any

00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:45,750
of us using the grouper plugin as is on

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:45,750
a production site anything nobody knows

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:58,030
this 5.0 is striving for and you all

00:30:54,430 --> 00:31:00,400
probably familiar WordPress is like

00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:03,580
annual means they create one I write

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,860
2013 like there wasn't one this year

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:11,890
because they a lot of work to do with

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:14,140
all their all their effort to get ready

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,270
that's where all the audiences is right

00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:20,230
now my language no backlog of

00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:22,929
accessibility issues to address and

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:28,269
things I've mentioned about

00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:28,269
like 600 open issue that get

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:40,670
total open closed yeah so it sounds like

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:43,130
there's a lot yeah just to there yeah

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,750
[Music]

00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:47,760
parts about this project is it sounds a

00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,350
little scary it doesn't have a specific

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,450
timeline because they want to do it but

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:55,590
it's ready as opposed to choose a

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:58,410
monster every day and receiving I'm

00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:05,010
getting about taking longer than but

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:07,950
that's okay in December there was a lot

00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:12,720
of optimism that it could be done by

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:14,580
April and Tuesday it would be made

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,910
because everybody has to look at account

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,230
easily it is not ready yet last I heard

00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,930
was the shooting for this year so

00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,500
hopefully this year but I think the

00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,500
longer that

00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,250
any items that I think that is such a

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:43,400
huge shift quite oppressive but for so

00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:47,090
long that I intentionally we're not

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,669
using right now for the images columns

00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:53,840
whatever else I think you know the

00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:58,860
baseline baseline for like whether you

00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:02,279
use it right now not me is it worse than

00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:04,700
and the answer is getting certain things

00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,110
like you might admit that I think

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:12,679
probably one make sure you all those

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:15,779
things before layering on to you and all

00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,490
the other night here right now we're

00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:23,460
going to gravy just like focus

00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:25,200
horsepower what block what do you do

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,710
plan on using on client projects with

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,730
some of the patients routine and then on

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:36,529
top of that was like y'all really

00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,529
thought that we ran out of everybody

00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:44,510
well we've got some such that our

00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,850
public's basic they're not the clients

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:49,700
that are managing so if a site can be

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:54,309
simple enough to be just a bamf layout

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,309
we've got a hero image and like content

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,039
we've done in Houston many accidents

00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:08,250
you're saying I don't think I would turn

00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:10,660
it over to apply it to you it's not

00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,880
[Music]

00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:19,420
sessions in the next couple of months

00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:22,599
right there in employment

00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,599
[Music]

00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:29,520
so the question is can you enable for

00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,520
some civic post types and right now I

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,700
think that is yes I think by default

00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:39,240
it's enabled everywhere but you can

00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:45,389
explicitly say jump looking for anything

00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:48,720
except this one first human-made is one

00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:52,050
example their agency base everyday they

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,149
rebuilt their own site focusing at

00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:57,210
Newburgh and wrote the beautiful one for

00:34:54,149 --> 00:35:02,870
detailing some of the challenges they

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:07,370
say it's cryptically hmm and dot and

00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,370
human agency robots

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,469
[Music]

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:35,839
I've got like two and a half over v1

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:43,990
will Cooper be mandatory is it the

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:43,990
largest overhaul and if so and

00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:57,830
the video when he gets released it will

00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,830
be rolled out as yet there's a plugin

00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:07,329
classic that plugin is installed

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,329
shuts down

00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:17,860
great I'm going to be do you notice that

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,860
you want to

00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:29,489
otherwise I believe is the current

00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,489
[Music]

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:39,329
the biggest overhaul ever from my

00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:41,700
recollection and press DPI this looks

00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:47,630
because those two things like it's like

00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,630
a toy box and letting to talk downstairs

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,190
[Music]

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,190
it's

00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:24,049
[Music]

00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:28,509
I say we had a third question of all

00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:28,509
students but what makes

00:37:38,890 --> 00:38:24,170
so strong suits

00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:29,299
I like closer because it's coming super

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:31,069
get these all the time but it's eat all

00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:33,859
of their strong suits and then doing

00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:35,390
them a underlying based alarm so that

00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:37,230
whether you switched from this strong

00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,360
area

00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:44,440
[Music]

00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:46,890
Slyder carousel hold that now to play on

00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,040
a level playing field any swamp in there

00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:54,310
so yes I think there's a lot more to it

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,030
and that when when it watches six months

00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,030
there is

00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:04,210
the biggest who I change was actually

00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:07,090
from WordPress 2.5 to 2.6 makers

00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:09,490
requesting 2.7 we're complete at

00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,460
interface change and has a horizontal

00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:15,100
image crop top and late than what was

00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,560
known as the Crazy Horse layout to test

00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,510
the dedication outside and probably the

00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,660
many many wonderful refinements that

00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:25,390
have been period up to mm which is awful

00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:28,360
this is the single biggest change to the

00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:32,440
editor since WordPress is creating that

00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,670
tiniest since the beginning and next

00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,940
problem is all of the wonderful

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:39,670
challenges that and that will get rid of

00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,280
that to make what should be as I said a

00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,930
very smooth with editing experience to

00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,410
start tightening as you're getting

00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:49,480
tender Primavera is putting it we block

00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:52,150
to never realize and you have a little

00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,580
extra light to rope a lot of people list

00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:57,430
and back at this with three separate

00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:00,940
aircraft blocks to one single bullet in

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:04,720
this block you say oh no I do that goes

00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:11,750
back to its doing lots of really

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:18,350
and Judith worry about seamless that's

00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:19,880
why it's so nice you're saying their

00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,850
well-being has changed

00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,980
rusty I was like a huge animal it

00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:29,890
changed open up a whole bunch of

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,890
different ways average you

00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:38,029
yeah yeah yeah and of the other things

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:44,890
and related to sites like being updated

00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,420
to WordPress and the option to use

00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:49,370
classic plus together

00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,770
one thing important things to know that

00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:55,100
thing is that when we forecast it will

00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,870
be a major release not release so that

00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,730
mean that make you may not WordPress

00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:01,910
now that's automatic updates for point

00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:07,360
releases but not major so you never have

00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:07,360
to worry about my last item it you know

00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,230
it early you it'll be an intentional

00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,480
action object okay fun and intentionally

00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,750
like know you're going through my window

00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:40,739
please just be aware of that

00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:40,739
[Music]

00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:52,559
[Music]

00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:54,930
as developers which I'm not use if you

00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,539
use a beaver builder or element or

00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:00,089
hormone do you think that the

00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:04,619
information would be preferred will

00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:08,609
result in leaner faster loading sites

00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:10,469
built with these fake builders another

00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:13,380
developer you're thinking and like super

00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:17,099
great your questions so they your

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,380
questions are amazing so thank you yeah

00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:22,519
the question was Louis like all these

00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:26,190
things moving to Guber lead to faster

00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:29,590
load times I think it's and reason why

00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:32,300
is because to pull off a lot of that not

00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:34,160
if you look at like the panel of the

00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,230
console and little boats floating it's a

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,390
lot of JavaScript web style everything

00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,700
that gets injected like at runtime so

00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,590
all that current to be optimized through

00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:46,780
WordPress form and also for just the

00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:52,730
standardized equipment so inevitably yes

00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:55,550
there's still a chance that yes so it

00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,960
should move in faster speed your way I

00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,390
can't say forever

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,240
yeah that's a that's generally true

00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:03,830
there are some layout editors that are

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,350
already good actors and they compile

00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:08,960
everything down to HTML the post content

00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:11,600
so there is no real time stuff for a

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,850
flows others that are with respect to

00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,640
the fluid point

00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:17,920
they're short codes or how we insert

00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,990
complicated things into our content area

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,330
now that's just stupid

00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:30,580
now you just have a block there is

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:38,140
almost a simple picture of text next to

00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:45,300
the layout and markup I got out of that

00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:49,870
simple insane as it is to inline style

00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:53,130
food burgers just picture plot next to

00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:53,130
an inferior simple

00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,069
it rocks my chinchilla but I want to

00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:01,069
thank

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,730
as if questions come up and asking us

00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,400
afterwards

00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:12,330
yes be amazed yes how do you talk

00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,280
downstairs we let me because he is

00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:17,710
coming to mind from earlier just find

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,110
her around all day and we love talking

00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:22,110
about this stuff so I just order us

00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:30,090
