[Music]

00:00:34,570 --> 00:02:10,720
you know everybody all four or five

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,720
years

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,060
some might dynamic for web apps

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:29,020
and I've actually used for us as a

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:33,040
fragrant for chillax eating restaurant

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:35,080
or a while funnyman is that or my years

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,880
ago I thought I was just a blocking

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,880
so never thought I was gonna be utility

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,940
so I spent the last three years

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,720
forget I'm a disease smaller time bakers

00:02:48,940 --> 00:03:07,440
so I were dressed in a halter that

00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:10,660
helped her dress I was so I have a

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:16,410
pretty one great experience working

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:16,410
under ten industry currently feelings

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,200
and also as I'm looking to the top I'll

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,200
just stop me

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,049
so my main objective is to outline

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,140
different produce to react - Oh

00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,970
Christine

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:52,600
most of these protests and b-52 of other

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:59,350
other frameworks but I particular use

00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:03,430
yeah I mean you know what we act as how

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:08,200
many people should be out do you use

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:11,350
react in WordPress so I want you to feel

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,070
how are you gonna act like just as that

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:18,120
I can stand alone

00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:18,120
yeah I have a higher view but sure

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,390
foundation

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,730
okay so the way you journal about your

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,880
injury they like hosted two different

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:37,690
our mentors so are essentially community

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:56,230
so lady pop decouples yes the interest

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:58,300
here but I'm going to be many more great

00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,500
love seeing us versus helpless as

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,240
there's no walls during the PowerPoint I

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,090
found he continued that someone was

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:13,930
doing these exact I was gonna do so I

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:20,560
came to life crime so again so the

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:23,800
motivation like said I had two problems

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,810
and everyone just front had like a giant

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,050
widget they were also in the back end

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,930
where none of my friends is a DJ yes but

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:39,640
list that he makes Spotify I created a

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:42,820
plugin for him to sink that into and so

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,660
to do that I realized I can't just use

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:51,610
my like Tito JavaScript functionality I

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:55,720
wanted to also JavaScript frameworks I

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,420
ended up flipping it because I actually

00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,550
have a background in your I used

00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,710
abundant and Euler beat up and it's

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:06,190
great for years ago but that's there

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,850
wasn't actually you know I started to

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:19,210
see too happy a community for home

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:22,810
fitness but it turned out so that was a

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:27,430
newer to watch poorly came up with a go

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:31,510
to and after that I got a job and we had

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:34,920
our own internal framework so then you

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,920
know and you're asking

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:51,300
so I knew I was kind of stuck between

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:53,590
the act view and we act human January I

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,500
really I kind of played with angular

00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,470
there's too many paths of the different

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,660
versions each pass along next able to

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:09,010
support you remind me of a anywhere

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:11,110
that's contained anything but I can

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,430
understand why you prefer you know

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,890
especially for like something two setups

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,690
that I was going through a few seeming

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,270
capacities resistance

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,970
my main reason for fission reaction lism

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:25,750
career I did because there's enough job

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:29,770
postings that for me AK third accomplice

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:34,210
for web apps that could mean that use me

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:37,540
act and there instead and realistically

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:43,090
things easier to compete the list web

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:58,150
apps that don't that that's them too so

00:07:43,090 --> 00:08:02,400
that's where that concepts and it build

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:05,830
a possible like fundamentals of react so

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,750
on top of that I went to word gave us a

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:15,670
knock on 16 and during the off state of

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:19,150
the word they announced Calypso sothe an

00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:23,190
entire you and an experience which is

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:27,250
why right now where it's filled with

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:30,340
entire JavaScript no teach westwards

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,370
nodejs back-end and it's using react

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,860
right and so they released that with I

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,790
think an eventual goal to replace the

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:43,210
current WordPress admin with that even

00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:45,470
for the network's there's sort of a

00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:50,010
novena

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:54,230
it's this there's some things to it but

00:08:50,010 --> 00:09:01,020
ultimately one that Altman and that top

00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:03,150
Matheson's that there gospel to heart

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,070
because I was already interested in

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,490
learning JavaScript and once I saw that

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:11,640
that word breast was going you just

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:15,860
that's for me so that's kind of why I

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:21,270
got a chance and it became the medical

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:23,970
present their work okay so there are a

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:27,660
couple couple ways to add data to a

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:33,380
project there is just padding a CDN like

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,380
we're all adding it into your site

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:43,140
unless you really want to like just get

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:47,100
up in my experience I see an expense but

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,620
there are so much into like modern

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,560
JavaScript that make your life a lot

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:57,810
easier if you use the new options which

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,530
is Facebook has that repository you're

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,040
told

00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm yet other where you pull it down and

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,160
it kind of generates and scaffolds like

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,940
every community but it also creates an

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,080
environment that it just makes it easy

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,970
to not only just start building with but

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,850
also they have some tools that when

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:25,160
you're ready put in five you can just

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,160
come from from that excellent so

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,280
unfortunately I'm one of those people

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,280
that needs to know everything

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:41,760
I don't work with black boxes I need to

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:43,620
know of it so that's how radical one

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,650
started for whatever doesn't okay well

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,110
we'll just see what's going on and that

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,510
led into a lot of a lot of work in this

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,770
so I would use this creatively on that

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,400
how to pull it down

00:10:52,770 --> 00:11:11,760
I mean how what

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:14,250
great now I looked at how how it builds

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,710
the files and time but ultimately

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:21,090
reduces some static file index.html

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:26,070
Stiles

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:29,910
excuse us file no so I said well kind of

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:33,870
- take that code and compile our custom

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,480
plugin and just like link to it I would

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,120
think so but there's a lot more

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,680
complications to it being that like

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,040
every time you change something in the

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:48,450
app but if it have like something

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,070
different like numbers to it and so the

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,290
management just be difficult especially

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,770
because this is feeling the project

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,690
extreme full-time you know so I had

00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:01,950
about a two people - having puppies and

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:04,500
of course there'd be too many updated so

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,680
it just became very day so the positive

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,100
approach is very tough did you do the

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,290
test you pretty much at least know me

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,580
being a PHP developer book into

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:20,930
JavaScript there's a lot of tools I

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:24,720
hacked has some suggest assistant

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:28,430
unlearn which is respect files

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,190
so web path babble and they have like

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:42,840
each side JavaScript and X so it wasn't

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:45,330
just there like I'm gonna share the

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,180
younglings but I'm really gonna be just

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:56,220
talk now creatively actin heavily just

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:59,540
gonna go basic in custom excluded but

00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,540
Japan time

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:11,500
together allow to add reactive with that

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:14,110
all becoming stuff and then the comes

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,170
with because they obviously have one

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:20,160
suggested which still is great for

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,780
learning when you have their custom

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,600
custom environment custom libraries we

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,600
need to keep all that stuff out and just

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,620
getting into it so I was just having a

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,620
conversation

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:49,360
well you know like nugu catchy phrases

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:53,500
and tell us CMS is probably something

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,680
you can see consistently I don't hold me

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,680
to it

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:22,360
so headless CMS kind of relies on

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:25,000
restful you take what they provide but

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,130
so in Ellis you know Specter progresses

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,360
so right now when you have a serving

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,360
admin experience and it's also started

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,010
with a headless a mess you you're

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,790
basically cutting out the front end so

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:45,220
that actually posted like we were just

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,620
lucky couple structure we're like I can

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,400
post my products panicbasket where and

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:54,730
then may consumes from an epi

00:14:51,400 --> 00:15:00,340
so the helicity mask means the WordPress

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:04,860
experience is like for a madman but that

00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,860
content is now spit out into arrest

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,870
so that's what matters so it's it's

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,669
really beautiful forty couple structures

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,290
that have company

00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:17,479
information architecture and if you're

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,540
building these pop popcorn apps or

00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:23,869
anyone a things where they have a mobile

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,859
app or I'm building something with an

00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:27,290
echo

00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:30,829
for example but I'm consuming from the

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:33,529
same yeah so come to see miss beautiful

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:35,720
for that because all in all my client

00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:37,489
has to do is upload and the same patent

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,859
instruments that they're expecting but

00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:41,899
canal where their content is everywhere

00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:44,059
so there are people who are downloading

00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,419
the skill listening to the same block or

00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:47,600
something

00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:50,149
go Beach on the phone like that

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,339
experience at sculpture and the nice

00:15:50,149 --> 00:16:02,479
thing is if I ever want to change how

00:15:52,339 --> 00:16:04,129
you find so if I have a model yeah I can

00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:06,679
change the front end without affecting

00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,809
the back leg less if I everyone's on

00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,319
WordPress because there are other

00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:15,319
students and there are a lot more other

00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:17,899
solutions communities are nobody's

00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,999
recipe so the other one drop the word

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:23,359
this experience and low for another she

00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:25,819
has a patent to that and married without

00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:28,100
affecting the front end for the most

00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:34,489
part they're making some euros exchanged

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:37,910
some minimum minimum like whereas

00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:40,579
brainlessly message probably the typical

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,649
practice or boost s cause if you met I

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:46,189
didn't react independent equal booking

00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:48,739
because that's how because I'm a

00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:52,459
terrific single page single page

00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:54,949
experiences and my websites but it's

00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:58,819
always like there's still multiple pages

00:16:54,949 --> 00:17:01,100
but there's not one page that is weird

00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:03,259
in that one it's just a simple seven

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,990
page template that includes a jobs

00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,889
company that's how it renders so that's

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,679
a bonus

00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:12,769
ray maecenas you're relying on the rest

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:17,139
to deliver meaning versus the habit

00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:17,139
where you have kind of young

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,709
and so like I said I'm called upon for

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,350
today's pretend it down I'm not going to

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:34,010
do that with a mess mostly because

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:42,470
there's blood you start out there right

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:46,330
now but the brain listening us if mostly

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:49,720
because that's really how how this whole

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:52,910
me because there weren't enough losers

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,680
and so I'd like to fail and then I can

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,810
do great listening messes if you already

00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,510
have a custom site you don't have to

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:03,230
replace the entire thing with react you

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:05,930
can just add small components react like

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:09,350
widgets for example so like if you have

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:11,780
a blog post the Lincoln's challenge what

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,660
I have more interactions to it for

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:18,800
example I can do that not having to do

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:21,560
like me writing hire site which is nice

00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,750
especially if you look like an actor it

00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,750
allows you to enhancing

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:49,240
large site backbone it's like kind of

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:52,460
drumming I've actually met that CEO Lee

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,060
it's it's growing and it's actually one

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,090
hosting can you react documentation and

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,740
use computation with their sites so

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,960
there there are all those experiences

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:18,350
with static sites or static site

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:24,509
generators so there's a lot more job

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:28,850
so don't babysit but it's there are more

00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,850
out there but those are the those really

00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:37,740
is the thing with headless EMS so the

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:42,210
idea behind it is for one of my clients

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,490
they use Facebook pages so I'm an

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,250
imposter only using WordPress to just

00:19:44,490 --> 00:20:04,919
keep up their data so that their data

00:19:47,250 --> 00:20:10,980
but they are actually so the ID would

00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:27,059
have had a sense of the bathroom if I do

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:30,240
it very so that's the advantage and I

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:33,600
mean I haven't recommend if you can

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,320
going towards the headless structure and

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:44,580
that's more coming if you have an

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:45,899
existing site just to give more of a

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,289
visual idea

00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:50,909
so brilliance brilliance is really a

00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:59,629
database um of the WordPress time point

00:20:50,909 --> 00:21:04,590
and then you know a mobile website and

00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:07,409
instead with the head of us now you have

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:10,019
layer leeches the WordPress CMS is just

00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:13,049
giving you JSON data and now you can

00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:15,600
build whatever hindsight back so to be

00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:18,240
mobile and be website it could be it in

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,149
a lot of peppers go or what happened and

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,580
and the nice thing is you build all

00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:28,879
those all those experiences without

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:30,690
having to affect the back end like so

00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:34,680
those are just a standard

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:38,280
from reacts documentation is w an added

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,280
from CEM you didn't use this w PDQ

00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,410
script and you can add at the scene

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,180
again you were also in a development

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:50,730
environment and production production

00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:52,950
and system performance and development

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,560
allows you to make extra debugging in

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,750
the browser and again

00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,060
I don't look recommend doing this unless

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:09,060
we did Lantis encounter picks a mobster

00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:13,230
later problems react and then so to do

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:18,650
the cream react that sort of requires a

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:21,870
note which have to install bumpers it's

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:24,840
probably their practice note it sonic it

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:28,290
don't there's a lot of packages to Manta

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,690
so there's two different instructions no

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:34,860
version and I just have to deal with

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:37,410
this earlier this week with using all

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:41,100
like family newer version no so a lot of

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:44,060
my cactus weren't so bottom bottom

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,040
example is if you John if you went home

00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,410
today and God I know you're probably

00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,850
going to go with lot example and top

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:56,270
because that's the beautiful structure

00:22:52,850 --> 00:23:02,520
I'm a million other friends really a

00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:06,380
contactable but I guess it's tough so

00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,380
yeah now

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:45,289
it's like on my side Eddie I said so

00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:49,049
I've put together a very very basic beam

00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:51,500
structure so all you need to remember is

00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:55,590
an indexed stuff HP product and style

00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:59,340
and this tells us the SS pop you really

00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:03,330
just even as close snippet from codex or

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:06,779
developer wordpress.org and this is this

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:11,309
is really the very feminine in terms of

00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:13,230
my index Tepe pop so you know react

00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:14,940
example you're gonna have some sort of

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,590
deal for the night to eat and that's how

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,570
they'll react knows have already

00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:25,590
rendered its content into a page and so

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:29,549
I just added just basic page template

00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:37,200
code very very bare-bones and then in my

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:40,139
function is file my function is well I

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,880
have the two kind of a cute little

00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:47,700
scripts here first one is to the boat

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,490
CSS so I get the stylesheet behind the

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,960
main CSS this is what's actually going

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,720
to be built

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,710
once I have to create react experience

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:02,039
in nerd so all that I change is what

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:04,139
these things apart and I further better

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,029
develop processes but this is just to

00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:14,370
kind of show you like how to just pack

00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:17,340
up what this is you this is how many

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:19,889
just under their actual experience they

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,750
react so their default behaviors name

00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:24,570
and so it's using poverty or caller

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:27,750
suggest some other suggestions but that

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:30,659
isn't really the quickest way and also

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,090
because when you when you spin it up and

00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:37,769
out actually look like people all the

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,549
other cool stuff so I upgraded and for

00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:43,170
somebody tonight

00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:50,550
I always unregistered she created this

00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:53,250
- oxygen so let's go back and slide like

00:25:50,550 --> 00:26:24,510
it said they have a different way to do

00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:35,040
things like it's so yes so now that it

00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:43,710
mo talked to install react it's gonna

00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:45,420
set up all the dependencies any so so

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:54,060
first of all mine go in there I'm gonna

00:26:45,420 --> 00:27:00,360
just run the development running against

00:26:54,060 --> 00:27:11,430
time sometimes possible and of course I

00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:34,770
never read any models are there any

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:37,650
questions just a little bit sure so even

00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:44,130
work so this is a kind of hack for you

00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:46,380
but this bottle structure that together

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,070
so this might cost of one where I have

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:55,009
my own web text

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:58,639
like so so this this allows me to

00:27:55,009 --> 00:28:00,889
install whatever modern no packages I

00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:03,440
want into it in terms of the file

00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:11,629
structure is without to you so what I'm

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:14,749
doing here is so so this is another root

00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:16,879
directory so like oil may be content

00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:20,179
themes you might have this into whatever

00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:22,249
they call it and then for me when I'm

00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:26,600
doing to this creative be honest in this

00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:28,100
front folder that way all the known

00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,850
packages that beautiful for frying

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:34,789
statement the reason I have a different

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,379
setup here is because I'm taking common

00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:40,490
themes and I want to have everything

00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:43,129
wrapped into the web pack so that I can

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,860
actually get Java packages and still

00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:49,179
control them a little bit better so like

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:52,100
that for this it's more so things

00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:54,499
because I can also host this summer so I

00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,080
wanted to keep this proof whereas this

00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:59,960
is creepy activist now just front-end

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,869
folder and so if I want to post it I

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,019
post that folder somewhere else all

00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:08,149
right host it with it but I mean I've

00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:11,330
seen some message structures too

00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:13,730
so in terms of what what it's got so

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:21,159
these are the these are the files that

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:21,159
folders that we have has I'm just

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:39,580
so first then I just run the command so

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:42,039
it's an app it's gonna come out so this

00:29:39,580 --> 00:30:02,230
can compile everything so I'm just gonna

00:29:42,039 --> 00:30:04,240
go and cue it so now this if this is

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,390
gonna hook up should open up in the

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,390
browser

00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:17,220
so it has to change anything in the

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,220
front-end folder you'll see the changes

00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:22,860
the production

00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,420
[Music]

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,570
so in the production of happiness this

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,160
directory just got built and so we have

00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,350
some static files that's created and

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,630
some other funds so I don't recommend

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:44,100
this in terms of hosting it comes to

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:48,630
hosting actually because it creates an X

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:52,950
file but it makes the static directory

00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:57,030
in Corning has the CSS and the jump so

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:59,460
all I'm going to do is change stuff here

00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:06,330
which I guess I don't want to change

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:08,610
this so I use a little bowl but I will

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,140
for my development environment so I'm

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:14,250
ever precious and it's kind of things

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,410
should look at the entire state yeah and

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:21,440
so you don't see the little bit of the

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:24,809
inner testing included but but here's

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,200
Peters react and now my page so if I

00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:27,200
want to

00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:47,859
[Music]

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,810
this will like their bonus I got hungry

00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:33,830
I got ready to render but I want to show

00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:33,830
you yes I like mine compiled or just

00:32:41,640 --> 00:33:43,320
so easy so that's the beauty of using

00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:46,990
more modern modern structures more

00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:55,030
single component based structure which

00:33:46,990 --> 00:34:00,419
makes it easier to maintain so you can

00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:04,210
see look reactive have CSS and what

00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:09,010
reactor does this actually build up in

00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:12,690
the next step HTML file over here with

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,690
with the CSS file

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:40,510
so this performance so that's so that's

00:34:34,540 --> 00:35:01,869
how I attempted AI to be active and to

00:34:40,510 --> 00:35:03,910
do this in terms of all structure I may

00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:07,150
be reason I went into this talk I went

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:12,309
to a couple other tops what was because

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:14,230
I'm really into like how when you when

00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:17,260
you realize that God is faithful in

00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,780
develop how they go by what they look

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,839
like with that's the question I think I

00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:25,720
can support but now with this this gives

00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:29,559
you a better eye structure well you

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:33,000
still put your theme make sure you don't

00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,000
upload your modules

00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:44,680
sir Griffith I'll just add weight to the

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:49,900
server so what you can upload in terms

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:52,510
of all you really need is this so you

00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,510
can either deploy the entire directory

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:59,710
or Kingdom global and I'll make those

00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:17,530
two files but however you choose to do

00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:21,160
it just make sure that actually most of

00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:24,430
us would probably stay the same in terms

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,869
of in terms of angular this is why I

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:30,630
ended up having to reverse engineer this

00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:34,450
because I wanted that custom intro and

00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:36,010
also with us my combat game it was

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,190
enterprise so we came in actually as we

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,190
actually

00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,360
together and so for that I still want to

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,090
leverage the market and stuff and the

00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,750
way of that is probably more moreso

00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:55,200
power than this so every day at angular

00:36:51,750 --> 00:37:02,550
do anything or any modern learning a

00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:06,270
bungler so for example tool and works

00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:11,490
really well with reactive but there are

00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:16,020
commendation from you and so just so

00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:18,990
this one actually I don't think okay

00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:24,090
yeah so Mike well there's some

00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:27,420
configurations I have of this what panic

00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:29,880
escape just looks for JavaScript files

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:33,840
says use that also now you can use the

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:40,320
same ESS stuff that we saw and in the

00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:41,730
app source functionality so most of this

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,170
would work except that you would have

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,170
control over the functionality

00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:51,930
so this is just it looks at the

00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,660
JavaScript for JavaScript I'll compile

00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:59,510
them and

00:37:53,660 --> 00:38:01,670
html5 for it so in terms of using using

00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:04,250
a Europe you do time go the same way

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:13,160
unless they also have their own like you

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:16,600
know or whatever yeah when you said that

00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,600
you started this

00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,400
[Music]

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,090
[Music]

00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:49,220
so I started learning react probably

00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:49,220
like last year early last April I didn't

00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:59,190
but honestly I was able to grasp reacts

00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:02,670
concepts and without a weekend but

00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:07,049
anyway I watched a couple like I got

00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:08,760
some courses on udemy and I liked that

00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:11,579
site because they actually constantly

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,079
update their videos usually and so I

00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:16,200
found some videos and I just all along

00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:19,170
with everything and coincidentally I had

00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:23,130
a job interview behind week and I have

00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:25,230
to build something very similar so I so

00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,920
I mean it comes down to how much time

00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:31,380
you have like I spent my entire weekend

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,920
on Friday night or Saturday night and I

00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,270
spent you know a solid six hour probably

00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,110
watch them in your doing anything

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:42,810
they're doing and just try to

00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:44,880
in terms of in terms of how comfortable

00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:48,810
I am of this you know I'm speaking now

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:54,810
and I this stuff like just as humble as

00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:57,000
we can now but I think I know what I'm

00:39:54,810 --> 00:40:00,150
doing I have all these scattered notes

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:07,710
everywhere blood like two contacts

00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:10,080
happen so and the easiest thing the best

00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:32,660
thing to do is make the easier decisions

00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:39,880
for me and I learn but unfortunately I

00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:39,880
[Music]

00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,870
suppose this

00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,030
[Music]

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,480
[Music]

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:15,749
over there time in between

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:15,749
[Music]

00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,139
[Music]

00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,269
