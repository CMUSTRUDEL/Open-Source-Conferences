Title: Kim Kaiser: Donâ€™t Shard Your Pants! A WordPress   Amazon Domain Sharding Solution for Images
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Detroit 2018
Description: 
	Web browsers limit the number of active connections for each domain, but browsers distinguish domains by name rather than by IP address. Domain sharding, in which content is split across multiple subdomains, may drastically improve the user experience of slow page load times for image-heavy pages, but only if your server has sufficient bandwidth. Uploading content to Amazon S3 and using CloudFront to serve images from multiple subdomains has been shown to be an effective way to use domain sharding. In addition, when images are uploaded to S3, a Node.js script is triggered which creates thumbnails and the larger web versions of the full sized, high resolution images. The final step happens during the creation of a WordPress custom post type, where the domain sharding is actually applied.

a charming solution which is your server

00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:43,860
which is qualifies for the WordPress

00:00:38,850 --> 00:01:08,670
apparently and she worked for several

00:00:43,860 --> 00:01:15,000
fortune 500 items she so about the

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:17,220
application is over Asians it's based in

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,310
New Jersey and they are company that

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,540
places videographers photographers and

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,580
DJs and efficient outlets and though

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,270
there's only about five permanent staff

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,180
people living Janet celebrations they

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:36,150
would put their contractors and hundreds

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,920
of weddings every year primarily during

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,900
the summer months dirty area so when

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,780
you're gonna talk like this always want

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,909
to tough story and so I have to ask

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,970
myself am I gonna tell this story from

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,740
another developer or am I going to tell

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,930
the story to the point of view of the

00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:00,270
user or the program but when I'm going

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,310
to try to mix it up and show you a

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:08,660
little bit about you know

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,680
developer and solve problems some of my

00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:16,100
training before I became a wordpress

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,530
personal and I created and taught

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,790
consulting skills and consulting skills

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,069
teaches you how to go in and be a useful

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,280
consultant consultant that people listen

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,110
to come back for and a lot of times we

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,060
get involved in a project especially if

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,860
you're higher than three dancer you're

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,230
gonna see what they call the presenting

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,900
problem so people are going to come to

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,060
you and say this isn't work and it's

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:46,760
very easy to get focused on trying to

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:52,450
solve that problem and not really

00:02:46,760 --> 00:03:02,450
understand what is the real what the

00:02:52,450 --> 00:03:04,250
problem is you know so they talk about

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,440
this application that it had been

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,870
channel embraces company in VidCon and

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:14,150
it make cards are a custom post type and

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,329
what they do is they provide content on

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:21,620
posting of the thousands of images that

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:24,799
are generating now we need to be that

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,110
user photographic film you can take

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,630
hundreds of pictures but when the

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,989
digital revolution came around digital

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,480
people they're generating thousands of

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:38,030
pictures and there are lists of them

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,880
will post pictures from vents they

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,060
typically take down 30 days or 60 days

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,859
and enchanted celebrations realize that

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,380
people like to come back like a year

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,690
later and look at their images and they

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,299
learn to share and respect we use this

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,180
as a marketing tool because as you'll

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:58,280
see each event car is linked to a

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,160
location where the laconic

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,829
so when the marketing people are talking

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,970
to someone who's considering to hire a

00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,829
photographer

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:11,220
that was a where are you getting married

00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:13,770
so we're getting married and we Ellis in

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,519
in New Jersey and they can go into their

00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:19,440
event cart sir boom and come up today

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,390
well here we go we have a wedding that

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,520
we did it for Calais and here's all the

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,190
great pictures that we took of the

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,320
wedding right there at the gallows in

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,110
addition to that these images that

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,020
becomes have also two links to some

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,690
cheering you can share features from

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,670
your wedding on Facebook whatever and

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,400
the link that you have will bring you

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:45,060
back into the application into the light

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,520
box that opens to show you the image so

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,280
when you have that one of the images is

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,920
getting a link back to the page

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,870
thousands of images were useful so it's

00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,120
that deep linking and some of the

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,960
functionality that we have on the event

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,440
cards that became a complication for how

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
it worked

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:15,150
let's take that car came in James way

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,919
this works really well for a skill for

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,440
these folks because they do hundreds of

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,070
weddings a year and every single wedding

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,810
of the tissue they put a post out that

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,540
has that information so it talks about

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:31,020
event it talks about where happened is

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,300
location so you get a lot of SEO out of

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,030
this it's not something that they have

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,460
to sync up what am I going to write it

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,740
out from our post a post for every

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,150
single event and you can scroll down

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,430
here you'll see we get into this section

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,650
where you have like a French sheet they

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,370
can see even to come after a

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:58,740
photographer and each one of B is local

00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:01,740
photographs the lightbox overlay here's

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,900
the fou-fou box on your leg like I say I

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,570
really like it because the links that

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:10,860
you find in social media will take you

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:13,980
back exactly to this view

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,080
and that is something that is much more

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,020
user-friendly than just jamming it back

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,140
to a page with thousands of images you

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:26,510
can see a little bit of them so we're

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:29,550
going to happen along the weight here

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:32,220
each one of these sections here to

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:38,970
support different point in the process

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:43,200
here we even have premix so pictures of

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:46,520
groom just the picture that you want to

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,520
share on your social media sites

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,680
so we one of the things that that we do

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,690
this is what I do this we was trying to

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,050
define it that's a lotta money to

00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,450
subscribe down hard once it stood by the

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:04,170
section that didn't see my tin vessel is

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:08,850
divided into two sections right on right

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:12,720
- but when I think to work on this

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:15,240
project really had an issue with the

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,330
performance it just it just really never

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,760
felt you know really masonry the

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,730
JavaScript makes me plug into loading

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:28,830
images as you scroll down the page the

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:31,350
reality is that in 2015 then the main

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:39,210
part will be loaded opportunity images

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:45,620
into those cars in 2016 so we're talking

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:48,360
about really intense image uploading and

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,980
presentation this isn't an application

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,910
when people come back again and again

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:57,300
and images frankly probably not going to

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,460
look that these images multiple times we

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,790
become people look at it you better

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,590
bring on her god knows what computer

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,210
that she's got and you got your hands

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:12,360
and so the range of user

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:15,910
that was with large and we did have

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,340
because of the older people in our our

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,490
user group just don't have go skating

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,770
fast equipment so I'm going to talk

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,470
today about these few techniques that I

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:31,630
use to make this application actually

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:33,849
work domain sharding dynamic image

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,580
coding and then how we put it all

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:42,969
together in hot services it's a lot more

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:44,890
than just the s so domain sharding you

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,080
know this isn't technique that some

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:52,380
people are familiar with some people

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:56,529
consider to be old-school with ATT to is

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:59,800
it's not as effective but domain

00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:03,010
sharding is a situation where instead of

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,370
downloading all of your assets from one

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,920
minute you can't don't you can download

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,380
them from all domains because we're

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,770
hours to complete will give six

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:18,430
simultaneous connections and so if you

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:21,399
have four thousand images and you're

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:25,060
taking six images that is essentially

00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:28,480
the proper contact so this only shows

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,940
two into that time two and two to go to

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,940
the reality is for most modern browsers

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:41,709
is about statistics with domain sharding

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:45,339
what you do is use the C names to alias

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:47,950
okay because browsers don't care about

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:52,450
the IP address their home look fully

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:55,209
qualified domain name so sharp one dot H

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,029
and celebrations calm and sharp to die

00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:01,300
chance versus calm London I went back to

00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:03,670
the same folder I can serve images up so

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,310
instead of serving six at a time I can

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:10,040
serve multiple that

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:15,080
a lot of people say this is a little

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:19,190
school just an idea of this looks like

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:22,160
here are three of beginners lanes and a

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,649
highlighted blue the fact that they all

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,300
are enchanted celebrations but we use

00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:32,540
some some worse health brides that was

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,029
fun that hoops embrace extraordinary

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,940
some of the words that they use so that

00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,790
is essentially what a started a sharp

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,430
system looks like your ladies have

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,649
different subdomains they don't resolve

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,380
to the same location so they're all able

00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:52,910
to let me down from any one of these

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:56,300
domains the pros and cons of domain

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:59,260
sharding is number one in the cost

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,930
there's time required for the DNS looker

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:05,990
so there it's not a one-to-one

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:09,529
correspondence if I have two domains I

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:14,330
will get it twice as fast three times as

00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:19,990
fast is there that time require lookup

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:23,890
it does degraded HTTP two protocols

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,490
secure protocols they are replacing

00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,800
domain sharding

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,540
as a way to speed things up because they

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,920
don't make the connections in the same

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,070
way they don't have the same kind of

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,410
browser limitations and number three is

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:45,920
website modification so if you must use

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:49,190
this technique it still works I'll show

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,910
you something it this still works we saw

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,070
a 20% increase in page load of time with

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,279
charting the resources from our content

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:02,959
delivery network and for us for the

00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:05,000
Battle of small images disappears or not

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,190
everyone a large them if this aren't the

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,110
production images that you're going to

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:13,540
eventually buy or format we do get a

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,820
little bit

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:21,410
thousands of images to show on these

00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:24,650
pages and charting it's out there and it

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:28,970
still look like a good option so here's

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:31,550
an actual waterfall data from tests that

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,890
I did so I created a page that had a

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:38,330
thousand and ninety two images on them

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,610
and I looked at the water top and you

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:44,000
can see this wonderful this is them not

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:47,560
Charlotte example innocence downloading

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,970
all of these images you can see six six

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,980
six six six six you can really see that

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,440
simultaneous number of downloads the two

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,200
rabbits are proud of that is this not

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,970
the center you know to keep one domain

00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:09,410
from coming in and just you know not

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:12,200
rather when this is the test showing a

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,779
situation where we have three domain

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,990
shards and you can see in here that we

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:20,350
increase it is internet about us it's

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:24,080
about three percent

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,660
this is counted it up and it's almost

00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,490
exactly percentage-wise what we saw so

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,950
you really can see it right through the

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,670
hard call that this is this is actually

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,270
working

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:39,680
and I didn't run in the for test this is

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:43,040
a compilation of that beta and showing

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,980
some averages and with no sharp are that

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,490
was the 92 image page loaded up between

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,170
60 and 80 seconds so this is not this is

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,450
the motor instantly there's nothing

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,930
about business instant and people

00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:00,050
understand that we need to look at them

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,720
to donate is a little better we found

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:07,510
that for us three three domains to sharp

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,510
these images from three subdomains

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,279
it is our best performance typically

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:17,010
were under 20 seconds to load that paint

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,660
as you go up and try to apply with me

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,209
now you get into this situation where

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,490
the time it takes to look up the

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:27,029
Deanna's is degrading it and you're not

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,579
really bankers out there so the good

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,170
news was the Charlotte still works seems

00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:35,040
to work really well for this particular

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:38,940
application so great so we started up

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,100
something mean and declare victory and

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,170
then the photo editors started creating

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:50,760
the neck arms and our Motor Group is

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:55,440
contracted as well and I find that in my

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:58,790
job you really don't have a ton of the

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:03,300
rules on people creating content that's

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:08,940
like the tail wagging and in most cases

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:17,459
that doesn't work really well so let me

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:21,449
show you this code here so this is and

00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:24,120
I'm gonna page must be some code since

00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:28,589
it's just a really simple example of how

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:32,310
you sharp code and I'm showing over here

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:35,970
if I got a string that's just a variable

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:39,750
that contains that big long with all

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:43,620
these links I'm just doing this simple

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:47,310
explode explode that bomb through all

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,680
those links to www and then I'm going to

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:53,279
go back put that string back together

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,720
with my mom domain names and in this

00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:07,319
case it's three so I just go through and

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:10,380
iteratively go through those I give it

00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,810
fun colors and so I'm able to take my

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:16,319
content in charter so that's what we do

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:20,069
personally the content where do you put

00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:22,470
this in its best if you do this and you

00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:25,430
save your code you just don't want to

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:29,149
create multiple sub commanders

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:32,089
for captions so you all be clued

00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:34,460
Chartres and the time of the content is

00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:36,950
floating but if filter in and sharpen

00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:41,529
code right one of those page we've none

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:46,040
of the better sometimes

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:50,270
so looks great charted up this is what

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:55,010
the net current creation oh you had some

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:57,080
tax you got some custom few and then the

00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:01,190
old method was they actually to the

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:03,649
folder and split it up into this content

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:07,040
box that we created that content boxes

00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:09,339
top pigs bridegroom up to show you the

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,929
top I didn't even know anything do this

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:15,589
it should be a little folder on your

00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:21,740
website and grab this wire right up into

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:25,520
that content area great but you slide it

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:29,570
up and then you go get thousands of

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:34,790
inches and then we come back from your

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:37,970
coffee you see all these various then

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:41,720
you're in its printed out and find out

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:44,780
so although the frontier of being a

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,780
shaman pictures you know we're ready to

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,390
clear victory in the reality was they

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:56,780
could only create two of these cards of

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:59,210
it in these wedding seasons there so we

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,660
were the situation to simply could not

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:06,320
create these not running images through

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,050
the editor in this way so that brought

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,170
me to the second part of this which was

00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:16,100
instead of uploading the images that way

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:18,140
we're just going to create my style we

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,290
know that they need look like you know

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,270
where the pointed to instead of bringing

00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:27,950
them into that way we're just going to

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:31,400
go in and just generate the map I was

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,830
able to control how many images the

00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,730
photo

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:38,919
but I was able to get them to

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,990
sequentially number them and to give me

00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,240
the starting and the ending number for

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:47,710
each one of those sections so all the

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:52,179
Bright Futures 400 the groom pictures

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:55,600
for a won the 500 so I able to do that

00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:59,409
with photo editors to generate a fake a

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:04,570
folder with all the images sequentially

00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:06,899
ordered and then also each have a file

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,750
name that starts with four letters and

00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:14,019
then the acronym here is identify off

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:17,049
then an active so with very few pieces

00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:19,480
of information now when they go to

00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:22,240
disconnect card they put in their

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,360
contract and then come over here and put

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,460
me the two pieces of information that

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:31,179
identify where they sign up if you found

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,630
any a folder or a specifics about me and

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:37,210
then and into the total acronym for each

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:41,710
type of a wedding and then over here

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:45,190
they come into the start sections of

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:48,429
pictures so we went from taking and all

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,250
hours to be wanting that car to the

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:54,279
situation now we didn't actually put all

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,240
the information in upload the images and

00:19:54,279 --> 00:20:02,279
by the time they're done

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:05,470
he's ready to go so as you saw our

00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:09,460
strategy to upload those images through

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:12,429
the WordPress system was not because of

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,769
the saw the number of images the fact

00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:18,399
that it would completely bogged down on

00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:19,490
their interoffice internet system they

00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:24,370
actually had come

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:27,500
has now put in a bigger single-user

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:30,350
pipeline wire into their office try to

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,920
make that work at the end of the day the

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,809
crunching that WordPress does the number

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,240
of images generates in the background

00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:40,010
when you upload into through content

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,790
editor it's just too much for this

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:47,390
application so what I did was I went

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:50,330
over to Amazon servers and so we had

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:54,260
already used to offload plug-in to

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:57,260
ocular images and taking them up into s3

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,940
the way that works is you actually put

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,150
your image of things WordPress in the

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:04,130
normal way and then there is a script

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:07,100
that runs in the background with the

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,230
third carbon provides a plugin and they

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:13,520
actually move your images about being

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:15,740
sued in Islam they replace the links in

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,160
your media library and they make that

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:25,429
work so we had already moved into using

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:28,700
Amazon as the positive images and in

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:31,340
addition to that we when I created a

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:35,620
shark I'm not going to talk much too

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:38,420
much about a cloud is the the front for

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,990
showing your images that are responsible

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,170
for images in an apartment that button

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,300
actually hasn't URL address and then so

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:50,210
you can show your images directly from

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:54,080
the bucket through cloud upon with that

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:56,510
address but the third thing I want to

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,170
bring this is how could you land that

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:03,679
which is another cameras on service to

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:06,620
emulation Amazon lambda if you're not

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,990
familiar with it is a service kind of

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,940
like Heroku

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:13,429
which basically if you have cousin you

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,100
wanna run you don't have to have your

00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:19,190
own server you don't have to me edit any

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,520
of the backend to make that piece of

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,980
code run you can run my hand up it'll

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:30,169
bring up the research fee to run the

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:32,690
code and you're done and so I said how

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:33,350
are we going to replace the image

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,630
manipulate

00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,159
and that happens in WordPress and take

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,500
that off on you got some more outs

00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,029
before we look at the animals on land

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,600
that we looked at doing it on our own

00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:47,830
server we were on yes or in WordPress

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,380
engine down the problem with the VPS is

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:55,009
that there are too many people doing the

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:58,340
offload we couldn't go into all the

00:22:55,009 --> 00:23:02,000
different machines that were using some

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,889
images and get everything resolved and

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,960
set up so that everybody seen that we

00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:08,210
had was doing the image manipulation

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,149
because it were to the bottom image

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:14,000
magic presentation server they put a lot

00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:17,090
of different work but other ones get too

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,549
many machines and not enough people with

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:30,830
training to get that set up and running

00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:36,309
so I started one week old and you to

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:39,620
genre Steve's allow that there are image

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:44,200
conversion using Amazon lambda and s3

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:47,210
and OJ gas it was just and what John

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,370
describes is something that's not it's

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,460
not new there are other people describe

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:54,710
person pieces of this Amazon itself and

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:59,029
their web services even talks about how

00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:02,080
to do this but John provided me the

00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:06,200
starting point of the note doc take us

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:09,259
file that with do the instant version I

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:13,279
can take my images and upload with the

00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:16,090
large size and the nodejs script will

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,460
create a center up to misophonia

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:21,889
and it will also create a optimized

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:29,360
larger size image and you see when you

00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:32,809
click so a little bit about what it

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,179
looks like in Amazon can believe it so I

00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:37,370
had this script and I'll show you just a

00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:40,840
little bit of it the full script that

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm using is included in my cupcakes

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,990
that's prayed so I've uploaded the

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,460
script and then I said Anna Turner and

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,350
you can see over here the chicken and

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:56,810
lots of triggers and one of the triggers

00:24:51,350 --> 00:25:00,440
you can add something so I am situation

00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:03,020
now where whenever content is loaded

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:07,370
into the watching the bucket east

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:11,540
weddings this trigger immediately takes

00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:15,640
those images doesn't work thumbs up full

00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:21,440
sizes up put another bucket on Amazon

00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:24,260
that I saw people my photo editors can

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,900
now go man and distantly upload the

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:32,140
entire dinners folder and by the time

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:41,300
they get over to the page it's there so

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:49,520
hours and this is a lonely on that look

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:52,220
at that so just a little bit of what

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,380
this note that J's file is I've never

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,800
done even know if you love the

00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:01,790
JavaScript so it was pretty easy

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:07,010
the the first time that I have github

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:09,470
and all of the beat the body there's

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,300
lots of logging in a sprint to make sure

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,010
things did what they were supposed to do

00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:21,710
see the folder so it really went down

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:25,010
and I use that to know this is based on

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:28,010
tears over so with a lot of knows that

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,520
everything I was able to pretty really

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,140
get this working it uses image magic and

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:37,010
at the end of your code you just pulled

00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:40,760
in from those libraries I get the name

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:43,160
of the folder that was uploaded so that

00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,680
information eventually happen here and

00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,770
I'm not putting it in here it knows the

00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,440
folder

00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,530
it reads that acronym for each one of

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,990
the images and they go in and I said two

00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:59,340
different image of size M exercises with

00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:03,450
it it streams those are the minutes back

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:07,410
out to be an output bucket into two

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:17,070
folders the wedding comes way being

00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:21,059
large the final bit of this is to make

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:24,440
that bucket Amazon available on the

00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:27,510
internet with a web address in our case

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,730
this is where we did our schemes so I

00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:34,530
have to get over here grab a

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:38,360
distribution here that points to a

00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,360
bucket and weighed over on the right

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:53,309
that created a distribution and then I

00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:57,600
gave these awesome alternative names so

00:27:53,309 --> 00:28:00,750
you can all from Amazon right here set

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,630
it up for the email that you want to use

00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:06,240
it's looking at that output bucket right

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:11,570
there and then I won't show it but I

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,570
went over to my DNS and then I created

00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:21,900
so using three here of a blob of

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:25,760
services the lambda and the s3 and

00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:29,160
CloudFront we were able to to really

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,370
take the image manipulation completely

00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:36,270
out and yet I still will bring it back

00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:40,080
in and so that it really looks seamless

00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:48,059
there's no if you do know what we're

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:50,550
going on and ripping involve Angelini

00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,970
library on that page now holds it all

00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,970
happens

00:30:59,099 --> 00:32:26,259
we're very impressed by how hard you

00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:29,679
work and what you've achieved with very

00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:33,179
challenging this front you look they

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,669
were one kind of yours I wonder whether

00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:42,230
first of all where you like doing you

00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:44,960
know work with lots of

00:32:42,230 --> 00:34:25,490
optics photos whatever's and whether

00:32:44,960 --> 00:34:44,149
you've seen this opportunity to the

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:46,909
business with the quality you're going

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:50,059
to help documents Thanks

00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:51,109
they know that and so they help that

00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:54,010
they give you

00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:54,010
it's actually

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,280
[Music]

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:20,530
this is not a novel you know and they're

00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:35,600
not well because these are not

00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:39,050
production and then we're going to be

00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,090
resized for the web and then you know

00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,530
this is this kind of a guitar you know

00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,480
one of the first questions when we

00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:50,350
started this or presses the image

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,790
manipulator I need to give me some

00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:56,490
thumbnail I want to eat to become full

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:59,580
side and then thumb urgent and center

00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:02,730
and I'm sorry today that we've talked

00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,680
about it is to connect even the liberal

00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,380
photo editors and that's how if we did

00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,300
you know to go back to them and there's

00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,730
a lot of them is another and how many

00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,040
people are you're going to try to tell

00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:18,500
when you can be doing your dog this way

00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:21,600
and so finding the tool that will

00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:26,490
eliminate the need for them to do this

00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:29,450
and it's also not not that bad you know

00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:36,710
their process initiatives to get out

00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:48,360
mountains videos this is a side deal

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:52,340
marketing otherwise I really don't know

00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:56,640
what laughing Hooters decision more tabs

00:37:52,340 --> 00:38:09,210
or a lot of the panel that we have some

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:10,890
ability so long because originally it

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,930
was like well look everything's about

00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,510
two hundred you just have that would be

00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,640
fine so you know two weeks after we get

00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:22,590
the solution you know somebody's put

00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,990
four thousand and so you know which is

00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:29,400
that that's where it really just unless

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:30,930
we begin to try control what people is

00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,130
being made to make it easier for the

00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:38,910
dollar which really we need to find

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:46,740
solutions developers that make these or

00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:48,720
photo editors quick question so there's

00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,030
people come with their cameras and

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,240
doesn't that stuff you talk a little bit

00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:56,040
about you mentioned they have numbers of

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,470
rank like they tell if either the bride

00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,760
want to so are they pretty much

00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:05,400
organized

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:07,619
and then he goes in or like the first

00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,850
measure to keep my mistake so they get

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,660
all of those cool anything it's operated

00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,970
good

00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,570
is there a notification might your

00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:21,080
trigger there's something Romani that

00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:25,950
upload all their photos again are they

00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:36,180
do this all that one didn't well I guess

00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:40,430
there's something really really nothing

00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:43,820
bad really happens with it is not the

00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:47,869
everything they've got the wrong numbers

00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:51,240
then they just go back in originally

00:39:47,869 --> 00:40:05,630
hotter burgers and geographers we

00:39:51,240 --> 00:40:12,119
actually are using smart place that post

00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:22,640
post but image common storage and we

00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:25,260
have so what happens is is the garbage

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,540
chute way they help load their

00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,030
confidence modify and then the photo

00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:34,280
editors as the ready to work on each job

00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:40,140
they don't look too they're working

00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:45,300
stations job and in their job to loosen

00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:49,220
and select the ones that would be so

00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,220
that's that's a baby

00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:17,130
eating inside they were using their own

00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:30,329
server doing all this anoxic you can see

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:33,329
that that was something you had already

00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:37,470
actually other companies that do this

00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:40,200
and those companies wouldn't keep them

00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:45,260
up they're professional today we're

00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:48,510
working with third parties three days

00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:57,240
but in a fairly short time they were

00:41:48,510 --> 00:42:00,869
gone and so they want to sustain their

00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:04,950
there and then like I said we fuse down

00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:09,329
at the market to be able to show you

00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:16,319
know the bride's beautiful in your

00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:18,690
wedding it's all on the bed place are

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:28,289
catered for weddings so they have nice

00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:36,480
place that's really to go right in and

00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:39,170
they're not event in have had a daughter

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:45,170
of capital they're not in acting but

00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:45,170
something goes exactly

00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:51,890
[Music]

00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,890
you really does the trick

00:42:52,530 --> 00:43:03,450
