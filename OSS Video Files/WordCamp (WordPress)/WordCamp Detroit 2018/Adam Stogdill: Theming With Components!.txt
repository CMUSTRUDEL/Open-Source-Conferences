	I’d like to showcase some easy ways to organize theme development and set developers up to start thinking of things in components for React/Vue/Js.framework of the week or getting set up for Guttenberg’s latest/greatest.

00:00:42,609 --> 00:02:13,480
so some of these terms

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:51,720
so right now we're kind of slowly

00:02:17,730 --> 00:03:10,530
Panama's angular angular is awesome so

00:02:51,720 --> 00:03:24,199
react so yeah this is the turn to code

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:24,199
and the way that you do so let's type in

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:37,760
so this is the website but let's take a

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,760
look at it

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,750
so you've got a love of humanity like

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:49,819
the navigation on over there set of sub

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:55,220
navigation can be composed a little bit

00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:55,220
to make things more fun we can also put

00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:09,650
this is just trying to drive home

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,740
[Music]

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:12,680
it's okay so here's a little brand of my

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,640
page

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:34,430
probably never seen this between how we

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:37,700
would do it olden days whatever whatever

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:47,660
posing instead is wrestling component

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:50,690
and so the top here you can see that

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:56,450
with even s composable pieces why would

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:58,760
I need up so I've got a block but I can

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,040
also just use my pocket here in between

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,430
so you've got like these composable

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,430
Liggett

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,370
[Music]

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:41,270
you know it's fine oh just a plastic and

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:53,540
then it's super awesome that's what we

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:55,880
do so anyway it is little pieces on

00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:01,030
think right the Legos are a nice little

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:04,880
pocket that's organized so here's a

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:07,370
navigation on our folders with their own

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,940
template piece and their own stock sheet

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:18,320
he headed home counseling you can have a

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:26,260
lock and such as PHP though both

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:28,380
sometimes you begin okay easy here at

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,710
those files

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,120
they're all packaged up awesome India

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,860
one of them to know if the Navy

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,380
commissioned our table here it's

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,590
whatever the folders is also the pilots

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,400
except for the different type inside of

00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,470
those files

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,340
Brian capsulate that code in the

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,720
container amazing same name

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,220
therefore when I'm on the front end of

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,770
the website I'm gonna make its test

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,770
bigger I can just inspect it find out

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,960
we'll see you all closed for pictures

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,930
and then another thing why you should do

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,340
this in addition to just learning this

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:17,400
is a new developer all right explain

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:21,030
this one time hey it's Ted blocks all

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,250
the labels label you just tell me pick

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:27,420
it okay fine choose your style right

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:40,590
there it's the fashion style t craters

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:42,360
on the transcript all this time today is

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,660
the future time

00:09:42,360 --> 00:10:19,110
so in this form ocular building possible

00:09:45,660 --> 00:10:22,860
way awesome project so this is a lot

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:32,150
intent but this has been to in the

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:35,900
WordPress itself apart so lots better

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,900

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,050
contained completely I think we should

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:38,370
try and strive for this way maybe got

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,339

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,410
concern this is where

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:10,670
