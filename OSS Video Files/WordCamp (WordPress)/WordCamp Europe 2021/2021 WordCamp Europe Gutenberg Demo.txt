Welcome to this Gutenberg highlight

00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:11,081
as the block editor gets ready to become a site builder.

00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:15,937
Introduced last year, patterns are a major component of the Gutenberg roadmap.

00:00:15,937 --> 00:00:18,990
They can be as simple as single blocks or

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,630
as complex as a full-page layout.

00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:29,492
The Selection tool is optimized for navigating through the block structure.

00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:34,694
It shows the name, icon, and outlines of the block as you hover and move around.

00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:39,418
An improvement worth highlighting is when a block is nested

00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:43,532
its parent container will always show up to the left of the toolbar.

00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:48,188
This outline is also present for parent blocks, making it easier to reason

00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:52,364
what the block boundaries are, and allowing changes you want to do.

00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:56,518
Several improvements have been made to drag interactions across the board

00:00:56,518 --> 00:01:00,990
which includes dragging media inside any container blocks or patterns.

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,496
And speaking of design tools, inline cropping is a major feature

00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:10,290
that allows quick customizations without leaving the editor canvas.

00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:16,150
We're constantly exploring ways to surface relevant block transformations.

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,500
Two quick examples are adding an overlay text

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,720
to an image block, which transforms the image block into a cover and

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,270
adding padding controls that show these overlaid bars

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,770
as you interact with the control.

00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,450
There are multiple ways to move blocks around.

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,983
A great feature is the ability to copy or cut an entire block

00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,047
to paste it somewhere else.

00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:47,040
It's as simple as focusing a block and pressing Command X.

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,371
The Selection Tool highlighted earlier incorporates drag and drop as well.

00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:56,115
And there are more improvements planned for these features.

00:01:56,115 --> 00:02:04,020
The inserter panel now also supports drag and drop to insert blocks and patterns in specific places.

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,780
Let's now get into transforms.

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,830
Transforms are so important that we have incorporated live previews

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,950
for every transform target, so you can check what

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,169
each one does before changing your content.

00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:24,040
They also work with multi-block selection, and are contextual

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,499
to what are the most relevant targets for the blocks.

00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:30,516
You can convert a group of blocks into columns

00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,980
or, if the text is short enough, into a row of buttons.

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,000
It works just as well with other block types

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,881
like images to make a gallery or slideshow.

00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:44,513
An upcoming update will integrate patterns with block creation and transforms,

00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:48,151
allowing you to choose a specific pattern as a starting point

00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:51,280
for a specific block directly in the canvas.

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,220
One of our major focuses is expanding the set of design tools to be able to

00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,839
power all the things we want to do with themes and patterns.

00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,499
Let's now take a look at the cover block.

00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:08,540
It is now possible to drag an image to set it as the background directly.

00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:13,740
It's also possible to drag an image and set it as a child block

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,582
so you can get some cool effects by manipulating focus, overlay gradient, and padding.

00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,305
It's several tools coming together.

00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,223
The results can also be packaged as a pattern,

00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:30,778
so they are one click away from being widely accessible.

00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:36,060
This was just a glimpse of what's going on into the block editor.

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,520
Let's now take a look at what's next.

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,036
One feature we're looking forward to are duotone image filters.

00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:48,720
If you imagine a grayscale image where the shades of gray

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,420
are replaced with a color gradient of your choice, that's duotone.

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,954
The navigation block is becoming more and more robust with more options

00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:01,990
and child blocks to choose from.

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,130
Its list view allows seeing the menu structure from a different perspective

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,160
useful for handling multiple nested sub-menus.

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,076
More customization options are available to entirely change

00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:20,460
how the navigation looks.

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,990
Features like automatic collapse into an icon menu with an overlay on smaller viewports.

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,819
Changing the template of a page or post is

00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,780
also going to be deeply integrated with the editor.

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,590
The full site editor is also helping improve the list view browser

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,140
to get a better sense of how blocks are laid out on a page.

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,670
When selecting a parent group or template part,

00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:57,340
you can also get an easier overview of all its children.

00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,360
And last but not least

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,180
a new global styles design is also coming.

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,060
It streamlines changing how elements and blocks look across the site.

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,530
These improvements are crucial as the block editor gets ready

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,043
to become a site builder.

00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:16,120
