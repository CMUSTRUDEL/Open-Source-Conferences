good evening so I was just finding a

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,880
reason why you know you should become an

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,220
agency owner and not you know remain

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,890
freelancer because if you become an

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,790
agency owner then probably you can give

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,230
iPhone as an giveaway right and I was

00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,330
also finding a reason why you should

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,860
keep attending the work and because that

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,690
is the only day where you find that I

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:40,249
porn is the only cheapest product in the

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:44,039
market right so having said that I

00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:45,510
decided this topic about doing why to

00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,030
take the session on this topic is

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,420
because last year when we sponsored work

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,999
camp and I got a chance to interact with

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,059
a lot of developers and freelancers who

00:00:53,999 --> 00:01:00,089
are doing that full-time and I found

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,010
that there is a lot of potential within

00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:04,979
them that but there is something that is

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,750
you know stopping them doing and growing

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,000
from where they are or they might have

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,939
stuck somewhere and they are looking for

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,500
some inputs so they were asking some

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,200
random questions and I thought that why

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,270
not to you know take a session on it and

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,460
probably do it so I thank you the work

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,490
camp and our team who has actually

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,140
accepted this topic and allow me an

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,439
opportunity to you know speak in front

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,649
of you and sharing my experience of last

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,329
17 years which have been you know acting

00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:38,329
as an business owner

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,350
so before I start with this this is just

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:02,470
a little bit about me I am a founder and

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,840
CEO of company called Z less Webb and I

00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,600
have around like 17 years of experience

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,009
in the web mobile application

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,090
development and digital marketing

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:15,220
services earlier this year I was lucky

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,070
enough to you know attend to work camp

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,420
in u.s. one was in New York another one

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:24,250
is in LA and fortunately I got a chance

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,280
to speak for maybe around five minutes

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,250
on the concept called Marc camp where

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,470
you have to submit your topic and if you

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,780
get a maximum vote then probably you are

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,350
allowed to speak on it and it was a

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,910
great experience and apart from this as

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:44,230
far as my educational background is

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:46,690
concerned I am a science graduate having

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,940
a major in chemistry which was actually

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,209
not by my choice but by force because I

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,980
really didn't get a good marks in my

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,680
board exams so that is the only option

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,500
that I had and then eventually I found

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,799
that I am more into the computers and I

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,650
did a full time course for the six month

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,780
in Syria chem Java which was primarily

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,380
run by the company called gateway

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,209
technology for 15 years and after doing

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,400
in computers I worked for a company for

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,950
around one and half year and I

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,440
eventually found that I am good at and

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:23,350
all I like more of an people management

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,830
rather than doing a programming myself

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,470
so I decided to start my own agency I

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,260
work as an independent freelancer for

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,630
six month and then eventually I found a

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,860
need to build an agency and then I

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,840
started apart from this I also did my

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,850
post graduation diploma from near my

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,910
University into an Internet service Ness

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,739
and as far as my personal life is

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,019
concerned I am the youngest child

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,540
although I do not look like young but I

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:55,060
am the youngest one and I have one

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,860
beautiful wife wifes are always

00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,860
beautiful that is being told and

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,959
sometimes the husbands are also handsome

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,280
as well but

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,709
apart from this I have two kids who

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,260
keeps me busy with their Avengers and

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,629
want me to be a one of the character in

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,829
daily and they keep on changing Baghdad

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:22,830
I like sports even though I am wearing

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,560
the Matt's t-shirt I am NOT a baseball

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,290
fan but I play a cricket like a baseball

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,960
so I just put that I chose to you know

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,900
select that particular photo for this

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,699
presentation and I'm a wicket keeper and

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,910
part-time batsman

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:43,500
what I'm Paula is well moving to the

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:46,440
next slide there are few assumptions

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,120
that I have taken into while making this

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,300
presentation so make sure that you get

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,550
the maximum value out of this and the

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,410
first one is that I I hope that you are

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,270
into the industry you are not just a

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,449
trainee or maybe is passed out from the

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,060
college and you have maybe one or two

00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:05,669
years of experience working either as a

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,490
designer or a developer or a queue as

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,800
well the second one is that you have

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,750
burning desire to do something on a

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,849
larger scale so if you are happy with

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,889
whatever you are doing right now and you

00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:19,139
don't want to take any extra burden or

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,810
you don't have any goals to grow larger

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,660
probably this session would not interest

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,970
you but I understand because you are

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,580
here you have interest to grow your

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,710
company or maybe you know whether you

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,349
are working as an senior people in your

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,660
organization or your freelancer or you

00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:39,120
are a small agency you wanted to grow

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,520
from where you are the third assumption

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,500
is that you like to work as a team

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,650
player because when you think about

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,389
growing an agency I have talked with

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,580
many freelancer and I asked them why you

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,490
keep on doing this and they say that I I

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,550
like to work alone and I don't get gel

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,139
well with the team so probably there is

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,000
another reason that I would say that I

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,289
assume that you like to work within the

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,810
team as well you have a good business

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,639
ethics right now and you are going to

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,280
keep the good business ethics in the

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,879
future as well that is another

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,590
assumptions that I have made and you

00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,750
wanted to grow with WordPress community

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,610
that is another because we are all about

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,620
talking about the WordPress and I think

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,419
that is the e we all know what press

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,650
that either from the front-end

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,259
perspective or from the backend

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,889
perspective so we wanted to all build

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,710
our agency around WordPress and also

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,960
give back to the community when you get

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,159
a success in your life right so these

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,469
are the assumptions that I have made

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:45,840
next so who is going to be benefited

00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:50,069
from this particular presentation that I

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,319
am making first and foremost is the

00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,840
full-time or part-time freelancers I

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,180
think we are going to enjoy this session

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,150
a lot because I have tried to cover a

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,729
lot of things which is related to their

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,550
future the second people is the small

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:07,409
startup agencies who are no longer a

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,710
freelancer they might have started their

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:13,020
own company and they have two three five

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,849
people working for them but they wanted

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,699
to scale from where they are right now

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:20,219
and the third people is the employee in

00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,139
the readership role because we have

00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:24,479
heard from the lot of speakers that they

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,219
are already retired and they are retired

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,650
means their companies are still running

00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:31,349
but that is because of the CEO and the

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,389
CEO in their companies which means that

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:35,610
if you are today a project manager or a

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,520
project leader or a team leader probably

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,680
tomorrow if your company owner decide to

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,659
no get the retirement at the lead life

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,580
you are going to be responsible for

00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,729
making all of this decision which I am

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,800
going to present so probably if you are

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:53,069
not a freelancer and if you are working

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,199
for an agency and at the senior position

00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,159
then probably this presentation would

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,770
interest you as well so I pretty much

00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,689
can I ask question how many of us are

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:12,120
working for an agency as an leadership

00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:13,860
role and not a freelancer good right so

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,400
I would like to start this presentation

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:20,190
with the code that says that there are

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,409
two great days in a person's life one

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,670
when we are born and another when we

00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:26,490
discover why we are do

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,950
anything why we are here today to attend

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,600
the work camp or maybe a question that

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,550
comes that why tomorrow morning at

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,610
around 9:00 a.m. you are going to join

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,260
your company or maybe if you leave your

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,630
company around 7:00 p.m. in the evening

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,240
why you are going at home if we can

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,490
answer all of these questions probably

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,220
we would be in better position to decide

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,610
what we wanted to do right so moving to

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,970
that I think I have few Y's that would

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:57,090
clear us that whether we should why you

00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:02,460
should go for an agency ownership rather

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:05,370
than doing in full-time freelancing so

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,970
there are eight reasons out of these the

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:13,890
first one is the heavy workload how many

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:18,570
of us has you know found ourself going

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:20,760
on a vacation with the laptop and you

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,740
know working maybe one or two hours when

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,660
you are you know on a vacation you are

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,910
not supposed to be working but you are

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,180
answering your clients email being

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,520
influencer can you raise your hands is

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,400
it very common yeah okay let's forget

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,350
about laptop how many of us as maybe you

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,000
are on an international trip on a

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,190
vacation and you have an international

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,960
roaming on just because you don't want

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,390
to connect with your family members like

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,890
parents you wanted to call them but you

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,900
wanted to check your emails in their

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,340
mobile devices because you want to make

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,370
sure that you are not losing any money

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,440
right so these are the situations where

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,050
you find that you have an heavy workload

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,220
and you should think about you know when

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,620
you are on vacation you are actually

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,660
enjoying your vacation and somebody else

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,050
can take care of certain tasks that

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,240
keeps your clients on as well the second

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,300
is that financial business isn't scaling

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,190
which means that at one person you are

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,890
really good plug-in developers but you

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,740
can develop maybe one plug-in in three

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,990
months time or maybe a two plug-in in

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,550
sixth or nine months time and also you

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,350
can't build anymore because the two

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,690
plugins that you have built you have to

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,940
provide the support as well so your

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,310
freelance business is not scaling and

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,900
you wanted to skill it then that is

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,700
another reason why you should go for an

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,610
agency ownership rather than bring

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,940
freelancing

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,320
the third one you are already

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,870
collaborating with other freelancers

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,209
this is what I have heard because I ask

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,700
questions that you are a developer and

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,080
you are working as a freelancer what do

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,610
you do for your designing and they say

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,800
that we work with another fill answer

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,200
who is in freelance web designer and

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,240
they give us and part-time support now

00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,519
if you are doing this very aggressively

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,010
and not occasionally which means that

00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,649
you are risking yourself because the

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,329
ability of the freelancers are not if

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,459
they are not full-time then it sits

00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:13,050
under digital probably that is another

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,810
reason that rather than relying on

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,459
somebody for a longer period short term

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,170
period it's fine but for the longer

00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,720
period it would good to employ somebody

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,089
so that probably you haven't know you

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,870
can be having an accountability and you

00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:29,550
can answer to your clients as well the

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,120
fourth one is that your ability is about

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,940
to change

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,620
let's say you got married maybe two

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,120
three years and you are going expecting

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,100
a baby and probably you are thinking

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,600
that now you are not able to give maybe

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,260
the same amount of time that you are

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,110
giving to your business being in you

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,700
know bachelor or being and you know a

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,140
non-parent but now your ability is going

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,839
to change that is another way of

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,300
thinking that now your personal time is

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,829
going to be splitted and you should have

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,959
an extra hand then that is another

00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:02,880
reason why you should you know think

00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,829
about this you can't plan once more

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,050
everybody here thinks that we are the

00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:09,089
best freelancer in the world which also

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,100
your client thinks as well and they want

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,839
you to work on multiple projects but

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,790
because you don't finish your first

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,070
project you can't move to the second or

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,570
even if you are a really good juggler

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,820
then probably you can work on two but

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,520
not on three or four or five projects so

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,110
if your client needs more from you that

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,270
is another reason why you should also

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,870
think that it is a time to you know

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:32,579
build your own agency you are a good

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,040
team you are a good at a team management

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:37,980
that is an essential part of you know

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,230
owning any agency that you have to be

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,519
really good team management otherwise

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,589
what will happen that you will hire

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,560
somebody if you are not able to manage

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:46,990
them they will leave

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,060
and you will keep yourself finding busy

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,770
hiring more and more people so that is

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,540
another important aspect that you have

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,880
to be a good player so if you think that

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,520
you are a good team manager then

00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,760
probably there is nobody to you know

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,260
start your own agency you allow the

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,800
business development most of the time

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,110
you will find that the owners life at

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,420
the end maybe after five years or six

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,670
years they find themselves more involved

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,830
into the business development and if you

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:18,279
think that you love this activity then

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:22,180
probably you are also eligible for you

00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:25,029
know owning a company as well and last

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,440
but not the least to work with an

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,150
established engine see this is one of

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,330
the one of the point that would probably

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,320
interest some of the CEO or the agency

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,290
owners as well

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,960
because I have been you know agency

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:41,230
owner for 15 years now we get a lot of

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,760
work requests we many times tell no to

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,890
the client because we don't know any

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,589
small agencies that we can sub outsource

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:50,770
those projects to and if you are at

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,000
Finland cell probably because it's not

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,470
because of the capability of the

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,420
freelancers but sometime it's the

00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,030
turnaround time that we expect on a

00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,980
project probably only a small wave

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,690
agency could help us so if you build

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,790
your own agency from the freelancing

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,820
probably you get a chance to work with

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:09,490
many larger companies that is around you

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,990
as well so that is an entry point for

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,270
you as that that you can say that now I

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,339
am in small wave agency owner rather

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,740
than a freelancer and probably the

00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,690
companies would work with you and give

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,510
you an you organs and subcontractor for

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:27,420
them as well so these are the reasons

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,420
why you should start your own agency

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,390
so before we conclude whether you should

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:37,330
wanted to go for it or not there are

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,070
some pros and cons of starting your own

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:43,150
agencies and I would like to go through

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,550
that as well so you have a team you

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,170
can't suck if you don't have a team if

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,570
you're a team do you can support and

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,070
maintain your client as well so which

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,320
means that you have five different

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:56,110
products or maybe 15 different projects

00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,640
running and if client after the projects

00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,960
or product delivered probably you have

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,480
to

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,950
the support to the client I think if you

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,920
have a team then probably you can put

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:07,590
somebody to you know finish the task so

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,830
that allows you as an agency owner to

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,690
you know support multiple clients you

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,230
can delegate the work that you do the

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,820
best

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:21,540
which means minimizing your weaknesses

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,670
which me the the being is that if you

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,740
are you as an individual cannot do

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,970
everything whatever even though your

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,280
requirement is that you have to do

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,230
everything designing development QA and

00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,430
deployment everything it doesn't mean

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,120
that you are good at everything

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:38,370
if you hire somebody if you become an

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,840
agency owner you only do what you are

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:44,160
good at and other things you can always

00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:46,620
delegate to somebody else and focus on

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,970
what you do the base so you play against

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,830
your friend a lot of times you have a

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,620
strained your skills but you are not

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,540
actually able to utilize that because

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,570
you find yourself busy with the other

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,970
tasks so in case you haven't multiple

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,890
team members that supports you probably

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,570
you will be able to focus on something

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,040
which you are good at and when you are

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,200
doing something which you are good at

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:13,260
probably the success ratio is very

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:16,830
higher so there are pitfalls of owning

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:20,340
an agency as well that you have to keep

00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:22,110
on recruiting people as and when project

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,700
requires somebody you know leaves your

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,350
company so you have to spend extra time

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,260
reaches and freelancer you are not

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,180
worried about because you don't have to

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,140
look for anybody else everything that

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:36,810
you are doing yourself trusting other

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,020
with the work you do is very hard a lot

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,690
of people will keep on saying that I am

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,570
doing freelancing for five years now

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,300
because the level of quality of work

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:51,180
that I can deliver to my clients nobody

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,610
else can do it but if that is the case

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,320
then there is a node like thousands and

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,820
hundreds of freelancers out there or

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,760
maybe wave agencies out there to serve

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,790
the clients so it's it's more of an like

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,709
you have to find the right people and

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,709
write potential and you can always train

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,300
them if you need to learn how to train

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,970
them you can probably go ahead and do it

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,980
but that's not the right

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,319
excus according to my experience that

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,539
nobody else can do the similar work like

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,159
I can do and sometimes I have found

00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:25,010
myself that I hadn't this assumption or

00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:27,709
this this philosophy when I was like two

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,230
or three years of you know running my

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:32,419
agency that I can do things are made and

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,980
I hire hire people and I actually found

00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,809
that they are doing it better than what

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,940
I was doing so if I would have taken

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:41,120
those decisions earlier probably I would

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,760
have grown much more time like bigger

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,799
than what we had in like two or three

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,809
years of life my agency life

00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,280
so sometimes it's reverse as well that

00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:53,059
somebody else can do better than what

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,809
you are doing if you run an agency you

00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:58,370
never actually do the work you enjoy now

00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:00,289
few people were you know asking me

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,090
because somebody who might have come a

00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,120
lead in this morning like around 8:00

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:08,270
a.m. I was just trying to stick the

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,820
stickers in our booth and as an agency

00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,679
owner you probably am not supposed to do

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,340
that but I love doing it because there

00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,380
was nobody

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,070
somebody was needing an assistance there

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,100
so there is no fixed job profile for an

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:24,650
wave agency owner and you should have no

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,120
shame on doing anything that is required

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,130
and that needs to be fixed this is a

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,260
thumb rule for owning any agency and you

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,120
might have found maybe if you are

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,520
working for a company or project

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,929
managers or maybe your directors might

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,179
be doing something which they are not

00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,549
supposed to do but they do it because it

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,309
required and they love doing it right so

00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:45,200
that is another drawback of if you think

00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:47,090
that you wanted to do only few certain

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,159
things then you have to be proof of that

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:54,350
and the last is that a team means people

00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,630
and people means responsibility as

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,390
influencer you are just responsible for

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,640
feeding your own family if you extend it

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,130
you might be enough filling maybe your

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,230
elders who might need your financial

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,330
support as well but when you are owning

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,150
an agency you are no longer responsible

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,250
for your family or extended family you

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,950
are responsible for each and every

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,049
employee that you hire because every

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,140
month the bear the check that you pay

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:23,840
that also halves that particular family

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,559
as well so you have to think from that

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,090
to spare

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,749
that you are adding this additional

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:35,570
burden that you will be responsible now

00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:37,970
for helping others as well so I think

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:43,340
these are the pros and cons that I can

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:44,629
think of and now I believe that if we

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,279
are still here and we are still here

00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:49,820
interested to listen further so I

00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,470
understand that we are now wanting to

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,659
you know build an agency not tomorrow

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,570
but maybe six-month or maybe one year or

00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,980
two years down the line so if we are

00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,899
building it what I am trying to do is

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,960
that instead of making this a flat

00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:05,090
slides I have tried to build a little

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,610
bit story so there will be a different

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,769
stages of an agency life that I have

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,509
tried to cover here and we will be

00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:13,399
looking at those points from those

00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:14,299
stages that we have experienced in the

00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:23,869
last 15 years

00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:26,179
so those stages are so there is a hand

00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:29,600
behind this it's lighter version so you

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:32,299
can see it but there is a legal aspect

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,590
that you have to look after there will

00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:35,450
be on stage where you have to think

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,679
about whether you need an co-founder or

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:41,539
not then you need an office space then

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,799
what should be your first hire and what

00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:45,080
are the things that you need to consider

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,289
if I that then what are the things that

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,389
you should celebrate as an agency and

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:53,090
then infrastructure human resource sales

00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:55,279
and system processes and there is a last

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,070
one going global so these are the

00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:03,009
different points that we will be looking

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,009
at and let's look at them one by one

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:10,789
okay so to start with I think the first

00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:13,789
the various legal aspect that we should

00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:15,529
be looking at and the first is that the

00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:18,919
agency name now I have a recommendation

00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:21,200
that people I see that people keep the

00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:24,139
agency in MV hu which are very fancy one

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,669
which has no meaning and if we ask them

00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:27,679
what is the meaning about this company

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:29,840
and they don't know about it what I try

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,789
to pass here is that whenever somebody

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,519
five years ten years down the line will

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:35,710
be asking you why you named the company

00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,679
like this you should have

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,870
vision attached to it so whatever name

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,700
you keep it but you make sure that

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,250
whatever culture you want to build for

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,309
in the company you try and attach that

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,320
with the brand name as well the next

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:52,570
point is the legal aspect what kind of

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,130
company that you wanted to build there

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,440
are two different kind of I am NOT going

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,510
to touch in detail about this because I

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,149
personally believe that you should hire

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,950
a CA who isn't better person who can

00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:05,740
give you a right suggestion which would

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,149
save a lot of tax and you know save you

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,159
from the lot of headache from the

00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:11,470
government agencies and kind of things

00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,380
so I'm just giving you an overview that

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,510
there isn't limited liability companies

00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,059
and unlimited liability companies that

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,340
you can build in the limited liability

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,779
companies unlimited liability companies

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,390
there is a proprietary ship firm which

00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:28,510
is the easiest one and there is another

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:31,210
thing is the partnership firm where

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,830
maybe one or two people minimum two

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,350
people are required so there is an

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,990
unlimited liability companies and in the

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:40,870
limited liability you have a private

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,510
limited the limited liability

00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:46,360
partnership firm which is called LLP and

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,789
there is one more company that is

00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,880
started like the the hill root out the

00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:54,940
rule is out there in since 2013 that you

00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,909
can build one person company as well so

00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:00,490
one person company is similar to the

00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:02,320
Private Limited firm but there is only

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,360
one person or one director required

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,590
there there is no other required the

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:11,860
only limitation with the one person per

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:14,770
company is that it should not cross the

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,080
turnover more than two crores rupees

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,149
so you can discuss this all details with

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,679
your CA and all but there are various

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,360
kind of companies that you can form that

00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,240
the easiest one year that didn't start

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,980
with would require a less documentation

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,700
and would allow you to focus on your

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,440
business the next point is the

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,020
co-founder selection this is very much

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,450
important because lot of people thinks

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,279
that right now I have skills to handle

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,950
everything and probably being an owner

00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,340
of five ten or fifteen people you can do

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:48,790
it all alone but when you grow when you

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:52,930
have a 50 60 or 100 or 500 people

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:55,630
you need other people to help you so try

00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:58,540
and make sure that you if you have a

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,690
long-term vision you try and say go for

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,580
and co-founder as well who is heavily

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,100
interested and having similar wavelength

00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,870
that you have so there are various

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,160
things that you should consider while

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:15,520
selecting the co-founder and the first

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,460
one is that you make sure that you are

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,950
not trying to replicate the strengths

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,470
you have if you are a really good

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,020
developer it is not a wise decision to

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,430
partner with somebody who is good at

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,080
development because you are already good

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,860
at development you can take care of

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,110
those things

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,030
it's matter that you complement each

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,440
other so go for in designer or somebody

00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,390
who is from the non-technical background

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,760
from the sales and marketing or kind of

00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,550
thing so that would probably help you

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,680
taking care of certain other departments

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:51,060
which actually requires your attentions

00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:55,780
as well next so next is the office space

00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:58,540
think about the office like you know you

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,390
are a start-up you don't know how much

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,280
you are going to grow go for an easier

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,530
option that isn't leasing an office

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,900
because and go for maybe 5 10 15 people

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:11,110
office space rather than investing more

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,090
into it make sure that you find a

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,580
location which is easy for your

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,890
employees because even if you have to

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,140
travel maybe five extra miles that's

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,700
fine but if your employees can probably

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,740
reach and have an access to the public

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,080
transport and everything which I found

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,450
that add the constraint when you are

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,020
hiring a people probably you should be

00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:36,150
thinking about those aspects as well and

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:38,860
apart from these you also look at the

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,360
multiple isp options as well because we

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,860
are into the internet business we have

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,710
to make sure that we are not just stuck

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,870
with one isp but we haven't multiple isp

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:50,050
options so that we always you and

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:53,470
haven't backup options for the internet

00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:55,450
connections as well next point is around

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:58,510
six to twelve month of your agency life

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,310
and that is the first hire that you and

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,200
that is the most crucial according to me

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,490
because they are going to reproduce

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,670
in the culture that you are trying to

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:10,330
build and that first hire that you make

00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:12,910
make sure that you don't go for an

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,670
experience but go for it potential in

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,950
the person which means the easiest thing

00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,230
in this world is to you know train

00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,580
somebody on the technology side if you

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,860
don't know something you are going to

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,020
google it and fix the problem if there

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,640
are number of videos available that you

00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,970
can learn from there are number of

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,460
professionals who provides the training

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:36,310
nobody provides the potentiality right

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,160
if person hasn't potential you can train

00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,590
them so always whenever we were hire and

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,470
specifically the first tile must have a

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:46,900
potential to grow with your agency or

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:50,790
your vision right so make sure you do

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,770
that apart and another thing which is

00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:56,140
always interview with your co-founder or

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,180
maybe somebody other than you who is a

00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,310
having an equal eligibility to do

00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,840
interview somebody because you don't

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,790
want to you know interview from a one

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,670
perspective always ask somebody else

00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:08,020
what do you think about him let them ask

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,550
the questions from the other end and

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,340
haven't discussed it and then do the

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:18,430
first tile it's not something that you

00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:19,780
should know neglect but from this a lot

00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,460
of people a lot of companies do

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,110
celebrate a lot of things there are

00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,020
minimum things that you need to you know

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:29,100
do is that everything that you do first

00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:32,110
has to be celebrated which means that

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,450
your first hire is completed maybe a

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,310
first month in your company and you have

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,440
to celebrate that with you I don't know

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,450
what scale you are celebrating it but

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,730
you have to celebrate it the reason why

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,980
we always found that anything that we

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,830
achieve for the first time if we

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,540
celebrate it probably it gives us a lot

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:51,220
of confidence for and we are doing

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,130
something else for the first time

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:57,490
because we have in history that we have

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,290
achieved this in past so always always

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,850
celebrate the day I'm not talking about

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,950
the first anniversary which is very

00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,260
common I'm talking about every minor

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,060
thing that happens in your company for

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:12,520
the first time try to celebrate that as

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:14,530
well okay apart from that then I

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,760
actually haven't red light so I need to

00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,640
you know speed up the

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,710
session so I will go faster though then

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,890
it comes to like one or two years when

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,910
you are already like 20 or 50 people

00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,770
then you have to go and buy another

00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,690
office your choice whether you wanted to

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,420
rent it or whether you even Dooley's it

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,900
make sure that you spend little amount

00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,790
of money into the infrastructure side

00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,520
but make sure that you have a really

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,930
good security and data protection this

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,540
is the stage where you will be working

00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:45,880
on multiple projects if you ignore this

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,500
fact you may end up you know losing the

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,520
clients or maybe losing your data and

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,280
everything so make sure you have a

00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,650
security in place and really good backup

00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,080
options apart from these this is the

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:59,050
time that the human resource department

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,630
that is very crucial because you will

00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,400
need to hire more and more people you

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:05,410
will find yourself busy

00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,420
in other tasks you need an Department

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,450
who will be in bridge between the team

00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,910
as well as the owner I that that is the

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,910
single-most department in the IT field

00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:17,740
because we all are that the resources

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,780
are the assets for the company and if

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,610
there is no good HR department in place

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,750
probably there will be a problems with

00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:27,550
the trainings and everything and then go

00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,590
to the sales and marketing part how to

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,420
you know scale your company there are

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,310
various things one of the single most

00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,620
important than the modes most modern

00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:37,810
thing is that the content marketing so I

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,210
give you a couple of example like an SEO

00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,010
Mo's who has you know read the content

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,570
marketing for the three years of you

00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,580
know their initial company and then they

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,350
built the loyal audience around them and

00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,730
then probably you know everybody was

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,890
following those articles and everything

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,290
and they change the brand name with the

00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,630
product that they launched and then they

00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,280
have those loyal customers who has

00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,620
actually purchased those products so

00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,720
doing and content marketing around the

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,880
services and the product and plugins is

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,310
the way to you know grow yourselves as

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,010
well apart from this I think you need to

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,840
hire the sales team this is the time

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:13,530
where you have to hire maybe multiple of

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,570
people who can probably help each other

00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:18,190
compete each other and probably bring

00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:22,450
more and more leads for your

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:24,490
organization as well then it will be a

00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,340
stage where you need a systems and the

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,350
processes in place as an agency and and

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,590
then ages

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,330
you have to have those minimum five

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,789
different things which is related to the

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:38,490
CRM or maybe your building or project

00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:40,679
management or maybe customer support all

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,260
of this system needs to be there and you

00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,330
need an SOP for each and every

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,549
department you have in your company

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:52,020
whether it's a designing sales marketing

00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:54,539
QA you need your SOPs in place as well

00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,510
so having 6th ed I think I have lost

00:30:54,539 --> 00:31:00,809
five different questions that I will

00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:02,880
quickly answer how do we successful

00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:06,840
while living agency life there is no

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,390
shortcut you have to have put a lot of

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,179
amount of effort time in the initial

00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,429
stage the next one how to decide what is

00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,799
ethical and not you are the your own

00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:18,360
boss you have to decide what is ethical

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,230
and you have to keep make sure that you

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,669
pass this message in the agency as well

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:26,100
how do I change my persona for the

00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:29,340
agency's growth if you find as an owner

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:31,350
some negative or weaknesses in yourself

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,630
probably you have to you know change

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,780
yourself first then probably you will be

00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,850
overcome and grow your agency and how to

00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,590
balance the work life and leisure make

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:43,140
sure that you become an agency owner

00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,000
because you want to balance these work

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,630
and personal life so don't forget about

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,630
that and why in whom I am doing this

00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,520
this is what I have started with and if

00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,140
you can answer these questions probably

00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,220
you will be able to make the decision

00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,159
whether you want to leave the agency

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,919
life with this Sarah the last code and

00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,159
the last slide that says none of us is

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,450
as smart as all of us this is what I

00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,450
