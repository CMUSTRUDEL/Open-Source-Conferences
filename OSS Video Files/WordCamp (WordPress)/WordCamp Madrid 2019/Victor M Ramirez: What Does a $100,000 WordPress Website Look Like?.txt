Title: Victor M Ramirez: What Does a $100,000 WordPress Website Look Like?
Publication date: 2019-05-23
Playlist: WordCamp Madrid 2019
Description: 
	Before joining Dow Jones as a Lead Software Engineer, I built almost a dozen websites valued at over $100,000 each. Many people asked me how I did this and what I included. They’re surprised to learn it wasn’t just code.
I’ll cover case studies as a teaser – MakerBot.com, TodayTix.com, Wibbitz.com. 
From speaking to hundreds of biz owners I have created a blueprint for building sites for small biz that have $100k in value (that they have not even thought of). I will share the blueprint in a non-technical & technical way.
Example: Website support feedback loops. Immediate feedback on support submissions, ticket tracking, CRM integration, & More.
Key Takeaway: How to build & sell websites beyond just a WordPress install and deliver up to $100,000 in value.
This is for people trying to sell these sites or business owners trying to understand what a $100k site looks like.

thank you I'm from New York so I speak

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,889
kind of fast so I'll try to speak slowly

00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:15,600
if you start if I start to lose you just

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,850
kind of fall asleep and I'll see you and

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,080
then I'll know that I need to go a

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,900
little slower cool so this was already

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,759
covered I'm a lead software engineer at

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,710
Dow Jones and we're currently building

00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:34,350
our our whole new editorial system in

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,469
Guttenberg so that's really exciting and

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,170
yeah I am the founder abstract WP but I

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,320
also mentor teaching people to code at

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,670
thankful and I like to share that I give

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,879
back by I run the WordPress NYC meetup

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,609
we have 7,000 members and I teach people

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,350
once a month how to use WordPress so

00:00:53,609 --> 00:01:01,530
that's how I got where I am if you want

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,359
the slides later just tweet at me or if

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,610
you liked something that I said tweet

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,540
about it I like Twitter I like Instagram

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,150
too that's my handle and the hashtag WC

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,570
mad I like encouragement it lets me know

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,830
that you guys like what I'm saying so

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,530
this is irrelevant because I didn't get

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,090
to update that but just again follow on

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,140
Twitter and I will draw the slides in

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,960
there

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,820
this was marked as an advanced talk you

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,170
don't have to be an advanced developer

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,050
to know what I'm gonna talk about today

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,750
or know how to build a 100,000 dollar

00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,390
website but you should know the basics

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,160
of WordPress administration one of the

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,140
problems that I find is a lot of people

00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,240
who try to sell WordPress they actually

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,950
have never used WordPress as a software

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,180
they're a developer they come in and

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,770
they try to build our own custom user

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,540
roles instead of building them in the

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,610
WordPress way so I recommend that you

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,950
really understand how to build custom

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,950
user roles in WordPress how CBTs or

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,290
custom post types work in WordPress

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,480
knowing how to do a proper development

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,590
process and again if you guys are here

00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,710
I'm assuming you're advanced if you're

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,620
not advanced you should know this stuff

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,879
and if you don't know it's alright

00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,540
there's and again these are in the

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,549
slides as of WordPress 5 in December

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,010
LinkedIn learning which used to be Linda

00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:19,650
has the WordPress 5 training for free

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,269
and I really recommend no the code it's

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,530
like these are both free courses that

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:24,900
will get you up to speed they're

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,599
phenomenal and anyone that wants to get

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,129
to WordPress I recommend it to them and

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,120
then finally I have to say this now that

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,519
I'm at Dow Jones in The Wall Street

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,230
Journal this is a big red alert this is

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,140
100% my personal and professional

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,999
opinion anything that I say has nothing

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,319
to do with Dow Jones or The Wall Street

00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:43,799
Journal or any other subsidiaries

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,689
corporations etc and if you explode your

00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:48,510
website or your business it's not Dow

00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:53,640
Jones fault so yeah it's just one for

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:57,989
the lawyers all right moving on so

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,819
building $100,000 WordPress websites let

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,010
me talk about how I got there first I

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,099
was recruited by Dow Jones about a year

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,200
ago and in the negotiations of being

00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:10,799
recruited I said that I wanted to keep

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,530
my business abstract and I had a friend

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,379
who left a start-up in New York City and

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,870
he was a very successful react developer

00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:20,790
and the only problem was that he and the

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,609
other person I brought on they didn't

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,650
know how to sell WordPress so what I had

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,469
to start doing was thinking about how to

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,810
break down WordPress into really simple

00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:33,749
packages that I could easily not only

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,599
communicate to my team members but

00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:38,609
communicate to anyone I'm at so with

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,469
this hopefully not only is it going to

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:43,230
help you you may not solve $100,000

00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:44,549
WordPress websites out of the gate but

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,200
you'll be able to better communicate

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,790
different packages and different ideas

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,889
instead of just speaking like a

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,560
developer or speaking sometimes we get

00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,389
in this I call it like a bubble in

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,249
WordPress where we think everyone should

00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,810
know how great WordPress is or how great

00:03:56,249 --> 00:04:00,299
these things are we have to remember

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,120
that we're only 33% of the Internet so

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,769
far right there's another 67 percent who

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,879
don't know about these things so we have

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,980
to communicate in the language they

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,529
speak so here's what I'm going to cover

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,029
first year the thing about who needs a

00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:17,250
$100,000 website it's not going to be

00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:18,419
everyone you can't just expect and not

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,420
everyone has a hundred thousand dollars

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,640
spent on a website right - I'm gonna

00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,620
cover why they'll pay for it right why

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,450
are they going to pay for this site and

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,889
I'll show you that they're willing to

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,919
pay a hundred thousand dollars for web

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,749
site three I'll show you what makes a

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,460
$100,000 website so what can we sell

00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:37,860
these people how can we fulfill their

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,259
needs and then finally I'll go over some

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,969
real-life examples of $100,000 websites

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,710
around that ballpark that I did hmm

00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:50,490
so excuse me sorry uh who needs a

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,949
$100,000 website right so when I first

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,240
started this process I identified four

00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,169
different types of organizations that

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,919
are using WordPress

00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,150
the first are soloists in DI wires and

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,039
there's and that's fine there's

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,819
hobbyists I would say that our WordPress

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:08,490
meetup 90% of people who work in

00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,080
WordPress are soloists or di wires

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,539
they're using something like a page

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,789
builder they're using something like WP

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,469
engine and I use WP engine too but

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,419
they're using things that take care of

00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:20,520
all of the logic for them they're not

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,169
doing the advanced development everyone

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,599
that uses their site if it's like them

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,069
and their spouse they're both admins

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,210
right they don't use the custom user

00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:32,069
roles and that's fine

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,469
number two are those not using WordPress

00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,789
yet so we have to think about how do you

00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:38,659
know the people who they don't

00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:41,580
understand the value of WordPress right

00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,889
three I would say is organizations WP

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,289
leads these might be a nonprofit the

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,699
these might be like a hospital or an

00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,979
organization you know it's interesting

00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,520
to me how many lawyers law firms

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,110
hospitals etc they use a wordpress

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,089
website but they have that one key

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,919
person that manages the WordPress

00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,870
website and a lot of the times that

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,129
person's overwhelmed and they need

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,589
someone to help them to take that

00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:06,449
website to the next level and then

00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,310
finally and this is like the this is the

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,180
best type of person that needs $100,000

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,159
WordPress website

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,419
multi-user WordPress and what I mean by

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:14,360
that and I'll I'll give some more

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,430
examples of that in the next slide so

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,800
these are the examples of those four

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,300
organizations the first one we're not

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,849
even going to cover this is they'll

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,349
never buy a $100,000 website because

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:27,930
they'll never see the value of hiring

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:31,050
someone to build it for them it's the

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,189
site owner or the DIY er right they're

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,689
always going to try to find a better

00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:34,979
plugin they're always going to try to

00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,750
find a snippet they're always going to

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,459
try to find someone just fill in the

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,769
hole fill in the blanks for them they

00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:43,450
don't need you and that's fine and that

00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:45,700
not everyone is a perfect customer

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,220
the second one is people using

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,100
Squarespace people using Drupal people

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,480
using things like crafts CMS I got a lot

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,250
of advertisements or crafts CMS because

00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,340
I guess I have WordPress as a keyword in

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,230
my Twitter bio or whenever if you ever

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,880
mention if you ever see on Twitter where

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,710
someone says I'm doing a new website

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,270
what do you guys recommend to craft CMS

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:09,100
has a bot that just tells people craft

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,360
CMS craft CMS and so yeah so those

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,190
people they don't really they may not

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,840
understand the benefits of open source

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,610
they may not understand that Squarespace

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,310
isn't a CMS it's just a website builder

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,250
I'll getting out a little bit the third

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,750
is again like back to the organization's

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,080
of the WordPress lead it might be a

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,000
non-profit with a single WP admin or

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,500
small agency they're working with that's

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,600
not really a wordpress agency they're

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,120
like a marketing agency that happens to

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,680
do WordPress sometimes right and then

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,080
forth and then again like this is the

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,300
most important our publishers or

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,160
multirole stores and so the real beauty

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,410
of WordPress and you see this a lot with

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,180
the WooCommerce a lot of the times

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,580
people build a WooCommerce site and

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,530
they're like well I paid a guy $500 and

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,330
just doesn't work and I think what they

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,920
don't understand is that if you think

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,770
about the way a store works even

00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,870
physically outside of you know a digital

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,400
space there's a lot of different things

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,600
there's the person filling the inventory

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
the person filling the order is the

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,570
person doing credit card processing the

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,070
person doing the invoice is the person

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,440
designing the emails are really great

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,390
competitive and if you want to be Amazon

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,430
I don't know how it is here in Spain but

00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,470
that's your number one competitor if you

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,870
want to sell online in the United States

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,980
it's Amazon and if you want to be Amazon

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,140
you have to create such a great

00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,760
experience and so that's like why I

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,460
think number four that's really great

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,200
and the same thing publishers the Wall

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,330
Street Journal and Dow Jones and other

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,100
publishers we have multi user roles we

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,690
have and no one is an admin except for

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,120
the devs and we don't even have admin

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,730
role on the production it's only on dad

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,140
and QA and so there's editors writers

00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,880
photo journalists all these different

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,440
roles and those are gonna be the focus

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,980
for the talk we're not gonna talk about

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,980
di wires

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,700
there we go okay sorry I'm hitting this

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,900
thing really hard ah all right

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:55,330
so how do we find the people that need

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,200
this $100,000 website right and these

00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,240
are there's a bunch of different

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,340
indicators like one of my indicators is

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,110
never work with a business owner don't

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,810
work with an individual owner targeted

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,300
CMO targeted marketing manager targeted

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,950
CTO target those people because if you

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,380
work with like a individual business

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,930
owner I've even found organizations with

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,180
like 20 people but the business owner is

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,000
so close to those 20 people and

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,820
micromanaging them that he's so close to

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,339
the wallet that when he set subside of

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,870
$100,000 budget he'll start to say well

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,130
how can we get it down to 50,000 when

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,440
something else starts to hurt right

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,000
whereas a CMO they're given like you

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,290
know a 1 million dollar budget a hundred

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,940
thousand dollar budget they have a

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,890
budget to spend and they will allocate

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,589
resources towards you if you can show

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,540
them the value of those resources so

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,240
revenue threshold is one of them and

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,370
I'll get into those regularly updated

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,600
content so they regularly updating their

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,060
content if you have someone with a

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,490
website but they never post anything or

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,980
they never share any content they're not

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,660
going to value a CMS right and it's not

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,980
just blogs it could be are they adding

00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,330
product regularly are they updating

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,210
prices are they doing sales they're

00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:04,180
doing promotions third is organization

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,250
size right so how big of an organization

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,070
are they fourth and this is a big one

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,540
industry compliance so if you can find a

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,580
niche where you can find some kind of

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,530
industry compliance and I'll give a

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,110
great example of that after and it when

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,430
I get the next slide it's almost like

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,020
you just can it's like shooting fish in

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,460
a barrel because once you get that first

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,990
person who realizes they're getting sued

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,190
for something all their friends are

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,910
getting sued too and they're gonna call

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,350
you up so here's a quick revenue value

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,209
indicator there's many different ways to

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,920
find out the revenue business for some

00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,240
reason when you ask people what was your

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,310
revenue last year if people get real

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,900
awkward and ooh we got to talk about

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,750
that but I think they forget that

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,209
there's math and so you can just say oh

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,660
they have 10 employees in New York City

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,890
and employees in HR and this etc and

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,500
they might have an average salary of

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,610
$100,000 I could go on the last door and

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,770
find out their average employee salary

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,990
and I would assume that if they haven't

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,090
10 employees are paying an average

00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,610
$100,000 they're not spending more than

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,660
fifty percent on labor costs so we could

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,550
say the two million dollars in revenue

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,920
another thing you can check out is

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,840
CrunchBase CrunchBase keeps data on a

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,210
lot of different startups funding around

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,280
etc and there's another great company

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,580
called data and eyes and date and eyes

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,560
it merges data with LinkedIn CrunchBase

00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,300
tax data a bunch of different things I

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,950
don't know if it's available here in

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,950
Spain but it's it's a very high quality

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,420
product it starts like $1,000 a month

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,890
but it is it's like that's if you if

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,300
you're like a larger agency trying to

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:35,410
sell what am I doing wrong you are there

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,570
you go okay so content value indicators

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,250
do they regularly update their site

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,530
again I spoke about this but if you have

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,910
someone know if they're regularly

00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,370
updating and that's what's kind of funny

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,170
you'll find these bloggers or these like

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,090
stores and they're updating their

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,380
Instagram every five minutes they're

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:54,340
updating their Twitter every five

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:57,910
minutes and why because it's so easy yet

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,980
WordPress isn't there right and so if

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,260
you follow and you can create a great

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,450
user experience and that's what we're

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,130
trying to do you know in newsrooms and

00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,660
Dow Jones and hopefully also they're

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,700
trying to do with Guttenberg which is

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,430
that it's a user experience that is

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,050
simple and so for example like you know

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,550
I'm get rid of the clutter and the user

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,490
interface and make it so that someone

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,920
can just like login post a photo one of

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,780
the best examples that I see if anyone

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,330
follows any kind of publications I think

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:28,030
Vice magazine does it New York Magazine

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:30,730
does it they all say click the link in

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,260
the bio to see the post right that would

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,050
just be setting up a custom post type

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,150
that links to the article and that they

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,620
all do that in Instagram and that could

00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,690
even be done for a store where you

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,340
feature a product so if they're updating

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,570
their content outside of WordPress you

00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,040
can sell them and say hey look we're

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,990
going to make it just as easy as your

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,230
Instagram or even using the API to tie

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,230
them together

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,630
organization size indicators larger

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,730
organizations have larger needs right so

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,070
for example there was a publisher that I

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,560
recently spoke with and they have their

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,180
own API for all of their books and their

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,110
books API is something like hundreds of

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,940
thousands of books and they did not want

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,910
to create a custom page for each of

00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,670
these and they understood the

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,640
you of can we have a CMS dynamically

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:20,550
populate every single book as a post or

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,960
a page in our website and so once they

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,060
understood that then it was more of a

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,860
story of st. you know and them saving

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,540
the labor costs because once I had the

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,330
conversation with them they were having

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,620
people manually add every single book

00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,940
and I think they had stopped at three

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,800
thousand when they realized it was just

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,960
too big of a job and they were like we

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,280
have an API can't you you know people

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,010
use API as for Instagram can't we use

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,050
our API to populate books and large

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,580
organizations for larger needs you can

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,650
also and when I get into some of the

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,240
case studies you know there are

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,010
organizations where it's not a one-man

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,840
show entering content and it might be

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,400
someone who needs to hire contributing

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,220
writers they want to hire freelancers

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,200
and you as the WordPress expert can

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,410
educate them how you can use custom post

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,480
statuses custom posts custom post types

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:07,290
and custom user roles to control the

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,710
workflow of those users industry

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,740
compliance is another huge value and so

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,870
are they Deb's schools are medical right

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,880
this is huge this is um this is a big

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,110
thing going on in the United States we

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,020
have something called the American

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:25,200
Disabilities Act I'm not a lawyer so I'm

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,780
gonna paraphrase this it essentially

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,870
says that any public property that is

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:33,240
fair use of your business has to be

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,750
readily accessible to people with

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,840
disabilities there is a large grocery

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,280
chain in the United States that spent

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,640
seven million dollars on a brand-new

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:47,130
website and a federal court ruled that

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,140
that website because you need to use the

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,730
website to get the coupons you need to

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,410
use the website to get the prices you

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,750
need to get used the website to get the

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,010
newsletter that is now fair in public

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,130
grounds and therefore it must be

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,770
eighty-eight accessible and they got

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,110
sued and they had to pay five hundred

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:06,270
thousand dollars to the guy who couldn't

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,620
use a site and they had to pay five

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,200
hundred thousand dollars to fix the site

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,660
and so now the big thing is all these

00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,920
art galleries they all have websites to

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,350
sell their art well guess what

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,720
the art gallery website is an extension

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,980
of their art gallery and so they're

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,500
having lawsuits like crazy in Los

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,410
Angeles New York Minneapolis very hot

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,449
art scenes and that's like been of great

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,769
lead driver for us and also thinking

00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:30,959
medical in the United States you have

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,819
HIPPA gdpr is a great thing going to

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,859
these businesses and saying hey I notice

00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:38,399
that you deal with data and those are

00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:40,529
you from value cells and so they're

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,819
looking for experts right so the kind of

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,739
people the people they listed before

00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:45,629
they're not looking for an implementer

00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:47,339
and you can also educate them because

00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:50,309
one of the problems and again it's not a

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,439
problem so Louis di wires they're 90% of

00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:53,729
people who come to me meetups and and

00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:55,889
that's who helps build the WordPress

00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:56,909
space but the people that you're trying

00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,129
to sell these hundred thousand dollar

00:15:56,909 --> 00:16:01,109
websites to they don't want this in an

00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:03,299
implementer workflow I installed it it

00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:05,699
works thank you that's like a 30 minute

00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,709
install right but it's a professional

00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:10,470
developer this is a professional

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:13,169
developer workflow discovery development

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,299
and unit testing Quality Assurance and

00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:18,720
integration testing deployment and

00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:20,369
monitoring right if no one's familiar

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,839
with that by the way it's just a

00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:23,449
standard development workflow again the

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,349
slides would be there you can look it up

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,079
but I want to get to the stuff that you

00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:31,579
guys probably came for there we go

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,959
so let's price via developer workflow

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:36,509
this is just a quick salary calculation

00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,279
that I just did for myself it's

00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:41,489
essentially my desired annual salary

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,309
plus my costs with weekly hours times

00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:45,389
the working weeks it's it's it doesn't

00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,029
it's all really important again like

00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,289
these will be on the slides but knowing

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,809
that I live in New York City I need to

00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:54,629
make $100,000 yes is unfortunate just to

00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:56,039
afford a studio apartment 24 thousand

00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:58,619
dollars from my medical costs and made

00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,299
my hardware and I'm only working 25

00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,989
hours a week because 25 hours of

00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:03,299
production

00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:05,069
I need another 15 hours to go and sell

00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:07,319
right so you have to be realistic you

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,230
can't freelance 40 hours a week so I

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:13,850
have to charge 103 an hour so knowing

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,860
that I charged 103 dollars an hour right

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,419
let's think about again we're not doing

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,909
the 30 minute install we're doing a

00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,069
proper development workflow because of

00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:24,990
compliance reasons we can't look what

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,149
happened with pip dig right we can't

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,279
just go and install a plug-in and expect

00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:30,269
it to be all great with our business

00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,009
right we should be using things like

00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:33,240
query monitor you should be using things

00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,129
like if you don't know what this is you

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,019
can look it up load balancers that go

00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:38,770
and check what call-outs are being made

00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,090
from the DNS right

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,860
and so those are the things you can talk

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,000
to your client about but these are

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,200
things that you could easily sell

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,309
knowing if you follow the development

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,770
workflow they should take at least five

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:50,200
hours custom user roles who are your

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,650
users what are their capabilities what

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,720
will they do

00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,040
not everyone's give me an admin so who

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,800
will be an admin who will have these

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,240
capabilities will you have SSO that

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,220
could take a whole another five hours or

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,050
you can use G suite or you guys octa are

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,770
gonna use off the zero forum

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,350
integrations

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,480
what's your CRM is an API do you want to

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,670
connect via zapier if not zapier do you

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,150
want to use this all of these different

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,110
things mail sent via smtp if everyone's

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,970
not familiar there's something called a

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,980
Deadman snitch you can't just set up

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,870
mail smtp you got to set up something to

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,210
make sure that the mail sending gravity

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,800
forms had an update and you know it

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,030
wasn't sending email from MailChimp and

00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,070
people only found out when they got a

00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,570
complaint from their customers but you

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,940
can set up different things and sell

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,440
those as value adds and one of my

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,460
favorites this is like an old this is

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,280
like one of the coolest things ever

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,650
found you can brand all of your for your

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,950
error pages not just your 404 you can

00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,980
drop an HTML file for your error

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,590
establishing database connection and for

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,820
your update and progress so when you're

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,920
updating the website people get that

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,210
white screen you can drop an HTML file

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,240
and that's a value add for your

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,100
customers but there's more right so what

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,660
else can we do now let's talk about

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,280
knowing that we're doing a developer

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,340
workflow these are things that should

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,470
take I would argue at least 18 to 20

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,940
hours and again we didn't get into

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,740
design yet that's I think too many

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,059
people are like I'm competing against

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,100
elementary I'm competing against page

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,480
builders all of those things have

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,710
nothing to do with page builders and

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,990
that's the stuff that all the page

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,510
builder people forget we're building a

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,820
custom CMS so custom develoment from

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,830
design sure CRM integration with lead

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,190
scoring if they visit certain pages

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,620
score them as a hot lead custom

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,330
Guttenberg box and api's feedback loops

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,010
support and pre sale there's nothing I

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,380
hate more than visiting a website

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,540
filling in a form and nothing happens

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,940
did like they just send my email to how

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,530
did it go like where did it go right and

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,990
I want to receipt and so that's

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,300
something customers your customers may

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,830
not think about and then one of my

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,720
favorite things to sell now is like I

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,490
worked with the beauty salon and we sold

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,480
an affiliate linking system they were

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,950
like oh we can't get

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,140
people to buy product because they just

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,850
buy on Amazon and we said well you're on

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,600
the you know Good Morning America every

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,830
morning why don't we just have your

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,360
stylists list their favorite products

00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,090
and will auto affiliate link using

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,140
something like 30 thirsty affiliates and

00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,049
I'll get into some of this in the case

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,510
studies these are items easily worth

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:15,640
$5,000 and someone just if you guys were

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,590
at the talk before this on that mobile

00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,110
application integrating with a custom

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,210
REST API I'd argue that's ten to fifteen

00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,400
thousand dollar project minimum Amazon

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,010
poly integration so free that's a huge

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,960
thing voice is going to account for 33%

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,370
of internet searches soon and so getting

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,440
your customers ready for that selling

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,049
them on something exciting advanced

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,640
content types of the user journey

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:38,820
ongoing accessibility testing compliance

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,809
again thinking about the art galleries

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,290
accessibility is not just set it and

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,330
forget it

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,010
it is something an ongoing process that

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,070
has to be done over and over and over

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,690
again as web standards change and then

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,309
finally doing multi laying

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,690
implementations multi learning

00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,030
implementations are very complicated

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,370
it's not just creating duplicate pages

00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,860
with matching content there's SEO stuff

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:03,730
and there's accessibility usability

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,260
features in there and this is everyone

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,450
always says to me what about Squarespace

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,950
again forget about Squarespace because

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,540
it's not even the same thing once you

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,929
start to understand your client

00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,240
understands that hey look Squarespace is

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,700
a page builder it doesn't have REST API

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,840
integrations you could build it custom

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,910
and it would cost you hundreds of

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,919
thousands of dollars but WordPress comes

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,350
with the recipe ASP is WordPress comes

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,090
you can get again very easily do link

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:32,080
masking do a lot of different

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:35,620
interesting things so I'm going to share

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,210
two case studies where I and again I

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,330
fell into this more just because these

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,460
clients they essentially told me their

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:46,299
problems and I productized what I

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:48,549
thought they needed so this startup

00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:50,200
called todaytix there are ninety million

00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,750
dollar broadway ticketing startup in New

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,580
York City and what happened was they

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,360
have an iOS application an Android

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,970
application

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,890
they had a Windows Phone application and

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,510
they have a website and the websites

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,980
built in react and they said we don't

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,290
want to build a whole new WordPress

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,280
website can we just get the blogpost

00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,200
into here

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,450
but we're hiring all freelance writers

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,970
in 30 different countries in 30

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,500
different locations how do we get them

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,620
all onto the same site and they can't

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,230
edit each other's posts okay cool we did

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,510
a custom REST API integrations based on

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,610
location and we did custom user roles

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,920
based on location and based on different

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,200
teams it was very easy and they were you

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,430
know the master person who was in New

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,220
York City was able to add and remove

00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:35,320
street teams as needed we set up a

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,060
landing page module for AdWords if you

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,590
ever want to sell like a quick one

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,800
thousand to five thousand dollar product

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,800
to your customer Unbounce the trashiest

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,170
version of Unbounce

00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,430
is it : yeah Unbounce the landing page

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,660
builder or leadpages they're twelve

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,700
hundred to two thousand dollars a year

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,740
so you just see to your customer you set

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,480
up a custom post type of promotions with

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,070
a page builder with a pop-up thing and a

00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,320
couple other things in there you can

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,150
recreate unbound synth row WP rocket on

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,370
there and say hey now you just saved

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,900
yourself $2,000 a year and you and by

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,050
the way it's fully custom with unlimited

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,700
capabilities we set up multi Lang with

00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,220
English and Spanish and again

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,050
integration of the iOS and react custom

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,790
CMS dashboards so again making it so

00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,400
that every person saw it differently and

00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,570
then ruffling internationalisation you

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,120
guys in google that after that's more

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,100
like just making it so that there's no

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,610
SEO penalization for duplicate content

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,810
in different regions and that's why I

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,280
didn't do this in Spanish even though I

00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,700
speak Spanish a little bit I have no

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:37,300
idea how to say that in Spanish okay so

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,980
with it's an AI startup I worked with we

00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,660
did landing page similar landing page

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,190
modules for ads it's an easy sell

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,780
everyone's running Facebook ads

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,460
everyone's learning Twitter ads their

00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,070
landing pages are garbage and all you

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,260
have to do is sell them a better option

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,540
we did geoip content planning for us

00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,070
Israel and France they have an office in

00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,780
Israel they have an office in Paris and

00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,300
they have an office in New York we're

00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,640
running into we had a 50% drop off rate

00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:05,410
on our sign up so Marketo forms so we

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,930
used WP engine geoip to target and you

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,850
know and should serve different forms by

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,410
different regions so we still we didn't

00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,660
get the drop-off in our sign ups in

00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,840
certain regions but of course at gdpr we

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,880
did lose some we also did some speed

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,870
optimization in training and then we did

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,030
I think like five differ

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,559
custom post types and each custom post

00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,270
type is managed by a different team

00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:26,500
because they have a lot of divisions of

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,260
people are doing different things in

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,830
different countries in different regions

00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:35,200
so I have five minutes for questions I

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,790
went through that fairly quickly again

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,170
this just tweet at me I didn't get a

00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,300
chance to do this I was at another

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,070
conference speaking yesterday too so

00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,140
this will be live but I'll tweet the

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,840
slides to you guys this I'm actually

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,420
turning this into a mini course but I

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,330
just have not had time to work on it

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:55,710
so yeah questions I see a hand up there

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:59,500
it's really there's a light in my eye so

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:05,440
I'm gonna get have a microphone oh I see

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:08,080
14 where hi there thanks for the talk a

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,170
best talk for me so far

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,960
I think a lot of what you covered it's

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,330
obviously very very relevant but I think

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,920
one of the main challenges is is getting

00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,780
in front of these clients in the first

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,750
place right so do you have any feedback

00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:26,290
on how to get in front of those clients

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,910
so it's a long journey because one of

00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,130
the things I tell clients before they

00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,610
hire developer is to Google people if

00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:35,770
you Google Victor Ramirez WordPress I

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,270
rank like for the first two pages that

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,190
was very hard to do Victor Ramirez is

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,559
the John Smith Latino names there's

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:44,170
3,000 of them in New York City he's also

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:46,990
very popular salsa player and the

00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,340
senator so I had to beat him but I beat

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,200
him for Victor Ramirez WordPress not

00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,700
normal Victor Ramirez right and the way

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,320
I did that was speaking at events like

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,570
this and getting you know this is a high

00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,800
value link someone mentions my name and

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:01,840
it shows up you know I I run a meetup I

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,860
contribute so make sure that you're you

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,809
know you're involved in the WordPress

00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,820
community and that's like a badge and

00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:09,460
people will find you that way another

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,870
way to is you know um there's an actual

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:16,809
amazing book I recommend it's called

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:19,300
get leads now and it's about it's about

00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:20,890
making sales a habit we're essentially

00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,540
every day you should be reaching out

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,860
like you know when you have a meet-up or

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,900
you have an event or you have contacts

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,760
reaching out to those people and just

00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,310
you know having some kind again not

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,500
selling essentially saying like hey did

00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,549
you know about the gdpr thing here's a

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,989
great article on that hey

00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:36,820
did you know about this and just being

00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:38,169
consistent it's not something's gonna

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,730
happen that's why I said before it's not

00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:44,639
gonna happen in one day it's not gonna

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:50,039
happen in one month so I can't see oh

00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:50,039
yeah I'm gonna hide over here

00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:01,960
one of the points you value of us high

00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:03,460
value is making most lingual sites what

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,570
solution do you use for modeling well

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,090
that can be trusted for such big clients

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:12,100
so it it totally depends on the client

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:15,039
right so for like startup sites I just

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,840
use wpml the reason I like wpml it

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,029
creates a custom user role of translator

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,159
and that translator can be restrict if

00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:24,220
you know how to w females interface is

00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:27,460
not great but the capabilities are great

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,159
in that you can limit a translator to

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,590
only the post that you assign them and

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,450
they have an approval process but for

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,470
things like more complicated with a big

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,740
publisher where they're doing like

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,990
hundreds opposed today or a week I

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:46,600
recommend just we do custom or recently

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:50,110
I've used Pali Lang how about you on

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,480
time okay one more one more question

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,250
guys you can tweet at me too I actually

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,710
answer my tweets a lot of pressure last

00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:59,020
question how do you tackle the fact that

00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,419
your developer in in some of those

00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,210
companies with big budgets one like a

00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:07,120
big company to trust how do you face

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:13,149
that that they they want a more like a

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,679
team so what so when I go to these one

00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,000
of the big things I'm doing now and I

00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:18,279
had to learn this when I first started

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,679
that Dow Jones was that when people hire

00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,870
me I essentially tell them you're buying

00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,760
into my system you're not buying me I

00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,200
will not answer your emails I won't

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,970
answer your phone calls if you want a

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,440
bat phone to me it's two thousand

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:32,440
dollars a month and that usually just

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,789
gets them out away because they tell

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,659
them I work at Dow Jones I work at The

00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:36,640
Wall Street Journal and I'm not

00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:38,649
available but I'm I've developed these

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,480
systems I showed them demos I actually

00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:45,850
have everything here as demos on my WP

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,309
engine account as blueprints and I will

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,440
live demo this for clients and leads and

00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,909
show them what I've built and so that's

00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,289
kind of the thing and I say look like

00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:56,740
when you're hiring me and I have my

00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:58,020
partner my new partner Derek who left

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,610
the startup and is working with me

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,659
that's part of he's doing the sales for

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,520
me now where I'll say hey I'm gonna hand

00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,169
you off the Derek any advanced questions

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,030
you have I will meet with you and Derek

00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:08,680
and Derek will schedule a call so

00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,720
almost kind of creating a barrier and

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,890
that barrier all of a sudden makes

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,900
people think you have a team it's like

00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,670
if you're the person if you answer the

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,780
phone for your client for these larger

00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,400
client's you've already lost because

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,270
they're not gonna they want it if I get

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,800
hit by a truck

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,470
they know that Derrick can like go and

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,000
pick up my wpengine a cow and hopefully

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:28,210
attend the funeral and you know and

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,250
they're gonna be okay so that's one

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:36,900
perhaps I will team up at home talk it

00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:36,900
out again I can't see you but yeah

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,480
I have a question it's regarding

00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:50,309
documentation of those projects it's big

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,019
project you know for big companies how

00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:54,659
do you handle documentation for all of

00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:58,340
that you do for those projects you know

00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:02,190
so I do them to manage yeah yeah so um

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:04,260
you should productize these things so I

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,450
can talk about this because this is

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,120
something we're open sourcing one of the

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,309
problems at organizations like Dow Jones

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,230
The Wall Street Journal etc is that

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,630
they've the same problem that you guys

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,250
have you may adopt a wordpress website

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,120
and they have 50 different plugins and

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,980
these other people have 50 different

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,419
plugins and these have you know someone

00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,669
else is using this and someone's using

00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,799
that you should have your own standard

00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:28,830
kit of things that you're used to right

00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,269
and so for example I always use beaver

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,460
builder white label for my landing pages

00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:35,039
I always use wpml for my startup

00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,260
translation I always use so a lot of the

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,120
documentation is just it's it's wash

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,220
rinse and repeat that first clients

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,500
gonna be the most expensive one but a

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,630
lot of its repeated I also recommend oh

00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,549
man they killed it actually but there

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,809
was an application called clarify and

00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:50,730
what it would do is let you take

00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:53,100
screenshots and would progressively add

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,929
them to a Google Doc but I also use a

00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,149
tool called ScreenFlow and we record

00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,250
custom videos and then as far as the

00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:02,309
WordPress documentation goes if you

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:05,429
follow default WordPress standards you

00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:07,230
can install something like it's from the

00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,899
guys white label CMS that's called view

00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,940
of video user manuals and they let you

00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:13,590
white label their manual and that's the

00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,510
great thing as long as you don't do this

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:18,480
crazy version of WordPress as long as

00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:20,190
you use a CF guttenberg of a standard

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,539
you know the WordPress standards that

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,889
documentation are exist there's a

00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,019
cottage industry of people making

00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:26,549
documentation for you and then all you

00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,200
have to do for the custom post types is

00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:32,480
record a quick video is something like

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,480
