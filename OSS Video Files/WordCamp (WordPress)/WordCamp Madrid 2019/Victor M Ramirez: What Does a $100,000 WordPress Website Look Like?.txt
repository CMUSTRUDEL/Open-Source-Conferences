Description: 
	Before joining Dow Jones as a Lead Software Engineer, I built almost a dozen websites valued at over $100,000 each. Many people asked me how I did this and what I included. They’re surprised to learn it wasn’t just code.
I’ll cover case studies as a teaser – MakerBot.com, TodayTix.com, Wibbitz.com. 
From speaking to hundreds of biz owners I have created a blueprint for building sites for small biz that have $100k in value (that they have not even thought of). I will share the blueprint in a non-technical & technical way.
Example: Website support feedback loops. Immediate feedback on support submissions, ticket tracking, CRM integration, & More.
Key Takeaway: How to build & sell websites beyond just a WordPress install and deliver up to $100,000 in value.
This is for people trying to sell these sites or business owners trying to understand what a $100k site looks like.
