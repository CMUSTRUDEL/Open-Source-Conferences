everyone is especially a technical

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,500
writer for antinea so my topic is how to

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,000
create WordPress websites without for me

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,929
now

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,240
as a technical writer and usually the

00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:25,320
bridge between people who are not used

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,600
to mone have developers because see one

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,789
of the reasons why WordPress is so

00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,470
popular is because we also cater to

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,859
people who don't necessarily know about

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,530
pudding soon my wordpress website this

00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,809
website is meant the products that we

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,829
make are also for people who doesn't

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,530
necessarily do not know about moving so

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,320
I will introduce myself a bit

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,960
so our workers enthusiastic starting

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,620
back from my field I don't necessarily

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,289
know a lot about coding I always go for

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,680
websites that are simple so I'm

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,589
anticipating from the user perspective

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,100
how users see your certain website how

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,899
would they get used to plugins because

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:15,170
when you're new to WordPress it can be a

00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:15,170
bit overwhelming so the problem

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,850
because there are so many plugins and

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,659
themes in with us right now that you

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,390
need to find new problems that you can

00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:29,130
follow or give a solution to and that's

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,649
what you need to think you need to be a

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,740
thing fair enough to be associated with

00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:36,869
WordPress because what kind of products

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,700
would work for WordPress now now that

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,289
there are so many plugins it's like it

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,600
what do you need so that's it started so

00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:47,429
for instance that might be obsessed

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,490
without coding is I don't know buddy I

00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:54,450
can hire a developer or I think we'll to

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,940
others for that so when you're building

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,700
your own website you have their complete

00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,039
independence you can choose or you can

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,500
change however you want without

00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,560
depending on someone you don't need any

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,509
HTML knowledge and you can redesign when

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,989
you're in a competitive field you need a

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:15,150
website that is continuously updated so

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:19,110
that you have a competitive edge with

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,880
your website against others and maybe

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,489
intuitions see when you're building your

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,700
website you need other you need to

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,650
depend on third-party River so there is

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,620
this factor of major integration with

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:36,510
other websites or other social media so

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,720
the question is my WordPress there are

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:45,459
other CMS platforms as well so reckless

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,819
is good for out of all fearlessness

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:53,739
versus rants about 59% of all the total

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:56,349
cinemas so it's popular when I read you

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,510
as the user when a user was less normal

00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:00,700
is recording are building websites to

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,439
Google the first name that pops up is

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,469
WordPress how do the Germans say it's

00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:07,420
with WordPress so when you get this much

00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,790
of a popular website you have a huge

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,129
community we we are doing this work can

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,620
pull it the year after year at wordcamp

00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:16,780
serving popular are being successful

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,909
because of our community so that

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,220
community gives us free support if I

00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:23,980
would start somewhere if I'm not okay

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,060
with something I have this peer support

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,400
from our mattress work for free you can

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,590
create anything no matter what wish you

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,109
have you no matter what kind of website

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,760
you want to live you can basically build

00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:39,099
anything between you whether it's a

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,930
crowdfunding site or your work or you

00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:45,750
are looking by so platform mechanism you

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,870
can create anything with particulars and

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,629
easy.you

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,970
user interface like you want it to be

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:55,730
user and then after you own

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,170
for someone who is visiting so even

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,050
without any coding knowledge you can

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,600
start with murders and it's highly

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,490
customizable we want to build a website

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,830
anyone wants to deliver say they want

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,840
our website to be unique so when you

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,380
have a customizable option when you've

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,750
been customized according to your wishes

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,910
you can make your green website using

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,160
orders and all these the cost is a huge

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,260
factor suppose you're building your

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,630
skills or you're just trying out we want

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,300
to build your skills as someone who

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,620
loves to make reference what a surprise

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,330
I get about this earlier

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,190
you want to go for blogging you don't

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,080
have the huge relative reckless is the

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,290
option to grow and there were some level

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,290
of security that you can have the

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,050
parameters so the question is a

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,710
developer if I if I was a doubler why

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,020
would I need websites without putting

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,570
parallel musings for that firstly when

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,510
you're building a website your customers

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,850
didn't buy in ten hours of work they

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,960
want a solution they don't necessarily

00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,960
know that

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,130
they want the solutions when the website

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,840
there being for you to build so and user

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,040
abundance is something that you need to

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,380
understand when you're building your

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,450
website it's open source you know what

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,490
you're getting with WordPress and you

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,910
can customize your reports as much as

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,440
you can as most of you already know one

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,300
of the most favorite things that we need

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,580
to consider is higher efficiency when

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,370
you're building your website using

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,920
WordPress you have some work already

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,110
done for you so you could spend your

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,870
time you're putting others in some in

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:37,800
things that you can actually use are to

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,560
improve your site good on top of SEO

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,010
friendly further assume it's something

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,070
that we work with a lot these days is

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:49,800
extremely not just for yourself use if

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,530
you're a developer of Units developer if

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,810
you are able to do the website that is

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:59,040
humanly your clients will be more

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,199
interested by for me so what you're

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,300
doing is when you're building a slow

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,569
sighs WordPress actually acknowledged

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,969
even pushing your website on WordPress

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,580
you would get some organic practically

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:13,319
an inverse functionality some things

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,810
when you're planning your website

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,939
WordPress has a lot of things for you

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,590
but you've been you can go to other

00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,930
sites for student work which you can

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,879
actually as a newbie they look great you

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,139
can actually see what you can get from

00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:30,479
workers so how can you make WordPress

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,719
websites without ruining this is from a

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,860
completely user perspective who doesn't

00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:41,279
know how to start with workers so two

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,439
options that we know there's page

00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,479
builders which is obviously the popular

00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,219
one and the second one is buidling

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,289
something that we are still figuring now

00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:51,710
figure them out or something we are

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:55,110
still unsure what we are getting aged

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:57,479
another way that is that would be a very

00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,990
popular rate reviews is losing both go

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,629
to read and a page-turner

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,279
so why your stage builders because a lot

00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:09,180
of people complain that page builders

00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:12,169
are slow or if I'm someone who's using a

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,169
page winner and I get

00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:18,840
so for random semantics or another

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:21,770
corner if you want if you want to build

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,820
a website us at least compatibilities

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:29,040
resident in this community in Europe in

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,950
your industry you would need a website

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,020
with some basic functions and if you

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,950
don't have the knowledge for it then how

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,840
do you start one of the things that we

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,410
dress our fields from become an

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,670
intuitive

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,890
sometimes when you're building your

00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:47,250
website you're building our websites for

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:49,440
other people their moment they actually

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,470
want from their asset from the start

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,880
suppose you want to log in page does

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,380
your login page that were attached

00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,360
option does it not so the thing is that

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,400
when you using a page builder even my

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,950
seeds of certain options you will know

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,780
what you want from your website this is

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,940
great for long borders for people who

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,310
are completing if you will move industry

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:16,200
and there are so many options like I

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:19,230
want I have a thought but how do I make

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,480
that funny to be so many see those

00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,760
options here and be able to explore what

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,280
you can do with your website it opens

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,410
horizons for you in page builders and

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,330
since there are so many pages of this

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,830
right now America

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,779
each one is trying to be better than the

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,839
other which is why there are even more

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:38,539
options right now than ever before and

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,310
the only thing is amplification even

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,570
though they look or maybe you experience

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,669
and then when you're recording something

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,339
she will switch so many functions in

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,370
your website that your visitors may get

00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:51,860
confused or if you're working on a team

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,779
there might be some confusions so

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,060
simplification is team and you want to

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:58,850
build a website that is fully functional

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,180
your visitors should see a website that

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:06,680
is the visitors can help you do that

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:09,050
you have team blocks that you can get

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,149
from your page builder layouts

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:15,709
well done layers that have been tested

00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:17,060
again and true and true again everything

00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:19,760
else you get support when you're

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,160
interesting page builder you get support

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,160
from a small team of developers if

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,620
you're a startup or we're just building

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,380
a website by yourself you need us that

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,680
sort of support that strong support will

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,720
help you build your website clearly it's

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,550
cost efficient it's true because you're

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,459
investing on one playing even if the

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,829
website takes off you can actually earn

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:45,620
a lot more in exponentially from the

00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:47,690
website as faster too because when

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,880
you're building your website when you're

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,970
focusing will reach to the state of so

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,680
much of off your hands you have time to

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,959
it's going to other options with your

00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,180
websites how to make it better how to

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:04,130
make better content

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,810
often make it kind of better so let me

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,330
tell you about some of the basics of

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,640
using page Reuters so now the example

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:14,180
that we use it is the beach printers

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,030
front of us so you can use it from any

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,730
page so first you have to do is install

00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:22,100
your desired page that our plugin you

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,960
can work from what prisoners on three

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:30,290
months free will send you have more

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:33,230
people it's usually but didn't install

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:36,400
your desired peace with your plugin and

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,750
then just research your title you're

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,420
communicating represent you would

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,610
normally do and start editing with the

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,820
people that you're using and you're

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,350
ready to publish your page now one thing

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,270
is important that whenever you're

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,700
building your website using a page will

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,460
reduce the page will return them that

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,220
way the appearance of your website is

00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,530
false because their plan when they're

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,260
making a website using WordPress page 2

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:06,710
or any page Moodle using their tip

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:10,250
template makes it look like how they

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,340
imagined now start anything with your

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,720
page builder so this is important even

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,019
the page builder takes a lot of

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,019
functions

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:23,579
Nikolas and Emily you're don't want miss

00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:26,069
planning your website so a lot of rules

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:28,699
that you want call out section what kind

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:31,470
of bonds see the time that you are

00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:32,730
getting free firm from nothing with

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,459
Facebook beginning to let us know

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,529
planning the website itself like how

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,220
many rules do I want how many columns

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,920
you want

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,679
where do I want to start my website what

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,769
should my users see when they first go

00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,689
to my website when you plan that only

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:52,319
then should start building your website

00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:55,350
using your design morning colors then

00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:57,929
the easiest and fun breath is dragging

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,629
and dropping your elucidates so

00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:04,009
basically if you want to put a contact

00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:07,019
form or if you want to do it over the

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:11,339
background or a picture that's where you

00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:14,970
start doing it so some of the big

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:18,869
leaders have predefined box since this

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,459
one asked so what you can do is you know

00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:24,110
what maybe you don't want an entire

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:27,470
layout or you don't want an entire

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:30,420
website you just want one part of your

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,639
the effect you look like this in that

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,689
case you will have certain blocks which

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,629
is demonios

00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:39,299
or you're practicing you can just put it

00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:40,339
right here on your website that we

00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,199
normally have

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,240
to be able to customize the other

00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,480
options of other sections of your

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,370
website but then the smart birds are the

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,410
easy parts first approach we would want

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:56,660
to invest a lot of time didn't you in

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:59,629
the stools the beautiful box if you are

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,089
not billing for that or if you want just

00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:04,339
a given layer that you can personalize

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,879
then months of the warehouses for me to

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,949
go

00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,040
most of these wonders they will have

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:11,839
they are so specific to your niche so

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,499
first when they're thinking of your

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,930
website find your niche that I'm going

00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:20,089
to appeal to this crowd that way you

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:23,149
will be able to do the website that will

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:27,019
be helpful for someone who's going to

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:31,910
visit your website suppose you want to

00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:34,519
do this magazine so what you want to do

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,740
the spy website or you want to build a

00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,070
new website what does your Joomla

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,890
website actually cater it

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,290
focus on what's the best part of your

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:48,550
gym when you are building a niche

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,320
specific niches with specific layout you

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:54,160
can choose that from your beach burger

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:59,410
so you can just export or import your

00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,750
layouts and start building let's say you

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,350
might question that if I'm using are

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,360
they out

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,600
it might look similar to someone who's

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,910
using the signal that's not really the

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,220
case because you can also customize for

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,410
example when you're giving pictures you

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,990
can insert new pictures in your layouts

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,810
you can drag another you can actually

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,720
customize every aspect of your website

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,840
using a fish learner what it only does

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,340
is make is make things easier for you

00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,920
and obviously some people who think that

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,630
it's laggy or slow and in that case do

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,670
your research because when you do your

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,870
research you will find products because

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:44,020
there are so many and are extremely fast

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:46,240
so there is an adult for everything you

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,460
need for example you know contact form

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,000
or you need a periscope or you want to

00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,470
put Instagram on your website want to

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,300
interlink it but you don't know how

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,950
because you're just new to coding on you

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,950
make Instagram servers connect with

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,700
servers in that case for every of this

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,800
of options there is an apple and you

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:10,310
have the option to utilize your atom to

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,400
the maximum because when you have so

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,950
many add-ons it not only helps make your

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,080
website look richer it shows that you

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,850
are richer content on your website but

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,530
it also shows that you put a lot of

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,350
thought when you're building your

00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,660
website and the best part is you're

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,460
doing it for so much less time than you

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,970
would necessarily do if you were

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:35,450
recording so reusable design suppose I

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:39,500
get a website that has a row there and

00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:42,320
we need up how to use how to do that so

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,330
there is a library you can save all your

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,730
designs in the library you means paper

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,070
an entire website you can say you can

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,790
save an unfinished great music thinner

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:55,700
so that's the thing sometimes a lot of

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,950
custom started within your websites that

00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,070
we stopped having me and we never go

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,870
back to it because of some reasons but

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,730
you can always go back to your own

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,830
designs if you're building another

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,440
website you can also use those same

00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,450
designs when using the same ones

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,920
we'll have to put that much effort again

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:18,830
from the start so how big the most of

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,900
your BS burners first strike viewers

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,090
when you're doing your research most of

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,070
the big leaders have a three worst if

00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,110
there's a few mercenary field now they

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,480
use the page builder before trial

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,670
finished occurs when you try the free

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,590
version you're able to see but you can

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,140
actually get all right even if you're

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,090
missing you to this if you are able to

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,370
deal with the beach if this is for you

00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,860
or if this is a waste of time for you

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,740
you need to try the free version first

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,590
and check for SQL support suppose there

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,690
are integrated things and say your page

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,700
where you get three tips does that

00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,820
support SEO will it improve their

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,730
security have talked with the support

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,890
when you're investing on a page whether

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,990
you will get information from the

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,939
support group a lot you can ask them

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,370
what kind of things you again how much

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:11,829
you can customize know your page builder

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:15,620
first before investing in it and save me

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:17,600
firstly we need to understand that you

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,620
need sometimes you buy a lot of page

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,510
builders that have a lot of

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,650
functionality but we don't necessarily

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,949
need it

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,750
so why invest very expensive page

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,830
builder if you know me this so first

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,040
panel should be

00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:33,620
other things I want to say these are the

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,020
goals for website and then align the

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,350
requirements and choose the best page

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,240
under that you can get so now that we

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,610
have a pretty much to render the basics

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,800
of how you can use a page builder or how

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:51,170
to make the best of three children

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:55,100
let's talk about music now there so on

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:56,450
the actual Gutenberg because there have

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,390
been a lot of speculations regarding

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:02,990
November I think that supposed to

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,880
release this nineteen so others

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,160
intimates completely release it is the

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,700
elaboration of it we cannot be sure or

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,350
very expected from women but some of the

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,020
basics of admission from booting with

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:17,000
them because see when I'm coming from a

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,310
user perspective they just learn workers

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,320
they just learn how to use the

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,180
dispositor but now there's the new

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,830
editors for Moodle brain animal is gone

00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,779
crazy body and they don't know anything

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,340
because

00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:31,179
corners and not from this immunity

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,580
hardly want to deal with it so there are

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,349
some basics of good lyric that means so

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,139
many costs that person erotic Worcester

00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:39,639
on would reverses being endorsed I went

00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:43,059
to effects these leaders and the

00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:43,570
competitors are not so remember what I'm

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,269
talking about

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,009
written word for now it's not a base

00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:51,129
will remain in the future maybe in the

00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:53,830
future it will replace to dr. Goodman to

00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:57,460
replace speech learners but right now

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,989
government is not a beige book so we

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,119
cannot expect the same sort of

00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:02,739
functionality we cannot refer someone

00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,229
can have the same sort of functionality

00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:09,279
with butter or burn that pick them they

00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:11,589
would get at these rumors however if you

00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,330
so they want your website to focus on

00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:17,139
blogging and if it's a very much

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,239
content-based from website you know

00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:21,249
necessarily means face values in that

00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:23,559
case you could have done it with the

00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:26,710
report but usually

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,289
that's much easier so what moving work

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,600
for now focuses on is to improve the

00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:33,999
content because I think that was

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,759
necessarily because with the kind of

00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:39,730
websites that we have right now using

00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:42,399
work quarters alone was not satisfactory

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,559
so Gutenberg is that step to go where

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:47,249
they would be able to at least start

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,720
with completely with the modern websites

00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:53,679
it's just one - the default WordPress

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,629
editor so when you're starting the

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,399
Gutenberg journey you need to understand

00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:59,889
that there will be a chain there will be

00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:02,799
changes but you also think there is not

00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:04,809
a lot of things to learn in fact it's

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,999
much easier in class if you have some

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:09,369
knowledge with each builders you would

00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:14,350
good where would be very easy for you to

00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:18,220
understand so very example overview on

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:20,889
how to use Moodle glossary

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:24,820
I talked about blocks in page builders

00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:29,019
and we boxer just a part of page boogers

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:34,889
sometimes they're not Gutenberg blocks

00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:37,929
are everything so if were ever like

00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:40,240
frustrated with how you put the titles

00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:43,149
and sometimes like you have problems

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,279
with how the sizes differ as apparently

00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:46,840
that's a big deal for me because I don't

00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,749
necessarily always want to change it to

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,309
mean something or anything like that

00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:55,600
so whatever blocks dogs are always

00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,940
because there that she will do so much

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,220
customization you don't necessarily need

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,840
to understand to have a basic

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,179
understanding of purpose because the

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,470
functions are pretty self-explanatory

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:08,019
there's a block for putting your content

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:12,610
and you can just do that according that

00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:13,960
there is it however you like so that is

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:18,279
something that would not be something

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:21,490
that is not yet activated in all aspects

00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,619
but from what we gather is that they

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,649
would there is what we are driving that

00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:30,100
option for every aspect of wouldn't

00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:31,869
break in the future images now this is

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,240
something that is that this am

00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:36,830
personally happy

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,779
we never write something in resurrector

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,340
images i want to know how my images look

00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:45,210
if you have every reason across one

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,460
media it's so much easier like you can

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,289
just approach the content and then you

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,309
can just see how it looks

00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:55,049
even the basement as well the best

00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:58,500
aspects as you can see how it looks like

00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:02,429
visual entry so when you're placing this

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:06,029
box we reveal an idea of our content

00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:07,890
window so images are being as big

00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:10,470
despite that you just choose your image

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:14,330
and you don't have to like shift every

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,330
time you add an image to your continent

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,870
another thing our widgets and other

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,090
features of Wittenberg so there are

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,360
three broad based business right now

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:27,539
one is chart a category so when we are

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,919
building Abraxas it's content-based your

00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:34,590
contents which would show these three so

00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,390
when users got your website they would

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,390
be able to see what your name is most

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,270
trying they can add and if you see her

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,460
categories and even

00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,590
remember lets you add third-party

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,200
widgets so that makes the process so

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:51,130
much easier because just after images

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,640
and your dog would feel your blood would

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:57,130
feel more complete now there are certain

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,660
they are an additional user there's the

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:04,030
more element so it's very much it helps

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:08,679
you limit how much you want your reader

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:11,830
to see so suppose I want an excerpt that

00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,230
I don't want to show the entire block or

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,150
strainer so I can use the more category

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,300
after at this only test I can limit that

00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:21,610
this is the amount you want them to see

00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,040
their hosts the spacer layouts that you

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,290
have put between your paragraphs and you

00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,150
can drag and drop it when you try to

00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,059
draw medical truth first of all is how

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,980
much space no one between your errors

00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:36,040
now text columns there are two versions

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,700
of text columns right now one index form

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,640
that you choose the size of the

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,500
basic text though you have four

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,530
scientist right now small alerts and

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,800
medium extra hearts of text problems and

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:52,350
then there is follows meet Nikita is the

00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,570
experimental man there you get a lot of

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:57,210
options and even the menu for the

00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,460
country to understand to be different so

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,740
the common visa would help you choose

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,490
the color it has a work in with

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,490
customization option you have the option

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,650
to choose colors you have watch them to

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,750
choose sizes you can choose the

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,460
background courage so there are a lot of

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:19,400
things that are going to promise beta

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:24,060
that is still an experimental version so

00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:28,890
right now base runner is not right now

00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:31,560
if there is not good competitively base

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:34,440
runners but you can use bones you can

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:37,290
use both right now because you can edit

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,380
with Guttenberg and then start building

00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,020
a page with page builders so what you're

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,180
getting is amazing content from

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,640
Guttenberg you can place your paragraphs

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,620
are when you like practice blog post are

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,919
part of your website you're getting that

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,019
and the same thing

00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:58,629
the design and functionality of a

00:24:53,019 --> 00:25:00,759
jewelers so before I end from our

00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:03,820
visitor or from someone who's in the

00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:07,389
resistive element we want to understand

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,710
how your website looks so these are some

00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:09,880
of the tips and tricks that you can you

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,330
should

00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,030
the website when you using our website

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,850
for businesses it's more important that

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,810
you place on what crescent orange itself

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:25,510
workers comp they have problem anymore

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:28,480
then do your research do your research

00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:29,980
because it's important whatever like I

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,370
said whatever needs to be your

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:36,580
supporting what kind of knows what kind

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,500
of targets that you used so it's

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,420
important because you don't want the

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:44,440
Arab sector more clumsy or that it's not

00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:49,750
plan lastly be careful be careful with

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:52,110
your chakras your soft words are should

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,450
be organized it shouldn't be messy and

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:59,080
don't overcrowd represented but you

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:01,360
don't want to visitors to get lost or

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,690
get confused when they're visiting your

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,780
website because we know about your page

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,660
with plugins sometimes you might be

00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,420
but important information for something

00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,190
that you want to highlight but they're

00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,140
not seeing it because there's too much

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,030
information you understand when you

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:22,350
disappear most jurors and they only give

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:24,720
you a chance of a few seconds to see if

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,910
you're upset you know so you want that

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,920
kind of attention from them you won't be

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:33,030
able to do that you're overcrowding

00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:36,600
you're upset but the responsiveness a

00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:40,110
lot of your users would go to your site

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,600
from different devices so choose a page

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,570
leader on track or always really you're

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,790
choosing you're making your website

00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:52,410
see if it's responsive across all

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:55,350
browsers and across all devices there is

00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,060
an adoption of security and first

00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,820
impression should have the graphics of

00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,950
first official person person and at

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,320
least keep your website updated because

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,850
when you're upset is updated users we

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,340
know that you're making conscious effort

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,280
to make your nursing matter speed you

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,920
you want must be neither said you

00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,380
you won't get users if they're visiting

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,960
your estate in a lot of time to go

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,240
and lastly collect your site with Google

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,000
Analytics because you're supporting a

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,010
service important and lastly quotes

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,310
don't define your website you don't have

00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:31,260
to be an amazing order to me to want to

00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:34,610
have an amazing website to start

00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,610
somewhere in your research

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,109
