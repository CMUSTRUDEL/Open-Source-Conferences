good morning everyone summit a nice one

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,910
I was actually planning on doing this in

00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:18,900
person are you but because I come all

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,789
the way from Samba so my my dialect max

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:27,210
over direct might not know you will hear

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,680
so I'll stick to money our English if

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,449
you have any questions and you would

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,739
like to ask me Emily

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:39,600
even in this on stage please feel free

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:43,739
outside right let's stop a little bit

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:52,770
about myself this year should be my 20th

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:56,760
anniversary of doing this actually my

00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,899
first among everything after my kids the

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,510
web is the best I don't know why because

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,140
I can do anything on it I can solve

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,709
anything on well I can search and learn

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,920
everything so it has stuck with me for a

00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:18,959
long time and in WordPress came into my

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,679
life about 10 years ago I I was trying

00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:26,849
to build my own blog and not rely on any

00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:32,819
other third party daughter and I'm a

00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:33,929
self-taught program who you can go yes

00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:42,990
very good very good

00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:45,840
who here does not code with pH ok I'll

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,840
be talking a lot of in HP I have

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,109
background

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,789
you know jet s which is server-side

00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:56,770
JavaScript but if you ask me a little

00:01:54,789 --> 00:02:02,829
bit on my phone but do not ask me

00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:05,860
everything on movie any reference to

00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:07,390
because here will be reference based on

00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:12,580
PhD standards

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:15,970
I've been herself I taught myself

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:20,250
programming but actually I did end up

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:23,530
having a first job as an agnostic so

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,730
there's a lot of things I love about

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,590
WordPress but most of all it's the

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,349
plug-and-play

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:38,019
factor it comes in I didn't realize that

00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:40,660
at that time WordPress would become one

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,750
of the most powerful tool that you can

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:52,180
use if you want to improve your search

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:56,470
engine optimization so it also has a

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,200
very high potential for you as a non-pro

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:04,540
pregnant but like to go into technical

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:11,200
things and learn WordPress would be a

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:14,650
very easygoing time this is a snapshot

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,680
of my profile at WordPress top quality

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:22,280
so as you can see I I built two

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,370
this which taiko stood in more festive

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,579
party I'd like to call myself as welcome

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,819
back and develop the rather than a full

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:36,650
stack of front-end developer because

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:38,810
design-wise I importance cannot design

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,810
if you want to be the combine the best

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,109
colors distant that or whatever images

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,840
I'm hopeless but if you want me to

00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:50,540
optimize your website make it faster I

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,760
came talking with and love debugging and

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:58,540
connect sorry I also actually contribute

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,090
to WordPress technology India

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,560
translation from English Nubian so if

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,920
you are losing the press apology

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,849
translation the Fox files to create

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:17,810
websites that actually uses text in

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:20,810
Malay so I'm kind of team I hope

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,419
tomorrow when I hope tomorrow you join

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,310
the contribute contribute today but I

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,620
won't be there because I had to do

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,630
believe but this joining they want to do

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,780
today because one of the things that we

00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,530
need help with is the translation from

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,530
English

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,760
right a lot of these things you actually

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:48,210
can learn from Google's life are you

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,790
always that back and forth going through

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,790
what press developer miss was last time

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,639
WordPress developer resources was known

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,070
as the WordPress context for those of

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,740
you who have worked on WordPress was a

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,930
long time they renamed it recently so

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,449
they have that a developer resource and

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,290
then they have the team resources if you

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,870
wanna learn how to get started the

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,389
resources section has been improved lots

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,850
so there's a lot of tutorial there you

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:23,220
can even find video tutorials on how to

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:28,940
start creating your first theme so

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:32,150
actual fact is you only need two files

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:36,870
today we will be learning three files I

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:44,639
say as simple and using three parts

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:49,380
because it's not HP so it plays a big

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,729
factor in kind of simplifying your work

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,180
asset available

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,039
okay the simple theme that I mentioned

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,080
in my title is actually a quick back

00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,849
title it's not really simple the

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,990
creative is really simple

00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:06,320
yes in a way it is but after that it

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,910
takes a lot of your right brain to work

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,729
anyway going back to this you will

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,870
notice that you need only two files

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:18,990
which is one PHP file and one style

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:24,030
sheet right CSS file that's all you need

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:26,479
the CSL CSS file even though practically

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:31,789
if you want to build a one page

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:34,870
WordPress you can however in terms of

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:38,150
reading the

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,100
the things like what is the name of this

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,760
team what is the description of this

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,000
team

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,670
what is the screenshot and policies you

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,940
will meet with me the Styles not CSS

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:53,720
style box yes we need to put all this

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:58,040
metadata in Sector so you cannot escape

00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:02,750
from having a separate CSS and PHP I

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:05,570
mentioned this because if later on you

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,560
follow year another track for

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,500
progressive web apps and even if you are

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,510
learning about another web technology

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,770
called

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:21,880
accelerated mobile pages M you will

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,500
notice that the standards now is that

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,970
you need to combine all these JavaScript

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:32,750
files CSS files and whatever HTML as a

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:36,140
it because that you have there that was

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:39,830
the what what's recommended by these

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,860
standards for empty and in progressive

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:47,180
web apps tree there are benefits to

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:50,960
combining your files one of it would be

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,360
if you are a web developer now and you

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,830
are struggling to develop how to build

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,890
mobile apps that would make your

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,020
transition from a web developer into a

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:07,970
mobile applicant and easy

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:11,690
who here is struggling who is suku he is

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:16,880
still trying to build your first mobile

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:20,180
app and is still struggling how how's

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,560
the technology is the same the way you

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:28,230
build an app versus the way

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:31,530
the website it's totally crazy it's like

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:34,860
in you you learn something different so

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:38,340
if you is a web developer actually felt

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,810
better frustrated and it's not like all

00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,140
these many years of learning web

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:48,380
development is now mobile mobile

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:52,680
development is a trend and however

00:08:48,380 --> 00:09:00,240
thankfully with the new technologies

00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:01,470
like ionic wear and other hybrid because

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,339
hi Victor

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:11,460
you can actually now build apps using

00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:13,529
HTML CSS and JavaScript hopefully

00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,070
whatever that you learn now is more

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:21,870
portable you cannot it cannot run away

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:25,050
from development it's actually if you

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,510
look at market trend for web developer

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,630
the demand for web developers in the job

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,460
market it's actually going down going

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:36,120
down I cannot show you the statistics

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:41,120
but it's exactly from Google and that

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,320
was in 2015 so it's definitely going

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,880
downwards continuously

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,820
so once you learn how to combine all

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:55,220
your PHP files CSS file and even just a

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:57,570
class you should be able to move over to

00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:03,810
you can talk about it on in the

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:07,770
happiness the examples that are gonna

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:10,140
show would be three files of course the

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:13,800
standard and most recommended way of

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,440
building page WordPress themes would be

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,040
in the modular way the means of

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,940
separating header is a footer separating

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,790
archives

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:30,520
separately single post and so

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:34,390
why it's email in a way in the long-term

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:37,830
what's talked to us is that it's going

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:42,670
to be easy for developers to and it

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:46,570
changed so the conflicts will be less

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:50,920
when we have more about us I mean in the

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:53,610
long term but truthfully truthfully for

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,470
people like myself as freelancers of

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,780
solopreneurs who built it up who

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,930
developed websites by ourselves and we

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:05,950
don't have any other partners partner

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:09,580
developers you know our stuff you build

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:13,620
your stuff and to to have to manage so

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:17,890
many positive very very cumbersome and

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:21,370
tracking it would be big bother unless

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:24,250
you do a lot of kit or do a lot of

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,650
version music saturation and silky so

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,940
that would be easy and if you are

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,820
already using

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,740
that means the conflict files if people

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,170
are working on single file different

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,040
people when they commit to that file and

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,600
push a new update the chances of topic

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,500
is even less

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:48,400
so I not just stick to one file make our

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:51,850
life easier and in terms of self be

00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:55,060
bugging you later on in case you develop

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,350
this kind of themes across them and then

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,470
the customization

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:07,090
in bugging this one itself can you teach

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:09,370
me how to do that I know so that so so

00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:12,310
there the challenge would be less on

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,310
telling them oh go find your file under

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,950
this folder in that folder and that file

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:21,550
and you see all this love will stop

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,620
because you don't have that strongly

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:28,030
just tell them to go oh you have this

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:35,620
one sympathy HP power index open and

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:42,730
straw so it's easy for you if you want

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:45,730
to transfer your knowledge the use case

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,930
here will be the normal and it's the

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,840
kind of websites that we're building

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,120
would be very suitable for the normal

00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:58,990
web sites that content based websites

00:12:52,120 --> 00:13:02,890
news but if you're talking about CMS

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:07,630
system in terms of making it or

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:11,890
transform it into a web app that'll be a

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:15,850
different story may have to add some eh

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:18,940
people use a lot more luggage than you

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,040
suppose I love bunnies and nothing

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:25,570
against targets and nothing against page

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:29,050
builders but the early when you use new

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:32,610
plugins and more page builders slower

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:37,390
than your work site becomes that's

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:39,910
that's a no-brainer so the use case here

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,860
is that we want to page maybe just one

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,520
page when they look they can go and

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:50,550
scroll down when the page

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:53,280
have that normal Jumbotron a call to

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:57,300
action section then followed by some

00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:01,620
pages static information and then your

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:04,050
posts and then the button will be your

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,630
written that's the kind of simple

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,790
one-page material that you might make as

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,730
a website that's very simple for

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:16,290
marketing purposes and for collecting

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:19,410
for collecting to promote your products

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:23,550
in a one-page simple so you can be use

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,350
this and maybe try and make it go faster

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:29,840
in yourself start you're gonna show them

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:34,170
really fast as well website simple as

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:37,790
hopefully this will this is the

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:40,700
functions functions the PHP file I use

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:48,300
for this theme

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:53,060
that's why I use someone that's why the

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:58,080
key here to make your theme simple is

00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:02,780
first used a lot of city-nets content

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:07,250
delivery network take advantage of those

00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:08,820
that means if you have Java scripts and

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,030
CSS files

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,610
try not to how post it together with

00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:20,640
your team don't play together instead

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:23,300
instead link it to the built in how can

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,920
the built in strict that WordPress has

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:29,580
you know what press has no constraints

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,579
now you don't actually for example if

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,779
you're using jQuery specifically

00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,119
you don't actually have to put the

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,459
jQuery together in your themes you know

00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:43,199
when we create things we package a lot

00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:46,959
of things they're your images just get a

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:51,159
CSS file instead of doing them why not

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:55,629
just specify the functions file and then

00:15:51,159 --> 00:16:00,639
grab those things from the built in

00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:07,139
WordPress page of the WordPress core or

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:10,629
link it to a CD game of your choice so

00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:13,419
default scripts that are listed that

00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:16,329
come not together with WordPress they

00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:19,659
actually listed is up in the WordPress

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:25,149
who develop develop a resource so you

00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:27,699
can actually search for things or strips

00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:34,029
that you can run and you don't have to

00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:36,659
put it into your theme it's just the

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:41,279
problem with this would be for example

00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:47,109
the thing that I've got bill uses

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:52,149
bootstrap bootstrap has its own J's file

00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:57,999
on top of using jQuery facts so how do I

00:16:52,149 --> 00:17:04,329
insert those things into my theme when

00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:06,730
it's not built into the press yes that's

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:11,649
where the functions PHP can see so you

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:14,860
need to define and register that CSS or

00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:21,389
just fire into the function functions

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:24,929
file register and implement into your P

00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:29,889
but this is the code that you use

00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:30,430
whenever there is a non-existing or no

00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:36,450
bill

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:46,060
into js5 in wordpress you use registers

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:48,870
and find what CDM also your your JS

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,240
files CSS files we just looking for it

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:55,420
maybe just find a bootstrap whoops let

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,120
me see the anything new you will be ill

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,790
give you a list other things or other

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,820
CSS files or just as that you can be

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:06,220
concert with will be false if you have

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,650
specialized a customized fonts you need

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,230
to use this you need to create into your

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,920
functions file register it before you

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:17,980
cure you always need to queue it so that

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:22,210
it does not conflict any other plugins

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:24,850
that uses the same yes it will not love

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,030
multiple answer everything best

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:32,580
practices put it in your functions of

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,580
which you do not have common utilities

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:42,760
this is how I do my bootstrap and my

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,720
jQuery for bootstrap because it's not

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,990
built in to address that therefore I

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,660
just in case bootstrap is being used as

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:57,850
the name of being defined somewhere I

00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:00,550
have to be registered in and it started

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,020
to my work starts with an is at me that

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:07,080
not isn't because I would make sure that

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,989
these CSS and yes

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:14,549
is only noted for my sight and not into

00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:17,580
administration or your desk or and

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,619
otherwise your dashboard because certain

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,529
CS as fast as its own fault

00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:26,369
it will also overwrite your dashboard

00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:29,690
once so it looks behind it will be

00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:35,100
registered and then priminister it back

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:38,909
what I want to highlight here is the

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:43,169
difference between the style and script

00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:48,299
you notice that I have two files one is

00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:51,149
top CSS and J's with the dog GS style

00:19:48,299 --> 00:20:05,179
when I register it you will notice any

00:19:51,149 --> 00:20:05,179
extra lines up here this is the register

00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:10,529
this is how you define it there are a

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:15,679
few arguments me that I'll use

00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:20,039
specifically whenever I put in J's files

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:25,109
specifically you need the last one the

00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:28,320
true argument here refers to whether or

00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:34,919
not I want to put that script in the

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:40,470
footer of my website of my team why I

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:44,309
use this is due to page it's recommended

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,889
that any CSS files that you have you

00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:50,879
must put it on top in your header in

00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:56,429
your meta tags before your body of HTML

00:20:50,879 --> 00:21:00,239
CSS only that is the reason why certain

00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:09,029
sites load really slowly is because you

00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:12,539
have both CSS and Java Java so if you

00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:16,109
see any themes of plugins take a look at

00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:19,259
how they call the JavaScript decoding in

00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:22,470
the header of does it appear at the

00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,899
bottom that's how one of them that's one

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,269
of the ways for you to speed up or

00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:32,429
optimize your website make sure your Jay

00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:35,309
has asked all appear and right before

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:39,049
the closing of the border so this is why

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,049
again it's

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:52,940
and Jake really book the bootstrap theme

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:58,100
that I use users is dependent on Jake

00:21:52,940 --> 00:22:01,040
wheel so because jQuery is already built

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,490
into the themes so I don't have to worry

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:08,450
about calling any ecdm I'm just gonna

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,370
use this is that this is one thing that

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,070
we need to be careful of project really

00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:16,690
because if you realize you have a script

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:20,330
and then that JavaScript updates itself

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:23,690
but you're certain targets of certain

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:26,720
things that you use uses a mobile

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:29,780
version and all those interactive that

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,110
you need to be careful and that is where

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:38,890
again back to functions of HP you need

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:43,640
to define the exact version of your test

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:45,920
that you also need to this is a very

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,720
good pitch that's why we cannot run I

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,930
prefer not to run away from touching

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,930
stuff

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,630
that's about it

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,649
this is a Devilfish that I created there

00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:15,029
might be some bug's here I have not

00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:16,139
really debug everything yet but the idea

00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:20,249
is like this

00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:23,220
this is based on the team example in

00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:29,090
good tracfone so I just copied pasted

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:29,090
make it change some of the codes inside

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,759
[Music]

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:44,369
but this is how it looks like so when

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,940
you click on review so when you click on

00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:51,450
do it actually loads the same page again

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:53,940
but then it did step a single page so

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:58,980
what happens here when you look at the

00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:01,230
themes is that whatever content you if

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,480
you are trying to change the an existing

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,100
theme and trying to practice yeah if you

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,139
download a certain even if you want to

00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,779
try to make it one page you look at

00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:12,690
there then the cops and the pages that

00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:15,029
comes with it so for example the index

00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,070
page will stick like that and then when

00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:19,139
you go to the skin blond or PHP path

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,499
there are certainly paths that you can

00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:28,289
just copy paste and to your existing

00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:32,960
index dot PHP and PHP and then make make

00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:32,960
a an F statement like I think

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:50,080
so when you do that you have to be an if

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:53,220
statement for that spell so whenever it

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,159
goes to when it whenever it calls a

00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:00,159
single-page check for whether it's a

00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:04,690
single base if it calls for an archive

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,740
by month for my category category and so

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:11,980
on and so forth it's very simple picture

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:15,850
then just do the necessary in case that

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:18,580
whatever constant in that's how you do

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:25,690
will see the page another way to make it

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:34,500
even better is if you do a it's not lazy

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:39,929
though but you just use Ajax maybe after

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,929
injects means a synchronous JavaScript

00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:53,740
something XML and XML what it does is

00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:57,399
actually a synchronously know your page

00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:01,450
when you click more button so instead of

00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:03,430
loading that page again as usual you

00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,850
just use JavaScript in

00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:12,130
or any other framework to learn it

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:14,350
continuously you know or if you're using

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:18,970
bootstrap and if they click on the

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:22,900
single page a single post it actually

00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:26,440
opens them more Doudna like a modular

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:29,140
form on top of your list so there's a

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,830
lot of ways creative ways that you you

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:39,940
can do with a single page in it's just

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:42,730
that how much and how how willing you

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:46,630
have to go further to play around with

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:49,090
this activates the the the limitations

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,340
the restrictions that I put on that

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:58,950
single page will push you into the name

00:26:51,340 --> 00:27:04,210
you were delivering so before I end

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:06,610
again the news piece here if you're

00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:10,360
planning on building an e-commerce site

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:14,230
it might work it might not but again I

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:18,240
always mentioned it's your pivot is your

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:26,980
name if you know a way to make an app

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:30,100
then using a single page and the the

00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:36,210
potential for a single app would be that

00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:40,840
if you are ready to go into the trend of

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:44,560
headless handless CMS everyone up head

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:49,240
to CMS people behind the CMS the concept

00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:52,060
is 50 you don't have to have your admin

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,860
page on your desk phones or anything you

00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,830
can customize

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,720
and just use what press gave me ice in

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,620
the doctor basis will be still depressed

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,840
and a condom and in the scheme the Husky

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:07,080
will still be wordpress but the way you

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,929
called it would be using the AVIC step

00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,500
so that's one of the ways you can play

00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:19,529
around so that you can build in mobile

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:22,100
app version of your website thank you

00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:22,100
