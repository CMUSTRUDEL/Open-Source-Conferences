whoever means and they need a director

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,300

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,040
almost like 10,000 word article

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,620
I am sure they shortly about length for

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,140
quite hot every day and how what rest

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,170
help me actually decide that end of our

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:52,220
I am still a great adjusting decision to

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:57,100
be get in the middle of my career today

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,100
we are going to talk about water fitness

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,380
so as you have already answered in

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,740
waters business we are mainly

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:09,300
concentrating on that product is

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:11,700
like bunny powerlifting and we are going

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,500
to we will not actually talk not about

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,410
service business or if you're actually

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:23,570
building for your clients into the

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:26,370
session we are doing focus more on so

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,550
certainly there are many of you already

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,310
started what the business of building so

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:36,840
what if you have not let go wasn't easy

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:40,980
so something to keep you good answer

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,440
like who do we consider when any of you

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:50,370
consider yourself at that you're

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:54,420
successful in what has been an event

00:03:50,370 --> 00:04:00,960
planning business or take any of you are

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:03,030
doing in applying business hopefully

00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,310
like into this session I will be able to

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,590
add some of the information that we are

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,270
doing for our homelessness that any

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,370
cookie would relate to it so those of

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,280
the word actually just get introduced to

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,600
oppressed or don't have that mass of the

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,930
idea how this works

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,210
what this is Fiedler's I think a few

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,630
months ago we have cross like 33 percent

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,470
of our entire world obedience so right

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,860
now

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:36,960
mostly over 33% of the entire web

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:40,470
accessibility Northwest and horses may

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,530
be available in you know even consider

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,980
like e-commerce business only Obama's

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:50,820
powers 39% of the entangled without

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:54,210
ecommerce so obviously boombox is also

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,940
an open-source platform and if the

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,890
destined data taken from you it that

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,690
that gives a lot of their like Howard's

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,390
that are will between students and he

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,870
says over 1.5 million in commercial

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:09,330
centers built using over owners so what

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,940
accessibility and if you look at the our

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,100
plugin growth that is understand like

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,180
how many plugins are submitted in

00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,060
daughter Reggie

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:22,770
every year you see like every year it

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:25,980
will always dream so if in 2014 if you

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,650
have like one 42 three 42 new target

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,820
it actually proved a lot higher in 2014

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,950
so this dinner a little bit later about

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,710
October 2015

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:40,530
but I think I need a screen readers even

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,660
do a lot more so right now we are the

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,260
gaining more user and more plugins are

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,669
coming in those are some of the data

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,880
about cold Canyon

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:55,040
okay how many of you have any plugins

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,040
are things in 4k

00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:01,169
so in court Canyon they can review

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,300
process now and then you submit a news

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,250
item so those are some of the stats like

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,229
how their business and number of what

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,349
responding is going as if you still it

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:13,620
in this it is up to 2006 the end of 2016

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:15,810
so people are submitting more and more

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,490
clients and everywhere that means the

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:23,460
business is growing successful business

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,800
yet if we do the Abrams actually talked

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,990
more about like a business how people

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,330
start a business important warship or

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,669
not enormously

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,800
those are like basically steps like you

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,229
probably start as a solo developer you

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,150
charge that will build something then if

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,819
you find some growth you will scale

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:45,590
expand that maybe you will be diplomatic

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,349
leader that's the normal business cycle

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,509
those are the some of the successful

00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:53,729
business they have like hundreds of

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:56,069
these extremely successfully addressed

00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:57,599
so that's some of the biggest name I

00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:59,039
think that most of you probably know

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,039
automatic the company behind

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,750
wordpress.com and also that will be

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:07,199
located at the cash including cotton

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:11,099
monster that lets me the option measure

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,400
in the company behind code Canyon used

00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:16,500
the everybody is it is the rubber like

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,900
if you were to sell something online

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,000
that's completely digital that that will

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:25,229
be your choice and I think one of the

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,360
oldest in business doesn't discount of

00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:29,819
any notable person inside what was the

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,629
ecosystem for very successful in

00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,909
business

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:36,539
DISA speaking minion is the co-founder

00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:39,779
of easy digital download that cyber key

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,800
he's behind automatic that's also the

00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,210
company behind the movie beginner and

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,770
optinmonster des Corey Miller the person

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:55,740
behind items and this year's the person

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:58,949
behind Houston a Steve Jordan dinner

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,580
business that is actually making over a

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:08,690
million dollar Anna there's a lot of

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,690
money do you think is easy

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:23,500
then how everything works later if

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,050
you're into business like I'm in

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,840
business for almost 30 15 years that

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,180
ended up if all the discussion is

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,430
recklessness are in business was easy

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,580
everybody would be in business so it's

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,169
not particularly and it's not envy but

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,550
at the same time obviously is possible

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:45,160
if you follow process so let's dig

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,380
deeper into land in business so in what

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,420
West who put the magnificent product and

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,240
service and today we're going to talk

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,880
more about product Sardis business could

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,740
be that web design your customizations

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,210
customer support maybe we are

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,410
maintaining somebody's website or

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:04,120
helping people stay at our product in

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,730
WordPress we would actually be vendor

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,150
providing the two ways is even with this

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,020
body

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,520
what this development supposed to be

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,150
established but somebody could actually

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,310
sell it as like difficulties as well so

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,890
it seems like they they will probably

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,450
just actually make some kind of website

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:27,820
for you and there's a pitch price and

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:30,280
they have a process to build it so we

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:36,630
are going to talk about also the pricing

00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:39,670
model and generally get inside contest I

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,890
personally prefer the premium order so

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,410
even had a flipper

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,090
that can be a little funny and then you

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,240
have electric and products so people

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,680
could actually try it out and love the

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,380
main things that you will get that if

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,200
you have a let free product is in you

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,230
give them access to the martini because

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
if you release your importa stop

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,880
diverting you have that easy access to

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,640
all the videos which are essentially

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,930
downloading from the Daugherty and that

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,550
also true for the team as well let me

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:16,530
share an interesting trend we are seeing

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:19,080
right now in him if you look at the door

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,480
technique a lot of daughter to him right

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,880
now have a premium version the smaller

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,820
three so the team absolutely totally

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,740
part opinion question is a body that's

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,050
the near strength so the business

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,260
strength in a lot like a if you look at

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,570
like add up to be Astra or oceanography

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,940
all of them they have a presence in dr.

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:42,270
G at that TV immersion is a funny

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,060
so as WordPress right now moves a lot

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:49,170
about like our music customizer and lot

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,000
of things need to be like a follow a

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,860
standard so this easier from the

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,870
eventually later recalled after head of

00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:01,080
team and add more functionalities

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:03,330
through the body and discussion we have

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,420
a lot among all of our such business

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,550
like if you should go to us or not

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,040
disaster the main benefit you will get

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,440
you can clear out business briefly it

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,480
will charge your tank per month so it's

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,070
easier for you

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,459
you're left in the loop you're like

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:23,010
Matthew Rand ray and there are a lot of

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,779
discussions if what this business goes

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,820
for let me see beer and making

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,860
open-source if they should actually go

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:34,170
for stuff and if the clients you like to

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:37,110
pay Aparna so I like the suit or not so

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,230
little mistake about like how workers

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:45,060
business generally works I'm still a

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,380
girl you start to solve the problem then

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,720
you have some idea

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,970
you build something by euro you try a

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,720
child out in the market you select how

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:59,570
that goes and he'll stop workers working

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,570
then Newton immediately try to go more

00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:06,980
obvious issues we start from your

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,630
intention to solve the problem I

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,940
generally don't see a business that is

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,220
run along that that he started purely to

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,350
make money if always has to be like

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,410
solving a problem if you look at all the

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,940
statistics in or press the it's not like

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,010
they don't have a computer they have a

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,500
strong competitor the main reason they

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,569
are still striving and like they're

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,519
doing really well is because they

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:30,720
started to solve a problem and that was

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,029
any problem to solve

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,940
so let's start with solving a problem

00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:41,310
not just our money it has to have the

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,990
intention to actually go beyond the

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:49,600
money money will come in

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:53,300
and as I explained like realizing it III

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,360
having a giving a lot of like more

00:12:53,300 --> 00:13:00,020
options actually taste the market

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,870
mister get more feedback and like even

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:06,590
it is true that if you released a very

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:09,470
good product entry and probabilistic

00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,750
people from some of the features people

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,480
could actually comment and beauty about

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,370
things but he knew get access to

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:21,680
millions of people who are already using

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:24,110
waters and for baited up like releasing

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:29,840
it into or to start over G you needed a

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:32,470
lot like in the accent reviews then you

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,180
could add more value so instead okay

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,850
start planning the opinion from the

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,520
beginning I will suggest when build a

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,230
complete product for free and have more

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,780
plans like kill people receive it well

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,330
then you add more values and opinion and

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,960
you will always keep it in both the free

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:53,240
intro explain like a V towards that if

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,100
you plan a product thinking about like

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,560
money an Indian version at the beginning

00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,010
maybe you swing down some of the new

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,150
features in the free one so when people

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,500
are getting started

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,450
maybe you always thought about letting

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,030
me pay you money but you have to realize

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,920
what a very large ecosystem vast

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,350
majority of the people is not going to

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,310
operate

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,680
ever and so that if you do not give the

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,720
full day of your own product to people

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:24,180
they will not handle actually use it so

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:27,870
please be on top of the free version as

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,780
a secret we do have to try to grow our

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:33,390
business instead of being either so we

00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,840
should try to have the free version

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,490
that's like when we probably used at the

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,320
same time that the membership should add

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:46,140
on top of that initiative like

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:49,140
prosthetic people from a teacher like

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,850
let's build on people's feedback what

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,160
kind of power that we that we mean even

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:57,510
also how they system is actually seeing

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,820
the product over all so let me give you

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,160
the some of the tips like how a business

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,370
could be successful or what are the main

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,840
theme so my first it's will be in have

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,170
to have been really good providers

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,060
patients keep it equal II start from the

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,670
origin description that is the

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,590
inter-regional file then if you have

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,160
learning pins in your website have a

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,990
like proper descriptions with like a

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,320
coily the project how it works like how

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:29,010
people are using it at some cases study

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:32,250
people organ immunity booster amusing

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,820
here and show people how your product

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,420
works in general

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:41,860
or add video it doesn't actually make

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:44,230
your website very heavy and the main

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,990
reason a wordpress business a successful

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,420
is because of the support you need to

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,940
keep reimbursable that I would insist to

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,370
give really good support to also your

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,900
free user in what was dr. routine each

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,760
and every product have a like product

00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,440
for Nestle in the expert people could

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,690
ask questions for free and they're your

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,820
free user but when you are building your

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,460
product you need to have some studies in

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,780
how you could actually give support and

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,090
how you will actually keep providing

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,220
support ongoing so some people are

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,470
starving in water products maybe instead

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,810
of focusing on one product that will

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,880
maybe camera and then we do become very

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,470
hard for them to provide someone you

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,450
will end up like having been review

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,150
simulator the people talking bad about

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,520
your product it will have real like

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:30,070
benefits when people are searching about

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,050
your product online so heavily studies

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:37,360
need to provide support and also provide

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:39,010
support to your user and we find out

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,400
that documentation is something that

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:47,440
could actually reduce your pain from

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:50,440
growing user mean so if you have good

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,900
documentation you will have typically do

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,580
this with the customer support papers so

00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,770
try to build a leg will follow

00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,020
documentation that that so people could

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,280
actually discover like what kind of

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,930
issues they are facing and they were

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,350
shocked

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,390
problem I'll also statistically if a few

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,670
section in your documentation so the

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,550
kind of support rigorous you are getting

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:17,550
in dot oversee or even your subbu ticket

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:20,250
the common questions you should be for

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,709
all the publishing in the FAQ so you do

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,510
not have actually deal with dosa I know

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,699
a lot of people do not want actually

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,750
such a likable to your like government

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:33,780
listen they also actually just come into

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:36,150
the chat or like issue is updated so you

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,850
answered the poll actually and you tell

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,770
them like if that considered is already

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,440
documented in the documentation so next

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,030
time you have some questions go to the

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,530
documentation pass and then he would

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,170
always ask us questions we Louis

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,830
provided so that you create really good

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:56,550
rapport and also like a lot our

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:59,070
chocolate for our website actually comes

00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,780
all the documentation so if the document

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,750
is is done well because that's a little

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,020
eroded you will get a really good

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,790
shopping in the documentation as way

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,920
some of the mistake people make is seem

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,080
like documentation and blogging is not

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,000
just thing so if you have a writer

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,700
content like lets you student writing

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,650
law and you ask them today right here

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,340
documentation that should be like

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:25,950
different approach so trying to deep

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,800
online to see like how the documentation

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:31,299
and normal blog is built-ins and do it

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,830
properly so people will actually

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:38,260
because in documented over 270 organism

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,600
in a block something we build up the

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,460
high acuity that we have like one or two

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,590
paragraph that we actually describe how

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:48,309
this is a good post or how these will be

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:50,649
solved in here to have a solution so get

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:55,840
right into the pot and show the solution

00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:58,029
and if I had any bit of success in

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,940
addressing I think that mainly because

00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:03,940
of content marketing I was important

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,610
from the from very beginning so how it

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,500
could help you so let us consider give

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:12,159
have built a really good product and

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,720
right now in in 2018 it will be very

00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,990
hard for you to find a unique problem

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,279
that nobody is are solved before so

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,779
appropriately Lena solves the problem

00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,340
that is actually being solved by a few

00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:23,460
other people in a complex four year

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,789
program making the process is similar

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,860
all the easier then how you let people

00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,539
know about the root solution we have

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,580
already released the body detour to our

00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,529
team so people could discover but any

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,610
people are not stretching for that so

00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:41,169
how do you promote so the promotion it

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,809
would be a lot of different things these

00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:46,960
filter the content Roth you could also

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,680
use the social media and I think also in

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,900
Malaysia

00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:56,260
Media is but the way it works the

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,360
witnessing is individual focus and have

00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,670
good mysticism content so you need to

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,890
produce good content and heavy steadily

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,190
to distribute the other producing

00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,330
content and distributing quantities like

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,730
this reduction we have each other and

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,830
disability oh very well so if you

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,720
produce the product but you do not have

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:17,860
a like distributed mission strategy

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:21,700
that's non-political so and I would also

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,590
suggest to use the lead conversion so if

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,170
somebody's coming into your site has

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,640
been able to do it at least the emails

00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,500
please we probably get back

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,760
or maybe provide some before or

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,730
something so you would have their

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,400
contacts and you will send them updates

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:42,970
about your product or maybe he can be a

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:46,720
new designer specific powers Center and

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,820
I would like to use like modern tools

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,130
for modeling so initiative like doing

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,750
all the scheduling or like in here

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,090
sharing in social media doing it

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,900
manually have like modern tools there

00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,050
are inseperable that you put it's really

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,840
neutralized

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,450
like like maybe most of your audience

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,360
are included and you are into actually

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,220
Martin here for

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,200
you seduce that actually give you more

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,770
insight about your future use of me and

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,840
try to automate some of the process and

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,310
experiment more and you need to have

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,400
like more data most of the modern

00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,430
marketing tools will be remain or on big

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,830
data and you need tips really like dig

00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:28,830
deeper and understand your strategy and

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:31,440
if you do not try few different know

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:36,360
that how you could actually do even

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:39,150
better interesting examples like how I

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,630
find using data to delete very useful

00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:46,080
I run quanta let me stand making images

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:51,120
in Bangor language it called the taka

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,550
time so our editor published one recipe

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,940
every day so we thought like maybe

00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,710
publishing Elizabeth during the

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,510
lunchtime school area so we thought like

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,320
maybe we should publish the recipient

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,180
2:30

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,360
because no matter the general laughs

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:08,490
that is to be a but later we some do

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,230
that we started sharing the Faustian

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,440
through our social media Facebook as

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,410
well

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,170
we have almost like 2.5 million fans in

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:20,280
facebook but then we thought about an

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:24,720
experiment so we try to do it as well we

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:28,020
start with solid living at 2:30 origami

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,410
star explaining it on like 2:30 to 1:30

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,750
and let for after testing and getting to

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,960
the later we find out like people want

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,760
to actually relate the recipe after they

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,580
have taken the last community our

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,340
calculation was maybe we should promote

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,600
the Arctic three for the last so maybe

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,990
it will

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,400
they will community and then able to

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,020
somewhere or ask their work that will be

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,210
the make something but he's actually

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,520
other allowed they have already there

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,860
now they must actually look at the hold

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,840
and legates maybe plan for something

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,820
tomorrow see if we have an experimental

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,500
I would have never thought it that

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,660
people often look at the hood picture

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,580
after they hunted Lance already so

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,200
experiment more look at the data maybe

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,400
you had something that you can report

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,920
our new for those of us out the resource

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,390
that all the waters businesspeople a

00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,580
very involved in business we should

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:27,150
actually follow regularly that he might

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,370
there are other product publication as

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,410
well there on the company that makes few

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,450
really good WordPress themes and plugins

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,950
but they write about that robot and

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,890
right here for the what was business a

00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,450
lot will start Rania's they are kind of

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,910
solution if you want to be in the

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,320
WordPress is the they will let you

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,930
publish it you could actually charge

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,730
your client they have a speaker so you

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,320
do not have to know any other like

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,960
e-commerce or something and they will

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,570
also let you calculate the text probably

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,080
do the licensing and everything now and

00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:01,840
manage that would be this let manage

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,180
tabular form and manage wrog manager

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,910
maintenance services many subtle because

00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,760
bob is one of the largest news source

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,710
for artists that will be beginners there

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,590
they look like I think most of you know

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:20,350
already because they're run for almost

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:23,530
nine years of ratings so now some of the

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:26,820
things like I had in to understand after

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:29,860
running business for over a decade

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,000
so if your idea is working if you are

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,670
already earning some money

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,600
people generally try to be in the

00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:40,270
company fast I would advise you to do

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,460
your team first if you know routine

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,530
the company the house or things you want

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,230
to be then we come for all of you ready

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,960
so instead of like focusing on company

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:52,330
like looking at the names or rests

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,620
trying to build a really solid team that

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,460
will actually going to to help you in

00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:59,620
the long run and business is a

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,570
continuous process so if you have your

00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,880
hemming like good self if you have let

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,260
good market share right now just mean

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,720
that you're going to have this forever

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,480
is a continuous process in always need

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,250
to actually chamber data see how a

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,750
recess more how you could actually

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,690
compare yourself with your partner's

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,970
competitors and how input actually

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,669
really improve if you do not follow the

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,460
process

00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,109
not keep building on top of it maybe we

00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,309
will not have the sensitive have right

00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:31,580
now so it's a continuous process and

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:34,070
sorry

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,570
some people are trying to take like if

00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:38,509
you build a really good product or

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:41,749
plugin of games it has a like market

00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:44,149
size already gaming even sit back and

00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,950
harmony there is actually nothing like

00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:48,230
people actually really sit back around

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,129
and you always have actually keep

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:54,379
walking on top of it

00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:56,749
ultimately bugging business or clean

00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:59,869
business or L mostly if anything you

00:25:56,749 --> 00:26:01,879
need Dorcas is a long game because that

00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:03,739
indicates three months to view the

00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:05,830
product maybe he knew take like three

00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:08,419
four months to actually just wrap up the

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,489
initial version and let get people's

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:12,769
feedback and restart that Indian version

00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:14,239
so ultimately so long game if you think

00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:16,940
that you could mean something if you

00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:20,059
want and make money out of it generally

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,210
is not going to work so you have to have

00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:30,200
any strategy to have a long time keep

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:32,779
building on top of it and so right now I

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,559
would really start the time for any

00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,559
