and I guess best to meet you guys my

00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,300
name is Gigi I have a lot to share today

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,030
about all the way to automate your

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,189
workflow on engaging your audience so

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm just going to give a brief I chose

00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:23,880
upset for myself so I'm if you know for

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,779
the tax I I'm a law graduate and then

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,180
right now I'm running

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,890
did you don't races you know okay so the

00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,420
first thing I'm going to do is to run

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,219
you guys through the topics that I'm

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,100
going to cover today so that we will

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,860
have a better flow on one quickly share

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,440
with you today so if this presentation

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,950
is actually really actionable so if you

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,210
have no left tops and

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:54,750
I have something you can get it out and

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,460
do some exercise okay so the first topic

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,950
they are going to talk about is why is

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,570
keeping your or yes engaging water and

00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,550
then we are going to look into the

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,619
traditional workflow and seen how we

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,939
used to create content and how we share

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,810
with our audience back both of us are

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,810
still doing it right now

00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:17,729
what kind of automation tools we can use

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,700
to automate some of our workflow so that

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,130
we can reuse repetitive flow and can

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,799
focus more on things that matters and

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,450
then after that we are going to redefine

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,090
the workflow you are going to look at

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:39,450
how people form looks like after we go

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:41,099
to meet so just to get discussions so

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,990
what is keeping our audience engaged

00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,899
important I believe that most of you

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,450
guys have many different reasons for it

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,509
but to us we like to think that it's

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,090
about remaining competitive in your own

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,219
industry and also it's about paying your

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,059
finances five I'm going to show you why

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,279
so trying to think of a bread that first

00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:02,939
stuck in your head when I say it's not

00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,829
four

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,810
so I appreciate you guys will think of

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:13,469
iPhone Samsung Shamim or are we and when

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:17,730
I mention CNS your thing on progress yes

00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:20,040
because I mean the it it happens because

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,950
these are the press that playing bits

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,519
and pieces in the life whether true as

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,709
you see in cinema or TV or radio or you

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,269
create somewhere it's just there because

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,890
it feels like part of life so the second

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,439
reason that I would like to encourage

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:41,609
the protocol Familia workflow is because

00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,969
it lowers your cost so prior to during

00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:47,609
this presentation that mighty magic

00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:50,579
research did a simple research for me so

00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:54,060
thank you to them they found that four

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:56,099
sources our business review of our

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,530
engine force and invest and she say that

00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,989
the cost of the crane and new customer

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,209
is five times as compared to retaining

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,790
and assist a client now I know some of

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,129
you guys might say what if I'm a website

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,560
gentleman company I mean most of the

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,109
website services are one-off they do not

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,349
order new websites everyone everyone I

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:18,329
mean true but think of something that

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,129
you can upsell if you if you if you

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,230
build a website for them there's so much

00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:25,110
more they can do for them in terms of as

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,440
you're in terms of marketing so what is

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:31,440
keeping them not to go for your services

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,209
but rather someone else so you have to

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,790
think about why why are they not going

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:40,680
back to you so this is the point I'm

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:43,500
trying to be so let's explore how the

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,099
traditional rule used to be without any

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,810
automation tools so a really simple one

00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,790
the first one is of course you create

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,680
the content so with by saying creating

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,690
the content you first research what I

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,190
want to talk about and then you create

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,930
relevant images or videos and then if

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:09,209
you practice good as your practice you

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:11,220
might you know do your tax and then

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,099
after that you schedule it on wordpress

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,280
you might do it using a sort of blocking

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,220
I don't do that I'm going to show you

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,329
hard way or you might ask one of your

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,000
stuff to do it for you

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,960
you might ask him to track the content

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,800
and have it scheduled on 10 here Tuesday

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,080
and then you have to impose it manually

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,880
after that you share it across multiple

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,520
social media so after you create your

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,229
post on your website then you log into

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,099
your Facebook or you're looking to your

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:45,900
tutor and you say that they put a

00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:47,970
specific caption like a have you checked

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,450
our data's close or something like that

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,960
and then if you well in your marketing

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:57,419
as well or newsletter you have to log

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,250
back in to your or your email writer

00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,500
that you are using and then you have to

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,539
create relevant you may just again and I

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,200
have to if you think of so dusty bust

00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:08,820
from your post and then after that you

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,849
have to select your niece or follow us

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,339
if you are tracking it using a

00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:18,679
customer research management CRM tools

00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:20,719
or Google gives or any extortion after

00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,259
that you have to restart for every new

00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,289
post

00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:27,589
so imagine doing this four times a month

00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:30,939
so it's really it can fix up to a day so

00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:34,669
it it's like four days for working days

00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:37,369
if you do not want to meet you so to us

00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:40,399
is that we not sustainable because first

00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:43,879
thing is repetitive it is really a

00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,949
problem and second it takes our

00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,990
resources it takes up your time it takes

00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:51,019
up your cubelet resources exactly or

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,839
your star power and then this on your

00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,639
growth because as an entrepreneur or if

00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,529
you are in the SME industry of course

00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,869
will focus on what matters to your

00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,759
company you want to give more time in

00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:03,499
business development you want to talk to

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,979
more people share what services you have

00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:09,969
not sitting in a row doing doing this

00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:12,740
kind of thing again and again so and

00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:15,019
also it's inconsistent because human

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,050
being errors so if you can do it

00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:20,059
manually sometimes or maybe maybe you

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,279
tell your client hey I'm going to put

00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:25,279
you on my newsletter I'm going to share

00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,839
posts once every two weeks but just so

00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,329
happen that that week you are really

00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,610
busy and you miss it so you send in the

00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:34,219
next week now it might even be something

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,050
that is really small but to some people

00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:39,550
it might seem unprofessional is

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:42,740
inconsistent so if you let the

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,289
technology do the work is more

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,709
consistent and it takes up that's what

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:49,449
you find so I'm going to share what we

00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,639
can do

00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,969
so if you have all that pop up feel free

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,770
to do it somewhat on a Tuesday you can

00:06:54,969 --> 00:07:00,789
utilize to organize overflow

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:04,629
systematically what's my Xavier where

00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:09,360
philosophy reform plan for that

00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:12,550
so Ziggy is known as a platform that is

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,499
it can enables two platforms to talk to

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,289
each other so imagine what press talking

00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:19,029
to Facebook so if you have like a post

00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:21,219
on your presence like what press turning

00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:24,249
Facebook if I have a post can you also

00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,839
create a post on Facebook so they will

00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:28,689
communicate to each other and they were

00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:33,580
to meet for you without even realizing

00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:35,770
it so what are the several tasks that we

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,930
can do I save you so the first one is

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,270
that it can helps you to engage your

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,249
audience on Facebook

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,409
ethically and the next one is it helps

00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:45,009
you to engage your head or there's work

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,499
to be done

00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:49,389
so these are more basics this is my

00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:52,059
personal favorite it helps you to make

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:54,580
data-driven decision so it helps you to

00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:56,909
track the metrics that matters to you

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,909
the most

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:06,300
so the Facebook few screenshots you guys

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,120
can try it later

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,340
so the first steps is across uniqueness

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,229
there so or each button on top

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,099
you make what's that so exam is

00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:20,490
basically impossible so after that you

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:24,099
choose a tree so what is the trigger

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,440
trigger basically means that what do you

00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:30,430
when do you once a people do something

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,680
so as you can see from the screen I have

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,320
to select what press because I want to

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,159
do something when something is triggered

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,740
on my go press website so the first

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,539
thing is that I'm going to do is to

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,100
worry for bigges fancy but it basically

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,860
says you comment anywhere or you post so

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,800
for me I'd like there to do something

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,730
when I have a divorce so whenever I post

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,860
the impose the penalty trigger so I I

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,160
link it to my personal website so ask

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,940
address did you know and again and then

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:11,079
I tell together my post data's should be

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:14,230
published so if I do so if I create a

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:16,480
post in draft or in private

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,310
it wouldn't post it to Facebook so

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,220
that's what it means and then I won the

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,380
poster to be possibly so if I add a page

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,730
it wouldn't be treated as well so it's

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,710
very specific and

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,940
really wasn't also be really creative

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,770
within and what happens next is that now

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,650
that it knows I want you to do something

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,660
when I have an impostor my healthiest

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,720
took that I wanted to create a Facebook

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,540
page post when I have got imposed on the

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,410
press so what does he do

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,450
so it will ask me for my page so if you

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,010
have a Facebook page if you don't please

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,860
go and create one right now is really

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:59,510
important link it to your to your

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:02,660
company page and then it asks you to put

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:11,090
a message that you want for your for

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:13,910
your clients I thought said what cannot

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:16,670
when a ad your imposes on check out

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,980
football now the green box is it was

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,560
basically like a shortcode so what it

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,930
means is that it takes value from your

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,670
WordPress site and substitute into it so

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,830
the next time for example if you have a

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,640
new post title happy merry Christmas

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:34,070
everyone in you know say hi everyone at

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,860
both what can K are linking your

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,080
imported stop check our readers post

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,080
which is happy Merry Christmas so it

00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,710
works as if you're typing it so it's

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,650
really good

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,540
the next one is the link URL it was the

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,880
same thing as well is it what signal

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,100
into a shortcode it substitutes the

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,990
value so every time we have a new post

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,050
is substitute already so you wouldn't

00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:01,970
think it back to the new post as we link

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:05,390
it back to the hopefuls so that's why so

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,160
after these the other so basically you

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,130
just have to give yourself

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,710
to anyone so that we can identify it and

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:15,220
then if I give it or your staff can and

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:19,580
then it checks your WordPress website

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:21,530
every 15 minutes every 15 minutes so you

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,180
just have to focus on writing you don't

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,450
even have to go back to this step again

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:30,530
you just have to say setup once and you

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:33,620
will handle the rest of it so this is

00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,870
how it looks like once you're done so it

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,600
kicks your information automatically and

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,730
put it on Facebook or your message data

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,790
written just now and most of your kaito

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:47,300
and your excerpts so I'm just doing two

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:51,500
dummies post here and then you can so

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,030
this is basically how it looks like so

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,280
Twitter I'm just going to go through

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,850
this really fast because it was the same

00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,440
so just now like I said you tell they

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,200
appear that they wanted to be triggered

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:06,290
when you add a new post so tada it looks

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,330
the same so I told you that every time I

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:13,940
have an impulse I want you to create an

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:15,890
image 240 so I tell I tell they fear

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,680
that my tweet content is hi everybody

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,380
you can't kill a few check out our

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,540
latest post then I put a title there so

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,490
the green color again it was like a

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,320
shortcode so it's substitute the title

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,050
in for you you don't even have to type

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,940
in the title again and then the image

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,920
you just link it to the featured image

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,620
so every time you put an image in

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,960
WordPress post it does it for you want

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,960
to test now so you don't have to go back

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,880
and forth back and forth to us multiple

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,460
social media platforms and also guess

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:52,010
what every size away so that's the fun

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:55,580
part and that's it so we are done this

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:58,580
is this is what appears so it's ready

00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,180
from here and that one is my personal

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,300
favorite

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:06,120
so this is something else that's common

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:09,750
because people are delighted you say pr2

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,860
to do this function but our show what I

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,680
can do with revisions so again I chose

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,260
the st. River which is whenever I have a

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,870
new post I tell Xavier to do something

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,050
but this time I wanted to create a new

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:29,880
bro in diversion so what have they done

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,440
can I attract so for me the best what we

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,650
can read but I'll read up for you I

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,010
wanted to trap my SEO score so if you

00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:40,890
have your stocking pretty sure most of

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,920
you guys use it on your WordPress it

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:47,250
will track the stores for you and also

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,470
in your post ID and you can track many

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:53,160
other different metrics but for the

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,810
sing-off okay Kara I chose the simple

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,270
metrics where we have to see so of

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:00,480
course I think is really useful if you

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:02,910
are a coder so if you are doing with CSS

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,680
and one page might be rather than

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,720
reading from the promoting you can just

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,580
get it from version is really dance

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,830
important so on a signal finally it will

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,480
show you something at least so every

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:21,120
time you work under stuff to have a look

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,360
at it you can basically see each post

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,860
it's not doing so well on SEO and then

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,620
you can tell your stuff hey you need to

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,140
look into maybe you are making some form

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:35,280
of backlinks or into the mix or your

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:37,920
texts are wrong your h1 tags or

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,020
something like that and it's really

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,600
useful because and it was you to focus

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,810
on what matters rather than going

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,820
through the post again again so let's

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,830
look at how they appear we defined

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,630
overflow so previously that's like so

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,030
many different steps right now music

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,310
what's that we're just one step which is

00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,510
creating the content you just create a

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,120
content and you do

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,550
for you using the right way it can even

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,710
track actionable data actually

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,900
actionable data I said they thought that

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,020
you can use it to improve your workflow

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,780
right now that's it for Xavier I'm going

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:18,360
to go into a different which is a vision

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:22,170
so well no before you so muchi is

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,530
basically email marketing tool it

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:28,800
automates your email marketing expert so

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,120
what are sample tools are several tasks

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,880
that you can do make them cheap for

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,280
engagement so the first one is it shares

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,120
your blog updates you know newsletters

00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,860
you don't have to crop it all away

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,900
it just take some new post substitute it

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,110
and then I send out to your so to your

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:49,590
audience by the people BPO daily

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:53,250
depending on your own preferences and

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:55,620
the second one is it sends a sense of a

00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,210
welcome message it's something that is

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,690
really useful if you are running an

00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:03,090
infamous or what is a website because

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,160
imagine you know so somebody's not

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:08,940
subscribing to your sector you send them

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,400
30 percent is gone for the first time

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,590
and then you can actually track who

00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,070
opens them up who opens the email and

00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:19,560
who needed so these are really powerful

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,120
metrics they wanna track right now it's

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,330
been useful so I'm going to be show you

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,790
guys how do I do it I'm going to name my

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,629
steps for you start on Wednesday you can

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,459
name

00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:31,999
so the first step again you can create

00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,579
an account

00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,269
ouchy is totally saved a source of free

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:41,329
but they have a guitar a guitar a victor

00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:45,199
so you can first create a create a step

00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:47,720
and just go up here so basically they

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:52,189
will ask you for your as a RSS feed URL

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,110
so it is by RSS feed URL basically it's

00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:57,170
just asking before you are your problem

00:16:54,110 --> 00:17:02,089
so basically if you if for me my pumping

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:06,740
is digital so my slash blog so for you

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:09,289
it might be what company is this blog so

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,649
once you give it that data they will

00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:13,669
know where to look for new post when we

00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:16,309
put something in

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:19,069
so there are also when should we say it

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:21,620
so you tell them that I want you to say

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,809
on Friday or Thursday or Wednesday so

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,779
it's your preference and then you can

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:32,299
select a time

00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:34,399
so once there are us what emails okay

00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,950
they wanna post what's the email subject

00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:39,080
develop ooh so for a sake of what can

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,110
krf simply find it so I'm just going to

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,990
put post from asset as a street fighter

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,450
so what does that mean it means title of

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,270
my website so we just substitute the

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:55,940
title of my website the name and put

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:58,760
there for us as in so mustard what does

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,060
that mean it means the the day that you

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,240
are sending out so

00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:06,940
you say who's wrong what can carry out

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,610
an ad for this week or something like

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,640
that so you know that is it's the latest

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:15,820
update certain you don't between battery

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,760
again so again you can also put your

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:21,940
name and any name they won so if you're

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:25,270
running a certain base part for your

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,940
company or someone that they can you

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,830
know connect it with something that

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,300
represents your company make it

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,220
interesting for them to interact with

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,020
you can put that as well and then you

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,200
can choose the email address and the

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,700
last thing that is my favorite is the

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,480
personalization so what does that mean

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,630
so personalization basically means that

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:51,610
you can watch the text to the name again

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:53,800
so basically imagine let's say our sign

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,660
up for my newsletter rather than saying

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,990
one edge in the other comp I can say

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,880
dinner will come so it looks more

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,120
personalized like a right thing that you

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:08,140
did my son so so it makes the authors to

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,060
you more engaged so so so then so solid

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,390
you might say oh I'm not cooking

00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,460
designing templates what if I wanna be

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,490
real good

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,350
instead of stupid well guess what cheap

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,930
actually have done that for you you just

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:24,120
have to select select the template you

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:30,270
want to use right now and put your own

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:32,610
pictures so that's it you're done after

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:36,870
that when you have substitute all those

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:40,320
in you basically get a newsletter set up

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:43,110
every every Wednesday like what I want

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,210
and a certain time to my audience and

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,210
you were automatically substitute the

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,380
latest post whim so depending on how

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,330
many posts you want to show your

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,060
audience baby's tree may be in store or

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,350
maybe stools so you do that

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,190
automatically for you so it's really

00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:04,020
useful so the next one is the last one

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,640
is coming in subscribers and yeah it's

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,700
pretty straight forward so what does it

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,530
do is that every time a new stuffs for I

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,500
just subscribe to my things that I

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:16,290
wanted email Auto PSS to send to them

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:20,250
right now so I would say hey welcome to

00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:22,350
me inclusive Club enjoy your stay or

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,600
these are some stuff that you can start

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,030
with so it really comes from the

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,460
onboarding process so if you're running

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,930
a store when you're running a blog or

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,730
you're running a website it's really

00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:37,770
useful because people know what they are

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:43,530
supposed to do when they first engage

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:46,110
your website so when you are where we

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,330
are not incorrectly if you have selected

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,980
template it should look something like

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,800
this you can also create your own

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:57,060
template basically works the same as

00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,800
page builder but but probably not as not

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,330
as in from I know most of the page

00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,390
builder right now you can

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,820
Jackie Rao and it's really useful

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,640
because you can put some CSS as well but

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,159
I don't think so we can wait with with

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,279
with their chain but nevertheless it

00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,049
works really so it's pretty observant

00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,720
you just have to play around with it

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:23,340
subsidy your own image put potassium a

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,890
surety audience and you're done you

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:31,019
start an operation so what this does is

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:33,480
every time every time no matter where in

00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:37,620

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:40,519

onboarding process lots of stuff that

00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:50,340
you can do and so on so forth so it's

00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:53,490
really useful you no longer have to trap
