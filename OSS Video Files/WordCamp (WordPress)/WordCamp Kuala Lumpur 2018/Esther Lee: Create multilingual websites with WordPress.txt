00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,030
time to be many different things for

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,070
different speakers and just well say

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,840
thank you to they meet Andrew so many

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,240
people give him a chance speak over here

00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,539
so today my talk day is going to talk

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,449
about to the groom website will be live

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:29,460
in WordPress and how easy is even using

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:32,220
the wiki and after doing it what's

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,470
multilingual website some of you may be

00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,260
very new to this particular body

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,170
so basically multilingual administrator

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,160
your website was translated into

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,440
different languages so for example when

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,020
I'm your website or e-commerce or more

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,000
homers from a client the same time they

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,630
were other personalities you know

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,840
molester I have fired from China I also

00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,940
find information so what can I do it I

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,790
wish I have two different website one

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,369
websites in China or West explanation or

00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,770
should I have multiple translation so

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,870
for this I issue will depends on their

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,900
business model so let's say for example

00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,560
in this company we are running different

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,260
a marketing strategy for a free country

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,960
let's say I give examination Amy we have

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,360
this multicart right the whole month of

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,730
August we may be running different type

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,500
of marketing strategy in that state if

00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,500
you buy during this period

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,530
so these are of market strategy made no

00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,040
money are the country for China or

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,000
higher so if you want to run

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,490
intervention marketing strategy for

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,470
different country then running different

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,950
website in different country you work

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,650
that way but in cervical in certain way

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,020
from my client media context always the

00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,940
same whether you read Chinese very

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,110
English is there anything it's the same

00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,440
it's just that they need different

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,660
languages to be translated so if the

00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,780
method is everything thing that I would

00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,540
encourage them to create a multilingual

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,640
website which is just website one

00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,080
website but they are having different

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,210
languages to be translated you have a

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,880
the face of doing multilingual herself

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,950
okay so that's the imagine you are

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,890
selling item in the venture so you have

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,420
let's say 100,000 our customer so angle

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,850
you will expand this list view and

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,490
expected maybe are the China or maybe

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,920
Thailand so when you are spending they

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,290
are the business in the different

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,880
country in able to translate the

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,220
language that they are only give

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,050
language basically you can do magic

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,910
customer please the getting one

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,180
Americans our customer our heart other

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,040
cells you may be getting 200,000 see you

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,110
how many increase ourselves and your

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,290
customer base will be expanded now

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,520
so the third model is good is which is

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,920
saving the cost

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,410
imagine if you are running one website

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,570
for one country so you're going to have

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,270
to batch of people to maintain it

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,280
give yourself a different country so

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,040
imagine you are doing everything

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,140
one website so you receive her a lot of

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:17,260
trust and also timing you just have to

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:19,540
say everything they are generated are

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,270
two ways of doing the translation that

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,220
even if you are lazy or maybe you know

00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,320
do not that much of time doing it

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,690
specifically you cannot use it

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,959
automatically glitches Google I will

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,630
translate the turkey if you have the

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,470
time and you want these to be

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,750
professional everything will to be

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,940
translated in a very professional manner

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,830
matter they will have to go to the

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,660
manual way so there are different block

00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,480
is in the market which is the Builder

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,180
clear now polyline we blood kill

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,280
translate but due to try timing

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,650
constraints are me able to speak one

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,580
which is today al-qaeda to Vietnam

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,739
why are not using polyline is because

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,140
Khalid is giving free as well but if you

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:06,520
want to use him for more commerce you

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,620
have to pay additional 99 USD in values

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,410
it'll appear now ecommerce normal

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,110
website and also no commas and it's only

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:17,080
just USD seventy time so it's actually

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,489
which one that you want but I decided to

00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,160
use the movie Emma's goodness a lot

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:23,169
Hakim is supported to many scenario to

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,630
translate different clock healed he will

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:30,280
move as well so this is one of many than

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:33,190
why I wanted to be around okay I was

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,800
basically later I will show you there

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,840
well there's few parts that we wanted to

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,600
I only kept a few parts of the

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,030
translation due to the time type of

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,450
trade so I got your heart to do it for

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,770
the page the pulse manual BJ if I have

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,540
and if you're not trying to go for the

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:56,290
Moo Commerce and try to outdo for the

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:57,670
cattle to me so for this demo these are

00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,920
the dad stop

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,190
so basically I'm using visual composer

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,170
builder revolution slider this slider is

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,810
going to be in the home page the big

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,900
banner and a WooCommerce standing block

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,060
okay now the field to number nine one

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,730
two three four five is just my plugins

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,400
all of them is by the loop here now so

00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,200
after you purchase the plug-in from the

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,300
view here now basically needed now a

00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,820
different little bit of blockage over

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,370
here so these are the full range if you

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,040
want to install it for just a normal

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,200
website has in commerce if you do not

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:40,000
want to use Buchanan's the number six

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:41,950
you can actually scale it off sorry just

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,710
let me show you how it works in the real

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,380
life I wish and look at the internet

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,080
connection is good so that the loading

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,550
narrative was wrong so I will not go

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,030
into everything to detail but

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,960
you have to us in or how these things

00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,790
will go

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,650
so basically these are the clock in that

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:06,290
song I use it for it's ok so this is my

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,750
have a page so if you look at the top

00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,250
left side okay these are the dead

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,800
language switcher that I actually

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,510
created previously I also can have a

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,210
language feature in the menu you have

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,700
money and then these are the team I'm

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,700
using which is a royalty if you want you

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,140
can go to cheat for a second by the

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,510
reason I'm using Royal chickens because

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,690
it's very flexible it for me the package

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:33,680
evening again so this sorry this one is

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:36,650
the revolution slider so this is subtext

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,480
but I do to type I cannot call I cannot

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,700
trust everything but I will try to the

00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,190
big deal so let's say this is the home

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,190
page we will click on the Chinese

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,710
you'll be able to will be the Chinese

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,340
mission

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:58,670
ok if you go into the facts right this

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,830
is the original really but all this data

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,260
simply trust really doesn't mean

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,240
anything terribly from the English and

00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,830
Justin Bieber subtract is that actually

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,760
you can you can imagine this effective

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:13,310
Justin Lauria so ok so an apology in

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,620
English version so you can do it on this

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,690
thing so let's see this is a proper way

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,080
of doing the translation if you are in

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:25,130
the shop page and you want to convert an

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,350
English which motion can you receive

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,550
English if you look at a using different

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,860
information I have seen English

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,500
more products and the Chinese that I

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,720
circled up that's because I have not

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,580
tried stick to different products so

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,530
that you will have Chinese one mission

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,420
of the website and English is together

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,610
which one works are you will depending

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:49,890
on whether you translate our unity to

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:56,100
the Chinese okay let's get started how

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:57,900
we are doing it in the back so and this

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,190
is the first thing you'll be seeing if

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,840
you couldn't WPA a language okay the

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,650
first thing you need to do is you have

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,340
to create like which okay you can add a

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,260
language over here so they are a default

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,440
leaves of the language that is relieve a

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,560
clear here so let's see I want to have a

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:25,920
belief so I just add name and I fixed it

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:28,410
so it takes some time if it success you

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,570
go back to here below you see in the

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:35,010
liberation when you click on a nation

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,870
came before so you see something are

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:44,569
there but if there's no like many what

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:48,230
we have T okay so let's go back to

00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:49,819
so over here you can change in different

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,660
languages were selected today I have

00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:53,179
second wish

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,790
but maybe one day I decided I think my

00:08:53,179 --> 00:09:00,170
pocket had to see to China China

00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:02,689
so maybe one day again so it's actually

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,920
depend on you to decide what is the

00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:10,189
default language that you want to use

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,069
okay so actually over here is a lot of

00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:13,429
stuff in them I will only focus for such

00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:16,040
things

00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:19,429
so this is the default language and also

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,980
and so one day you realize that I'm

00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:27,709
going to explain my market to to a place

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:30,319
maybe Tyler okay okay or maybe one day

00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:32,420
is on the calendar I wish that is not

00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:34,759
supported here okay you cannot find a

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:38,389
language maybe something that is very

00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:40,549
real languages cannot be fine here so

00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:45,949
what you can do is you click on any

00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:48,139
language over you can decide to have

00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:51,319
your own language that is one maybe over

00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:53,689
here this is called ABC language this is

00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,910
a chocolate and over like that and then

00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:58,279
now if you look at it is a translation

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,980
right we should be nothing in Chinese

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,079
okay what is the name of the world if

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,059
you have it is an English version where

00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,799
is a block of them where is the English

00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:11,029
version of this particular task and this

00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:13,369
you can choose a country and then this

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:16,189
is an informal control again it is

00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:17,339
mainly uses fire URL so you can have

00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:21,830
your

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,830
and then okay let's go back

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,420
this is the first part that I'm going

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,520
Toa which is just our mention is

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,860
creating the language that you wonder

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,440
having a website so the second part is

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,630
the URL format how do you want the

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,190
ground format to be not some of them

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,580
deserve to have something like this

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:47,400
connector which from ABC and ABC top our

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,110
MSM easier but for me have people to be

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,280
something like this which is a mystery

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:56,040
Locker / the end of / and answer / image

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,230
does not record so is anti up to you how

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,930
you want to study based on your own

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,720
profits okay this is I can follow me so

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,810
now we move to the top artists attic so

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,760
the top of it first of all maybe this is

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,090
a semester importance which option the

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,310
switcher which is over here and this one

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:16,950
this part this is a switcher this also

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,540
this picture came so maybe you want to

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,730
have Center border

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,530
basically maybe in Chinese is a person

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,280
should be up here or you think English

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:31,140
first and Canadian Chinese then you can

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:33,180
actually drag drop the something are we

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,970
having funding so this one when they

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,580
measure our new language handles without

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,590
the fixation what amazes over here is

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,870
that okay that's the different languages

00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,240
in which you create a post or page or

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,730
anything the Chinese version you haven't

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,530
translated yet so should they mean I

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,690
went back to the homepage for you are

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,330
actually still showing the page but we

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,660
remain English so let's imagine you have

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,100
this shop page okay but you need not if

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,670
you look at here this normally version

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,980
right so let's say do you want to show

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,780
the Millea way here but when the click

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,600
is remaining this version

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,890
is English but you will not show you it

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,440
will not be derived back to the Amish

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,480
that's much better

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,360
so this second part what we will do is

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,910
we will create a language switcher in

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,000
Daniel and we also the pop out the

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:28,710
Krenim language which is a feature so

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,100
how to do further menu and so ever again

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,480
I think it's easier okay you be buddies

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,970
you have a creator on managing first

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,420
second is a medicinal value so I want to

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:42,030
put it the women you know okay so do you

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:45,090
want to appear the first menu what it

00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,920
means is like before the homepage you

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,650
were similar man this picture or you

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,370
want to seal it after all the menu and

00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:55,470
back so this is what you mean first menu

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,240
item for us than you so do you want to

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,030
be a dropper or you want to be in the

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,130
list of languages something like that

00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,650
but I prefer the drop-down today maybe

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,530
not all the spaces especially if I have

00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,850
a long method so these are differences

00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,040
are things going to have do you want to

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,650
put a flag you will shortening in

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,190
language let's say in Chinese dragon

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,810
receiver

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,550
when over here do you want to show on

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,560
this thing for you to know what they

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,480
just take it off and then I'm usually

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,569
the current language do you I'm sure it

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,110
so these are the circus a can put Karen

00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:32,189
language means some of them let's say if

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:35,430
you are in English version okay then the

00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:36,540
one this English me meant to be here so

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,209
that's what it means

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,579
so these are the colors that you will

00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:43,170
see any colors the imagine some menu

00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,540
right maybe there so the background

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,029
color my pendant beautiful colors I do

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,000
necessity but imagine you know menu God

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,949
background color black powder then over

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,829
here you can as you can do also the

00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:57,829
something magical self is preset okay

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,810
so you will see something like that so

00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:15,750
it is all preference and also something

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,750
fun for me I prefer

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:34,040
maybe had to clear the Konami border

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,080
region so the region are doing it also

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,240
exactly same not how you do it for the

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,950
planning so in the region you can

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,260
actually choose wherever we to take it

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:47,210
up great so I have a region called life

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:49,250
cycle which is over here so I won't get

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:52,310
here this is a region so I actually

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,990
chose a region had one and over here do

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,580
you want to be horizontal are you going

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,860
to be a drop-top for me actually

00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,170
horizontal this is our attribute but for

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,050
me to choose horizontal because I want

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,240
people to see it without anything

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,980
so the same career data in from the

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,870
customer are to quit on me and see all

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,000
these other languages when I'm booting

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,520
it already in one class and look at me

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,810
like a tyranny cleverly so it's more

00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:19,310
user friendly if I'm using this factor

00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:22,330
so these are the color and if you want

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:25,130
you can put a widget I talked to me is

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,230
so maybe these are a few things you can

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:30,410
do the same thing if you have time you

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,720
can play around with others but due to

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,760
the time constraint I couldn't show

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,240
everything to you so I just want to show

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,120
the mean that instantly in order for you

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,550
to get up to how how to translate it

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,110
okay so now I already have all the third

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,510
thing I have we the English

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,629
Malay Chinese version I mean English

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,250
village has languished for

00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:53,980
so now I need to start doing the

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:57,329
translation so the first thing what we I

00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,069
need to do is our go-to pages for us

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,920
okay so these are other pages that I

00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:07,329
have okay so that's the imagine I want

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:10,660
to translate and imagine I want to

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:14,259
translate this home page to Chinese okay

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:17,670
so this is a duplicate format offer is a

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:22,300
duplicate version of a system company

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:25,600
okay so if you look at this ha

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,120
which is my right hand side okay what

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,430
you can do is for me normally one do is

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,339
a foot on it and I will duplicate the

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,290
content so they discuss say whatever you

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,180
have over here YouTube look at it

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,269
exactly the same one and I represent the

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,939
same and then you will be in different

00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:44,259
way sure okay in the provision is the

00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:46,990
content the same but you still have a

00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:49,089
translate by itself but that's the first

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:53,019
thing that we do first so after you

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:57,910
translate right after you click the

00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:59,529
track sleep here this evolution so how

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,240
do you know this one is an English

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,759
version or is in the Chinese version

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,589
you always can look at the top where if

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,870
your English between this is the English

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,669
version of this particular page says

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:12,539
they all end in the Chinese version that

00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:12,539
were Chinese

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,540
so this is a Chinese question so you how

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,700
do you know you can double-check on if

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:27,260
you can do if you look at the regulators

00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:29,480
you have okay and the first thing is

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,370
revolutions like that so I wrote for

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,540
this on who phone well whichever come

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,580
back later and to translate revolutions

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,760
like that so this is one reason why I

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,560
love to use the blue PMS because there's

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,620
a lot of luck in there were so Polly as

00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,290
you can to translate already recognizing

00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:53,560
the pocket if you are using certain of

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,560
sorry sorry okay

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:05,820
before you translate to any slighter

00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:08,490
okay I mean because patent insider go

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,840
through the slime except inference first

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:14,880
of all you need and evil meat and they

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,480
both exacting so you go through the

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,970
general setting mr. Venus Michigan 20

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,559
wrong else you were not able to track

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:30,779
anything after you turn it on then you

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:31,440
can go to the editor so yeah or we can

00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,289
say this

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,630
choose the language so this is this kind

00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:38,639
of water whatever exit right now this is

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,950
an English version so you gotta trust

00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:44,000
Chinese and click on it so this is the

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,000
transformation of it

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,310
anyway it's okay if you click on this

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:08,510
Chinese version what you are sorry you

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:12,830
just have to click on that it's like and

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:17,980
you will see the Chinese version so you

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,980
can click on it a little bit then you

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,750
can these are all the body so that's

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,090
it's done then just wish to thank you

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,920
safely so if I go back to the English

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,540
which I want you to do is just click

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:40,490
here

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:42,680
they look like this like in so that's it

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,320
if I want to do the ballet what I do is

00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,650
I click here and I have a new language

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,550
which is called a so now you were three

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,550
different version

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:01,990
so you can try stick it directly if you

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,140
find it this is very if you could

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:09,160
sometimes a shortcut way what I do is I

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:13,600
just create this think or maybe Chinese

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:17,170
like then when I go to here I instead

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:22,330
choosing English like I just write like

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:24,430
this one those who actually want a shot

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,570
a doctor you can t do it this way so

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,770
this is how your translating slider

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,780
homepage for any piece you want to have

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,540
we should actually only taking a couple

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,600
initiative in charity so right now going

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:40,090
to be page that we have right now so the

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,240
first part of it is done the slider so

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:49,140
now the second part let's say we want to

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:52,140
change the title say this thing okay

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:56,820
so always be sure that you are Chinese

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,820
so then you do screw up English version

00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,470
this is a duplicate version okay it is

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,450
just showing you a new one

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:15,130
let me show you something that I have

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:18,420
already done you know the page stop

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:23,770
showing me right now this is innovation

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:26,260
Chinese first of all I can mission that

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:33,430
the name of the title of the page cannot

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:36,130
change and then how it's a slider the

00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,930
slider and we have to choose Chinese

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,330
waiter or whatever I just remain the

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,820
same slider and I just translated

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,010
properly revenue just like so let's say

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,680
this is that I thought this is what I

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,510
have changed previously so that you know

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,260
take out the time to copy and paste or

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,850
the translation so this is my talk this

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,330
is that especially you know these are

00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:01,480
the things which is what you see over

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:03,490
here our benefit righteousness so when

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,600
you do is in the window training you

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,600
receive faxes

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:27,780
okay so this is the page so now we go

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:31,470
for the post post addressing so many

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,840
Ballerini many bridges naturally so now

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,610
the post I am over the moon comments so

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,850
maybe I come back to post and then back

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:41,400
to time but I go for the product at the

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,530
WooCommerce directly they I can save up

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,530
time so that seemed products first thing

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,820
before you have to create a proper

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,500
Chinese version worried do is you

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,750
mission in the category already

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,240
translated to Chinese version so let's

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,760
the American English version this is the

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,540
different type of the category you have

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:05,070
so what you do is you know it and on the

00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:07,830
bottom you actually can click when you

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,770
click Add you come back to here you come

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:13,010
to the transit money and after the end

00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,210
of ago at the continuity mission that

00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,730
imagine that this is Chinese and this

00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:21,780
translator for this particular category

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:24,290
D so this is category so now both other

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,290
products

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,150
okay there's two products I have when

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,809
you one is already translated to the

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,309
Chinese

00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:43,110
another one is before so the one that

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:46,919
before you translate that what you see

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:50,480
is the same thing so you click on it and

00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,480
you just click the button duplicate

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,030
didn't figure this one being clearly big

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,960
about them

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:08,440
how do you duplicate us they are doing

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,440
it right

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:18,500
this is a version of a Chinese so I look

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,059
at it then you can do a translation so

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,590
that said I go back to the original

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:26,630
version that I've already translated so

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,820
this is English version if I want to

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:34,210
look at a Chinese version and just fit a

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,210
Chinese okay

00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,159
so this would be the Chinese version

00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:02,240
so basically in doing this one right if

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:04,730
you go to the shop page you will see

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:11,870
this is a translation so let's say I

00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:13,610
pick up this product to be wife I said

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,320
sorry just by showing this is the

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,450
category naeun that I do I translate

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,530
that for the categories for transmission

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,530
so let's go

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:30,170
so the description is Chinese okay and

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,810
let's say if the see this thing right is

00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,230
it Chinese right basically origins

00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:38,180
Confucian so this is a few item feel is

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:41,510
like you can think about ladies is a

00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,520
string so the Kouga the movie Emma allow

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,100
you to do all the translation including

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,500
the string so only one is not over this

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,410
one product description I'm going to

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:58,910
trust it is best to Chinese holiday so I

00:25:51,410 --> 00:26:00,860
go back to the back hand I go to the

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,310
OPML and I look for the string

00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,310
translation

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,780
so or whether you have a lot of

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,720
different upstream from black teens or

00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:16,510
the original press website or employer

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,820
on the team or market yet so that's I

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:22,590
you pasted over here this is a back

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:25,180
South London you will transmit station

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,760
then I will see different things these

00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,620
are the things things appear so what I

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:40,590
want to do is undo infestation or

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:40,590
royalty this effects

00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,410
in obvious for me for me the cloud of

00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:08,820
time so I have actually do some

00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:12,270
translation over here over here and just

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,070
below me and I'll paste it so that's the

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,740
Omni do for Chinese magician that

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,870
translation is called is completed if I

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,870
did not take this one right over here

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:25,790
you will not see the Chinese so that's I

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,790
take a quick spin

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:36,230
but then becomes transmission so if you

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:38,029
go to because this page is not

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,659
translated into Arabia so you would not

00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:44,299
see verbally country so you want to see

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,830
either English people English or way see

00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:49,429
that English merchants even though the

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:52,309
Chinese it will be in Chinese that's

00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:55,039
okay and you're working that you see

00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:58,880
over here including a cart or this

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:02,600
successfully added to that you can copy

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,600
and then go to the string and then a

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,750
wicked or simply and then you stitch

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,750
again

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,670
and then you click on the translation

00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:22,980
make sure that if this has something

00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:25,590
like this you will not see any changes

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,350
any language affects translate them so

00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,690
you will click that to cut you will see

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,650
that that's over here so basically you

00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,450
know comfortable to the document camera

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:39,930
is basically I know you tried several

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:42,690
pages of holes or you wanna do a static

00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:49,770
clock everything will be on your ass a

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:58,920
bit before the close if you want to

00:28:49,770 --> 00:29:02,429
translate sorry that said this is Jose

00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:09,240
another translate he will always at the

00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:10,740
right side just beat on it sometime this

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,120
thing is sometimes because internet

00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,550
connection to be slow it'll take a bit

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,750
time to go this particular factor so you

00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:20,580
just click on it there you are India

00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,650
nobody with English version the Chinese

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,940
version of they worship so how do you be

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,370
sure that you are always in the

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:30,360
regulation always be sure that top

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:32,940
Chinese okay this with Chinese question

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,980
so for me why do is were always that

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,140
Chinese money or let's say if this is a

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,429
new language in our part of the lake

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,390
naming of it

00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:44,550
so when I go to homes when I look at me

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,740
let's say for this one is the really

00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:50,039
translated that I know this is a range

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,919
so if I repeat booty in English name

00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,020
nimi well okay I have no idea whether

00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,360
this is the really fast data or not yet

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,789
translate so well okay this one okay

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,130
this is done so okay let's say we go

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,620
back to this one I have no more accuracy

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:07,620
can you look at the this is the naming

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,590
this is you are really translator you

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,330
looking at you are we always see em okay

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,299
this is the Chinese official but the

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,860
donator will have a slash and s so over

00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:19,710
here you can actually do your own

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:27,840
Chinese or whatever translation would

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:30,960
like to have it I think

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,720
most probably is none other than you see

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,360
less static law is that you press the

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,919
minus 16 is everything is always on the

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,720
right hand side you do the translation

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,850
always go back to hear you with my

00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,779
Chinese in English after you're done you

00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:47,640
just make sure that especially I will

00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:49,770
click on the Chinese to see whether the

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,960
hopes of my TV works which will your

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:55,020
translation is done so whether you want

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,630
to have to cut or even the milk a page

00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:01,830
or a checker is all controlled by the

00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:04,980
string string translation so generally

00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:07,720
for me I love using this one is because

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:11,019
I can control how details

00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,779
and I believe that this can help me to

00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:15,700
do all that all of it and to me the

00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:19,330
price is not that high compared to some

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,590
of other puck intensive which I check it

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,000
out someone in their custody

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,000
