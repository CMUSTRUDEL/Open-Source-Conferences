I'm the dissemination of myself so that

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,900
my son is a wordpress-based

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:17,240
web design agency just a little bit

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,170
about me I've always been interested

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,650
inside

00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:27,620
I spy I actually started coding in 2006

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:30,430
when I was 16 and my mom actually sort

00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,160
of like forced me to learn web design

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:37,190
she used to be an IP lecturer but she

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:42,800
did not teach me anything so I had to

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:46,250
learn everything by myself and then I

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:51,140
also picked up karate or Photoshop

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:54,860
Illustrator and in 2007 I moved to

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,520
WordPress before that I was using yahoo

00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,520
Geocities

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:08,000
so much video and login giving up

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:11,620
WordPress themes for people through use

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and down to it and use your thoughts

00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,000
then in 2009

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,159
and surprisingly I did not ID I went

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,650
into a completely different path and

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,020
chose architecture so I studied

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,390
architecture because I was so passionate

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,270
for design and then I would after

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,170
criteria after I graduate I quote of

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:41,100
Utah you just don't feel and then I

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,250
create so from 2017 and packed into my

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,390
design

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,390
[Music]

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:57,020
okay before we head on into our topic I

00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:59,720
just wanted to set the page right we all

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:06,460
know what UI design is so the oddity

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:09,950
side is it's just a design just for

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,739
interface for example a car a car it's

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:16,370
also using the car dashboard with all

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:22,850
the patterns and this is free the shapes

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:26,150
of speed as we display all of that it's

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,280
all user interface design every just

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:37,150
talking about you say interface PD not

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:40,229
use expedience aesthetics available

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,229
[Music]

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:48,080
because ultimately you can affect in

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,870
some ways the user behavior if you can't

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,510
see the buttons or if you don't know you

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,620
can't recognize the icons under buy

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,590
things then you

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,530
problems identifying with departments

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:07,840
for for example and then you can help

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:10,269
you with effective communication so that

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,319
you don't confuse people or you display

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:16,810
your information clearly and then you

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,410
can also help to increase conversion

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:23,379
rates when everything is so clear and

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:27,599
concise so is it is easy for your users

00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:31,569
to use it without much thought so that

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,690
and also for walkers and also pocket

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:38,319
Isaac's good good UN helps to retain

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:41,880
retain user interest so they will keep

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,880
coming back to your site

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,360
so mistake number one that I usually see

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,370
these mistakes are usually mistake the

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,370
SC around the web so

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,680
[Music]

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,270
so an example would be something like

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:14,239
this every element is demanding for your

00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:17,000
attention and issued things that are

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:24,620
bluffing and there's no way a website

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,919
can look something like this sorry this

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,430
is a website and once you land here you

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,520
really don't know where to go right

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,110
because everything is the same

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,970
importance so there's nothing that

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,710
stands out for you to click on okay so

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,010
what do you do when you want to

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,979
determine which one is important you

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,380
have to go back to your code and

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:58,820
understand it understand the audience

00:04:51,380 --> 00:05:03,200
and make sure that you read the choice

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:06,650
whether your based on that goal and the

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,440
goal should be unique to the client or

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,590
your own website and if possible narrow

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,910
down to only one main culture Tilikum

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:20,000
for just now what's the website

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,770
governmental so you can have more links

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,280
because he acts more like a type of

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:29,120
people content so for that kind of thing

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,539
you may have like one main call to

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,370
action but you must also not forget all

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:39,590
the other things so this is what mock up

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,580
might look like once you have narrator

00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:46,240
all your importance and this is how you

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,240
might look like

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,380
the website that you saw it does know

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,590
went through transformation with this

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,440
and this is what we proposed to them

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,590
watashi wa happen to the project given

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:06,350
the budget cut recently so yeah but as

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:09,770
you can see okay so as you can see

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:12,410
there's a search bar right here so it

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,250
doesn't mean poor thing because there is

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:19,250
a lot of pages on this website and then

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:23,290
the links are stuff like listing it down

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:28,190
like this we recommend using

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:30,950
categorizing the links using user type

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:36,350
of you soon so who are they the visitors

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:38,150
so they can click the relevant link to

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,900
them so let's see if they're a lawyer

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:45,410
they can click on this and that you only

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:51,250
see links rather than two lawyers for

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,250
example so here could be potent almost

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:02,240
accessibility this is something that

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,150
I've seen a lot because I understand

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,810
because sometimes when designers design

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:11,590
a layout there's so they're so focused

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,510
on the design of the real but they think

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:18,310
readability for granted the Frog gotta

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,810
chill try to read the text and

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,460
embarassingly sometimes it happen

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:29,210
Oh Agis so I have to keep reminding the

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:32,510
designers to always make a keep in mind

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:36,800
the readability this is why something

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:43,419
might look like if it's not you try to

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:46,880
read it Jori contrast or wrong calipari

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:51,110
so of course as designers or even

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,540
brokers are always test it up that's

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,090
Europe they make sure every word is

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,330
readable make sure you can be from left

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,370
to right without your eyes feel tired

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:05,210
okay so the things that you can check

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:07,930
our font size and color contrast and of

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,820
course don't forget to ask your mom to

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,520
try to read it because I'm sure if your

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:20,889
mom majority file additive a kind of

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,889
meeting okay that one is white space

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:31,740
so this is why it might be play when you

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:34,560
start to tune up okay the point is poor

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:41,430
white space anybody knows what a white

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:43,800
space is yes that's right the empty

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,840
spaces that means if you don't know what

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,740
it means to the rest of the people so

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,990
this is what it looks like without white

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,750
space okay nobody reads newspaper

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:59,010
anymore so we tend to forget it

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,230
so yeah I tried to find newspaper

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,990
screenshot that's more a little bit less

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,210
like Malaysian newspaper but everything

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,640
in that is so sensitive so I started to

00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,880
find when there will be new New York

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,790
Times newspaper fish instead yeah but as

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,900
you can see everything so cramped but it

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,920
could be different with newspaper

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,760
because they want to cram make it pretty

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,420
as much a dick to see one page to save

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,670
costs after it right so I show you how

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,300
it looks like on web maybe this is not

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,840
too critical but it can still happen but

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:41,520
what's happening here is this little

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:46,880
space between this is the font size so

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:51,570
you make is hard to read and it sort of

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,730
ties you up against so what you need to

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:58,540
do is to value it and try to be some

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:01,930
room utilize for CSS

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,000
the marching and padding which is like

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,850
conversation the spaces between the

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,560
section pay attention to light height

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:16,120
which is the space between the size

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,890
between the fun text lines then doesn't

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,730
make sense or if you're a graphic

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,650
designer

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:29,260
you call it leading size you can also

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:33,030
consider leaving some columns empty so

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:37,630
this is the improvement as you can see

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:47,980
but easier to read now that we have

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:50,710
species photos sometimes it's easy for

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,080
us to just take photos and just put it

00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:56,490
there on the layout you know just to

00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:00,420
spruce things up but we forget that

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,780
photos can make a statement for

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,480
separation

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,910
maybe this business about cup you know

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:13,960
it's my so-called decide blog obviously

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:16,240
the picture is irrelevant is dark is the

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,260
quality is so bad because it was taken

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,870
with the potato and then seat belts on

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:26,920
whatever and they're not a good pitching

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:29,160
of course so make sure to use a photo

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,800
that is rather think about the relevance

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:37,700
the photo and the content or the theme

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:41,180
of your blog or your website and

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:44,060
mm strategy placement and of course use

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:49,100
high quality code you don't need a

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:52,100
professional yessir are 234 this week or

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,690
always hire a photographer professional

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,700
photographer you just need a really good

00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,770
camera it can be a phone camera and just

00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,130
learn a little bit about composition

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:07,850
like the how you treat those things and

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:10,850
try to make your photo Specter so this

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:14,600
is what it might look like if I were to

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,400
change up the image so it's more alike

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,690
because it's a design blog and that's

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:26,510
the society it's a work setting and that

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:27,830
I think is what we it's sharp and I'll

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,570
show you what it might look like on

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:37,610
websites here we have our our client one

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:42,010
of our client project you can see that

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:46,490
on the products page this the

00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:48,560
transformer manufacturer and their for

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,640
the products page we use we showcase the

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,980
pictures of their Factory and quality

00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,600
standard we showcase like you know the

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:01,610
all closed up

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm cutting up the material to plate and

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:08,480
even here picture of this guy the

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,850
whatever equipment that they are

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,210
manufacturing and then on career page

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,000
showing staff their stuff like a

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,100
friendly outlook so that they want to

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,779
encourage people to apply right and then

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,459
picture of the past as to showcase that

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:27,269
you know you might be a boss someday

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:29,939
because this director actually went from

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:33,149
started as an engineer there and what

00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:37,139
worked his way up to the director that

00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:39,389
he is to be a picture of this so this is

00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:43,259
how you might want to you know plan out

00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:45,809
your website not just design the home

00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,259
page but also the inside pages as well

00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:56,040
and use those pictures and enhance your

00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:59,809
design and message next it is

00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:03,089
inconsistent elements font eye colors

00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:06,660
placements this this kind of thing I've

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:09,809
seen in a while actually but not at a

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:14,339
large scale but you can maybe sometimes

00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:16,829
like the design is like all sharp edges

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,199
and necessarily there's the piping that

00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:21,809
are rounded so you kind of make it out

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,379
of place for example something like this

00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:30,410
like shop shop horses and then we have

00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:33,240
not even curved radiuses so you have to

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,930
determine your theme like what is it

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:40,470
going to even say the colors to one or

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:44,730
two main colors and then try to leave me

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:47,250
- only - five times or if you want to

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,529
push it you can go for three but you

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,740
really know you must really know how to

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:58,379
use it and not make it like you don't

00:14:52,740 --> 00:15:00,540
want pochamp or Rocha pay attention to

00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,910
it is the type of shapes and lies that

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,959
you are using if you're using - lines

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:11,129
try to keep your - line for whatever

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,199
reason you want to use - nice so if you

00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:15,689
if you if you take that they are just

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,280
now and you change it out like this

00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:21,510
something wrong as we said

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:27,450
it looks much better very anyway and the

00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:31,080
next next one is too many stuff I think

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:33,390
this is becoming more infrequent

00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,820
nowadays like pop-ups too many football

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,180
powers and animations that doesn't make

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,120
sense by probably the renovations are

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,450
going down nowadays and then decorative

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:51,810
elements you know and you know SSS

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:54,600
styling okay this is an example and I'm

00:15:51,810 --> 00:16:01,110
quite embarrassed to show because Kim

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:03,750
was designed believed our agency if you

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:08,550
don't if you're not sure what's wrong

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:12,120
with it may be pointed out again out of

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:16,280
nowhere so it's part of the footer

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,280
coming out so it's a smooth design

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:29,850
Sabbath is forget the mobile team okay

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,100
so my view if something should be by

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,350
default now you don't even have to make

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,300
it like put it out there like oh we're

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,860
going to make your website responsive

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:43,800
Nori's but it's part of it's part of

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,720
your job it's part of you know you can't

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,990
separate I love you anymore

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,970
but sometimes I still see my dear

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,540
website they don't really pay attention

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:57,510
to mobile and you know even though it

00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:00,270
they are sort of like uber exactly but

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,640
we still have to like teach zoom go to

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:07,470
left and right to read so it has not a

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:11,220
very good overview experience so the

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:14,280
tips for mobile view is to always try to

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,490
reduce this curve maybe you can hi set

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:22,260
the content size certain elements or try

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:24,720
to make the content less for mobile and

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,390
then anything with pitched to try to

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,910
avoid at all cost because usually

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:34,380
doesn't work well so I forgot to mention

00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:36,900
here pop-ups pop-ups usually does not

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,750
work well on mobile phones make it

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,210
really depends on the mobile force that

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,640
the person is using sometimes it was

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,130
well with the problem sometimes they we

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,530
have problem child to enclose the pop-up

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:53,910
and then making your website totally

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:55,179
useless for them and then of course hi a

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,240
necessity

00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:01,179
and then I think a lot of it a lot of

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,940
some some website forget about this the

00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:06,400
size of the text so when you test it on

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,860
your mobile make sure you check again

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,330
check the size of the text it sure is

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,730
beautiful and not too small or not to be

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:22,420
usually that happens with the hadoo

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:26,080
hadoo better banner and fish one title

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:30,780
right usually on on web it will look too

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:35,610
big when you convert it so make sure to

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,610
customize it specifically for better

00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:46,390
point to wrap up here they recommend

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:50,860
this is our recommended fish builder

00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:53,049
that we also use in our agency reason

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,200
why we use fish Beadle because a lot of

00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:59,980
the time to decline as they that they

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:03,010
wanted to have flexibility to change up

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:07,679
the content so this is something that we

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:11,410
care a lot but obviously we've done

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:15,370
custom themes as well but where if you

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:19,360
want to pay for that animator is really

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:24,100
good is easy to use it doesn't help your

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,500
website speed as well and thing I like

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,050
about Elementor is it's easy to

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:33,380
transform it into responsive

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,330
mobile of you because you can always go

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,940
back to mobile view/edit up your

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,900
settings and then whatever you do or

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:46,130
desktop won't affect your mobile view so

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:51,890
it's really good if if it's DV in my

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:54,980
opinion TV it's very hard to customize a

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,730
mobile you need a lot of custom codes to

00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,740
add beaver builder i haven't tried

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:03,640
personally but my boss said is going to

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,640
side with him

00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:42,230
if possible it's best to alter all you

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:44,809
have to maintain it because if not be

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,309
like when click on other do you

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:47,900
see that they're going to another

00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:51,170
website because it's a different design

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:56,059
but if you can balance you know maybe

00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:58,190
50% straight-line 50% curve lines you

00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:00,820
know how to balance it of course you can

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:04,570
do it but if it's like you know suddenly

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,309
10% is curve and then the rest is all

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:10,990
straight lines is going to do awkward

00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,990
looks like is an afterthought

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,030
to

00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:48,429
I would suggest going on of course but

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,280
you deadly cars they have good process

00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:53,320
on UI design but if you don't really

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,330
want to go that path you don't have time

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,450
to go through all the courses you can

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,730
try for me personally what I like to do

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,039
and what I recommend other people is to

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:06,039
be a design maybe you can get from

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,250
Pinterest or whatever and try to do it

00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,700
yourself maybe with your software of

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:16,809
choice maybe for example either BSD and

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:19,120
try to copy exactly exactly like the tip

00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:22,030
that you like we sell to people don't

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,350
copy for 10 5 you just do it by yourself

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,780
30 and try to do it the same exactly the

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,809
same and if it's not the same you have

00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:34,960
to see you have to look for details why

00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:38,980
is it not the same from that way you can

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,100
learn about how to detail your UI design

00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,780
because before this you are not

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,659
attentive to that kind of details when

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:50,020
you try to give me it then only you will

00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:53,460
start noticing all the subtle details

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,460
that are in the UI design

00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,080
we can take two more questions

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:40,139
if you're if you're the one who built

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,620
the website yourself it's quite hard for

00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:46,429
you to gauge how many Scrolls

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,980
the best way is to actually ask someone

00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:52,679
someone else outside years ago and you

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,690
know ask them to to try but I think you

00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,210
can sort of that figure you know like if

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,629
you have like maybe six points of

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:04,169
something maybe like when I say it's

00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:07,200
like six breed of columns with text with

00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:09,840
a screen right so when you see mobile is

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,779
going to be that one long scroll right

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,029
so think about that like if the user

00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,399
really need that the user really need to

00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:19,529
read all of that six columns width of

00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:21,779
content before they get to the main

00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:24,330
point that's one thing so it's sort of

00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:28,139
like there's no real number you just

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:31,129
have to keep for yourself maybe but

00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:33,299
maybe another way to tell is to try

00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:36,360
experiment maybe you can explore

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:39,809
something that watch our apps and then

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:43,789
try to run it first and see if it in

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:48,799
advance how many people give up with

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:48,799
like how many people scroll to the ends

00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,680
so if there's a boundary I can enter

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,480
that but right means when people

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:40,040
learning to your website they didn't

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:44,650
click anyone of that a website your

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,650
website at all so it can be one made

00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:10,970
specifically for web prototyping so it's

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:14,150
much faster to do it with XD because a

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,740
lot of the stylings there are similar to

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:22,610
what you can do with CSS

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:25,430
I know don't you just burn time test it

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:29,900
comes up for you as image but you can

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:32,330
sort of like link up the art boys you

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,880
can create multiple our boys like that

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,980
you can in Illustrator and then you can

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,150
sort of like click the button when you

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:43,460
want the page to go sort of like like

00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,870
multi just images linked together

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:51,220
that's all yeah so it can be quite

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:56,210
impressive but it's very simple software

00:26:51,220 --> 00:27:00,710
so sometimes you need to get creative

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:05,860
okay retake one more final question

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:09,080
anyway because they have extra space

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,080
[Music]

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,410
okay that's a good question color

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,980
screams as kind of levity

00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:39,110
there are two ways to go about it first

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,090
start with the brand color okay for

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:44,300
example yellow you know you can either

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:51,110
use yellow or color that compliments you

00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:54,980
know maybe peel orange red or something

00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:59,480
like that or if you if they do not have

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,550
a brand color yet or if for some reason

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,080
they don't want to follow their own kind

00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:09,500
of locally future color right like a

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,720
wire something like that and they ask

00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,780
them they ask you to come up with a

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,620
color scheme what you can do is start

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,150
with bread with color emotions you know

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:26,780
are you familiar with cutting motions

00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:32,650
like blue blue is tied up to like trust

00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:34,700
for example yellow is happiness

00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,550
something like that maybe you can start

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:41,420
with that and red is aggressive and fast

00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:43,910
so a lot of KFC Madonna's nice red

00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:47,090
because it's fast and aggressive Asia

00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:50,420
aggressive yeah so you can start with

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:55,090
Cali ocean all right

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:58,330
that's right Bob that's all for today

00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,330
