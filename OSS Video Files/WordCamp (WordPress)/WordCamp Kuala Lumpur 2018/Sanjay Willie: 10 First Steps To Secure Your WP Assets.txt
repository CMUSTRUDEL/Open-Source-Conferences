I know but this time I actually wanted

00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:12,690
to talk about civility because super

00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:16,119
passionate about it and quite frankly

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:20,109
we've seen a lot of really scary places

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:23,230
of you know security problems if I may

00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:25,689
say so that relates to CMS like

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:32,439
WordPress and the other guys which are

00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:36,070
you know it is a concern and a concern

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,080
is not just to the level often perhaps I

00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,820
didn't have that a person owns the

00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,160
website getting hacked there is an

00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,310
ecosystem that is affected something

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,260
like that encapsulates even after the

00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,910
country level so this is something I do

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:56,410
for rich as well and also something with

00:00:50,910 --> 00:01:00,130
security and policies it regards to

00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:04,659
national level high definition things

00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:06,689
like so one thing that I want to share

00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,359
is that you know let's all come together

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:13,090
if at all I could do something today and

00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,560
that is to tell you follow the path what

00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,799
you know what are the first steps you

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
need

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,400
please do not do not feel shy to ask any

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,050
questions raise your hand I would love

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,640
if you wanna ask questions right where

00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,380
I'm actually speaking just raise your

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,420
hand and hopefully could make a

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,580
discussion rather than one way things

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,750
okay without further ado let me just go

00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:39,930
through a little bit of talk about so

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,640
it's simple it's actually it's rocket

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,220
science what I'm gonna try and do is

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,410
actually so unfortunate something I keep

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,200
telling my colleagues in the security

00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:52,050
world then security needs to be first

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,050
and foremost easy to understand because

00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,780
I can tell you all kinds of things like

00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:00,180
how I can look like what are the haters

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,940
pillows if it doesn't if you don't get

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,640
it that I lost opportunity to tell an

00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,080
audience what to do next is security so

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,320
I think it's a it's a safe and

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,930
responsibility for people this this

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,140
talks to ensure that the target audience

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,330
understands and take home one of these

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,430
10 things that you do today after today

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,100
I have done my wrong times I have

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,000
succeeded in ensuring that the overpass

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,280
side is

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,490
so I hope I be able to do that that is

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,830
why I asked appeal I feel you know

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,270
anticipation because you know something

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,490
you don't understand I'm taking all the

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:43,840
time either whether you see recession or

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:45,490
maybe outside to try to help okay so

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,959
that's the topics that we want to cover

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,640
hopefully we have the time to really

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,340
cover everything as much detail as

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,560
possible very short video so those who I

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,510
hope you can bring chassis but if you

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,510
want to breach as in I guess so

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,810
so what our WordPress assets this is so

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,790
solid what it's like I was thinking

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,239
about this slide because it's not just

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,950
good press binary see not just the

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,860
software that you put into a web server

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,959
so this is your best asset consists it

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,239
actually consists of everything from did

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,110
you go to the networking model if you've

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,370
got to connect this before si order

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,650
physical ran up to the application there

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,120
so all of these things are asset so

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,580
we're talking about things like the

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,290
physical server the network the switches

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,150
the firewalls it put in between the load

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,459
balancers keep it up to the provider

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,280
that you use these are all in assets you

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,260
know if you just think WordPress itself

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,920
the binary software it comes to the

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,260
backbone file that's a lot it's not

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,360
everything that is other components that

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,480
are interrelated and equally important

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,780
when you look at the ecosystem of

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,799
running a wordpress site and the last

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:05,910
what can help in this particular way we

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,519
also had a lot of exposure a lot of talk

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,230
about IOT integration when it comes to

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,840
WordPress which means you take your

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,790
WordPress site it expanded beyond just a

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,579
physical server it put things like nodes

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,169
around and I've seen one demonstration

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,840
where this guy actually uses WordPress

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,110
site and actually monitor plantation

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,750
using IOT

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,430
fits the data back into WordPress so

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,289
when he took my assets you know we have

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,349
to look at everything that interconnects

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,150
back to your work aside not just not

00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,990
just the actual binary of the server

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,699
that is running

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,520
okay so we'll be able to get to

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,409
qualities and things like api's API is a

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,219
big thing to the N and then you know

00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:47,569
businesses are created from API

00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:49,789
literally people are selling API as a

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:51,860
service around like I was just talking

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,379
to said he did push notification for

00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:01,939
beautiful be sure to get on the app he

00:04:54,379 --> 00:05:04,520
did not necessarily when I do the push

00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,990
messages instead he just render the

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,050
service that actually does that

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,539
so API is also an Arabic the word press

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,879
is the box of the API is that it took

00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:16,520
the nine other websites to connect other

00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,639
services and also things like IOT

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:29,900
devices if I'm going too fast somebody

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:31,879
just okay here's a very important

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:39,110
message that I want to bring it up and

00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:41,659
it's really it's about they're just so

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,520
security is for all let's just stop that

00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:47,960
for a while and think about what the

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,229
site's trying to say essentially I don't

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,020
officially whispers end this progress

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:56,029
organization but I do definitely much

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,620
people like even of the community you

00:05:56,029 --> 00:06:00,340
know so the responsibility of the

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,690
community is caught

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,880
it's a collaboration it's a it's a

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,520
quotation of all people all kinds of

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,150
people we used WordPress like for

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,890
example if if you have deployed

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,500
WordPress at the scene secure WordPress

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,600
can compromise people hack it gets into

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,650
a statistic and thatis that is it will

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,260
say oh another WordPress site in fact so

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,420
as responsible users as responsible

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,430
system admins and also system and

00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,310
integrators it is important that we take

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,100
this opportunity to not only just secure

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,990
site but also bring that confidence back

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,000
into society really confidence back to

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,410
the WordPress community so that's the

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,500
message I'm trying to say so it's a fall

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,240
so people here are developers I spoke to

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,490
some developers and the people who are

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,490
who wrote beautiful plugins and themes

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,890
and everyone needs to be information to

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,530
this everyone needs to to be part of

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:56,650
this effort to secure WordPress because

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,630
it's an ever-growing platform like last

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,790
WordPress pharmacy it was 20 something

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,310
percent of the world's websites running

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,220
WordPress and today we hit I think 30

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,380
percent sacrificer 30 percent of the

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,670
world's website that's huge

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,030
I'm saying it like Donald Trump that's

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,030
you

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,280
that's huge that's huge I mean if you

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,580
think about it that's that's literally

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,080
the woman website if you take a spoon

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,460
and true at one website there's a

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,290
one-third chance for the hitter

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,410
WordPress site you know that's literally

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:31,680
like that so it's crazy so in order for

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,370
us to grow we need to have all of these

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,590
ecosystems thought of things like

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,150
protecting you fight there then I say

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,610
protecting the interests of WordPress

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,680
itself and that's people like us you and

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,260
I people to deploy people write code

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,600
people build these build plugins we have

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,090
that responsibility to ensure that our

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,220
sites are you know secure so that we

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,990
contribute to a positive growth of

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,420
WordPress and that's what by next year

00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,940
we get 35 and the same progress today

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,440
you know so let's get that so what are

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,690
the what are the things that can happen

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,520
when you really get compromised so if

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,770
you run a business if you run a blog if

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,340
you run anything everything comes down

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,140
to reputation and you you have things

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,180
like search engine reputation you have

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,100
things like human reputation things like

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,990
machine learning reputation so all of

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,330
these things will contribute to whether

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,730
or not you are a reliable source for

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,670
information see Google sintra see google

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,680
says I'm not gonna I'm not gonna put you

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,380
up in the top ranks because you are we

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,260
have a lot of keywords I'm gonna put you

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,630
up because you have a reputation google

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,970
solve our reputation so if people visit

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,400
you so much to get you know let's say

00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,980
you're a photographer and you use fake

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,470
cough sorry use WordPress to put up the

00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,360
stuff there so if you keep giving good

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,470
for the graphic tip so how to change the

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,500
frame rates how to make

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,300
do that and people start to say oh he's

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,060
a very reliable or she's a very like a

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,620
sauce for photography information you

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,110
know so but then when you start to get

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,640
hacked and then malware starts to get in

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,190
and then people start to get infected

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,720
Google can completely block the art you

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,030
don't even have nothing to hide anymore

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,100
so that the implication will go right

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,220
now to your business it comes down to

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,810
economics so colleagues matter I was

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,700
just talking to a friend for me

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,860
yesterday she was from us and we're

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,490
talking about how to get politicians to

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,830
listen

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,630
the technology is by telling them what

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,490
the economy in fact is going to be

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:31,170
that's the only way to get to them

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,940
otherwise it will just when you tell

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,840
them it's gonna cost you two billion US

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,640
dollars per year

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,520
oh let's talk come to my room you know

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,860
so economy impact is is important and we

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,860
also approach in terms of security all

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,660
right reliability validity and so on so

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,710
forth I don't s is the blacklisting of

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,090
factor

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,770
check this off this is a interesting

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,080
statement that I wanna put out and

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,880
people should take note of each week

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,260
people like his twenty thousand sides

00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:05,310
from our fifty thousand for fishing

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:07,470
coefficient TC yeah so that

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,610
don't be part of that statistics you

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,880
know let's try and do something let's

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,490
see what we can do today in the next 35

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,840
minutes nine half so more statistics and

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,030
this fella very quickly run through that

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,040
and this is the one on the top right of

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,340
yours that's your statistics and

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,130
statistics show that more

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,380
50% of Online hacks are resulted from

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,330
websites websites not necessarily just

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,160
WordPress sites that you build from

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,230
scratch on frameworks we talk a lot more

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,140
able to sound PHP frameworks and so on

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,240
those other sites also had a particular

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,040
but if you focus and see who are the

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,590
biggest source of security

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,780
vulnerabilities that's gonna be our good

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:47,020
ol websites right if you look at the one

00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:50,020
below top right bottom that's the over W

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,060
OWC top 10 list of vulnerabilities and

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,160
this are so consistent I'll show you

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,050
some statistics on that as well so if

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,680
you look at products products that are

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,750
talked in the ranking of usage there is

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,180
a correlation this is pure pure

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,990
probability you know it works right if

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,520
you have 10 things if you have 10

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,440
possibly descent and each of those

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,230
possibilities represent a value let's

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,220
say if you go out as a possibility you

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:21,100
can have 10 people are 8 people with a

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,880
speak about for example coding and two

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,430
people are going to talk about

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,360
infrastructure in a such a mini security

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,540
that what I'm doing

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,920
8 people to talk to about coding so

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,830
there is a chance there's a higher

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,200
chance of you if you walk in line and

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,470
walk into a room you will probably hit

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,710
the higher likeliness of eating up going

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,810
to a talk that is more code base because

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,970
that's what probabilities is the numbers

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,100
matter so when you look at that and you

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,470
put that into context of WordPress for

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,510
example you will always have a high

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:57,250
number of security problems we relate to

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,920
as well as best not because it's so far

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,690
above that because it is so used it is

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,000
so used and therefore the probability

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,930
goes higher the simple mathematics would

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,430
be could ever have

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,930
so it's not necessarily it's more

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,930
vulnerable it's just that

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,970
that's more useless more statistics that

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,370
would be contributed the same goes with

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,500
Linux versus windows argument you know

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,510
because Windows is like 95% of the

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,870
world's population that use them more

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,550
like 90% and if you say what are the top

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,530
one abilities the windows always comes

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,780
up because that's we weren't stagnating

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,610
and if I'm a hacker if I have my hack

00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:35,020
there and I want to become famous who do

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:37,210
i target when I get ABC CMS or do I get

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,100
WordPress CMS see what I mean if I want

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,680
to be famous I target the famous parse

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,540
it how it goes and I get a famous

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,070
platform so that's how it works as

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,270
you're probably so that's why I'm

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,750
showing you some of that

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:52,630
popularly so have some operating systems

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,120
that you can that was you will see a lot

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,370
but equal to CP databases austerity

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,990
databases and find out I'm showing up

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:04,780
everywhere survives and if you look at

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,600
the statistics here this is zooming into

00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:14,440
WordPress itself by the CVE foundation

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:16,810
the CDC data base so basically they're

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,750
saying the biggest one is xxs cross-site

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:23,040
scripting so you know what that is

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,040
anyone who's not familiar with XSS

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,310
anyone's everyone familiar with

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,110
cross-site scripting it's actually a big

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,720
problem although it might not directly

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,900
it comes down to reputation cross-site

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,320
scripting it cut out reputation bringing

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,810
people into you give your users the

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,120
exposure it uses one expose one ability

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,750
to your user so that's important it does

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,640
like but number one top security problem

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:53,080
when it comes to WordPress according to

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,680
the CBE and so this is what's very

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,240
important that I was wrong and I want

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,100
you've got this as well so those

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,139
statistics basically mean that we have a

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,980
responsibility and it's real look at the

00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,809
statistics is real in 2018 and lowly

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Italian technical abilities are reported

00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:13,529
in CBE for WordPress WordPress so it is

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,179
a continuous battle for everyone all

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:17,910
parties and so on you know so it's not

00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:20,850
just not just the developers not

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,429
WordPress or guys it's also us that

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,649
actually helped to the table of

00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:28,170
statistics this is the one ability but

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,089
the amount of hacks coming from the one

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,679
ability is not only with this sometimes

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:36,199
some other one abilities probably would

00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:38,339
get disclosed so I come to this

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,230
statement I love this particular

00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,779
statement from Isaac Newton and he

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,179
didn't say but he repeats it says I have

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,829
seen further analysis by standing upon

00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,679
the shoulders of giants a beautiful say

00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:53,459
that says if we want to progress we use

00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:56,550
the success of people before us that's

00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:59,009
actually a very powerful ethos of open

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,459
source open source is built upon the

00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:05,939
success for example what is PHP language

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:09,329
anyone what is the web language for you

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:10,740
should perform for WordPress right so

00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,839
PHP is not developed by the WordPress

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,459
people who is to provide people to

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,709
develop PHP and PHP runs on web servers

00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,429
Apache right so a party is developed by

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,860
someone else

00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:24,029
what a party sits on sits on Linux

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,269
operating system of Windows

00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:29,269
of course Windows the spa

00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:36,240
so if you can see the success of

00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:39,569
everyone depends it's a fact you know so

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,779
the success moving forward makeup so

00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:47,160
WordPress is the same thing so we we see

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:49,350
the part the success statement so it is

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,509
a joint responsibility from all of us to

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:57,059
ensure that ok so let me very quickly go

00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:58,889
through this content the first thing is

00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,470
choose right choose right meaning you've

00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:05,040
got two options okay you've got hosted

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:08,209
you have some of your responses up there

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,449
and actually have a one click WordPress

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:14,879
deploy but you know like running or

00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:16,889
you've got some options to rabbit magnet

00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,370
or meaning you install it yourself I do

00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:22,379
both depends on what I wanna achieve if

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,689
I want it fast I will do it of course to

00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:28,620
be people like exercise but some people

00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:30,209
like us who are on cloud for example we

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,660
can actually just you know on a click of

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,299
a button

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,679
get your WordPress up running or if you

00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,360
are right you know sometimes you need to

00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,490
customize it further you wanna do with

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,740
your whole different way it might on

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,600
your own servers for example back the

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,160
office that it will have the Club

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,929
function you have a local department

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,790
function that you need to install it or

00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:49,709
scratch so each of them have their boots

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,269
and pants so I'm just going to jump

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,189
straight into the considerations and

00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,290
things that you should pay attention so

00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:56,639
when you're hosted you have to

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:01,019
understand that providers do not

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,809
necessarily care about you it is generic

00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,329
generic they care about the service they

00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,370
don't

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,470
application what you run on it they were

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,029
standing they will figure it out so

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,890
something years what is that but if you

00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,870
do it yourself there's a good chance you

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,529
are gonna take care of it so bear that

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,390
in mind

00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:18,789
providers will not give you extended

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,350
security well not if they probably give

00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,419
you a baseline security it's up to you

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,980
then to make it better

00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,459
they also shared resource or shared

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,169
resources is good and also extremely bad

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,000
this happened to our one of our

00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:32,890
customers and they actually put some of

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,700
the silver some very famous website

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:39,159
provider but his share so what happened

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,010
was this website provider had I think

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:44,620
about 15 sites running or so one of it

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,360
was another CMS which I'm not gonna

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,870
mention and that hit hand that got

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,860
hacked and he dropped a crypto minor for

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,960
the operating system

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,690
you know what did reminded us right it's

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,570
good us max are the cpu so what happens

00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,570
is every site contractor so just bear

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,139
that in mind if you run into a bigger

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,940
capacity

00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:06,010
you wanna run to biggest capacity maybe

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,870
start to the power of share posting so

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,760
share hosting means share of the good

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:14,889
things but more importantly to remember

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,659
it's also sharing the bad stuff okay so

00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:18,399
that's another problem also that's like

00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:19,710
shared hosting we all know that and that

00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,610
is difficult to do reverse

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,809
functionalities because they would allow

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,870
you to because it share

00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:27,010
you're not exclusive to that server you

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,990
share it with other people

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,200
okay so you don't have customized stuff

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,730
that I will mention in my slice on

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,620
security that you might not have posted

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:41,590
virus so here's another very positive on

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,149
that is hosted guys likely do not

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,770
maintain your site they just maintain

00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:46,050
yes

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,550
they maintain what they provide they

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,100
will not maintain your site so you need

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,890
to actively do it so it's do not rely on

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:56,880
posting people to secure the site alone

00:18:52,890 --> 00:19:00,030
you have to actively do it yourself the

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,620
other side by Mentos it can be quite

00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,840
trivial to make mistakes so if you're

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,020
not familiar do not only not so it's not

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,390
no deployment of clean up zombie no

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,460
systems then this might not be the rough

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,590
for you the bigger thing that you need

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,620
to consider is when you deploy if you

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,870
don't understand the risk of you causing

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,510
something security problem is higher

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:24,090
then you go to the postal provider which

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,530
has some level of security so if I had

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,870
to compare if you do not have knowledge

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,510
if you are still learning I would still

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:34,230
go to shadows they provided okay this is

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,850
to set that very clearly the difficulty

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,080
level does it higher as you start

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,350
installing and if you run into problems

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,150
with yourself as opposed to using for

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,780
example Class C panel provider it just

00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:49,890
backs and off you go

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,809
yes I'm sorry so you maintaining into

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,100
all levels also so not for not to forget

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,750
when you are the chat posting

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,370
environment you just met it WordPress

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,750
right but if you are in a awkward

00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,460
environment you might tell you what

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,059
resume take a firewall the maintenance

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,250
of operating system your databases and

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:08,250
your web server so you are actively

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,260
maintaining ecosystem side so you need

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,000
to have some knowledge of all of them I

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,650
do probably say you need to have a super

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,530
thick knowledge but if you have some

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,840
knowledge

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,920
that entire thing that you are giving

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,000
you - you're satisfied so that's a

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,620
spider-man statement with great power

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,410
comes great responsibility which means

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,480
since you have good access of assume you

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,710
build yourself you have good access it

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,990
means you have also a real

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,800
responsibility to make sure that you do

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:38,770
not you know mess exactly very powerful

00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,690
across okay so after you done our

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,480
installation I recommend you to try one

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,280
of these this is stuff that I'm

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,650
recommending it's not necessarily the

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,420
best this is stuff that I used so that I

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,170
can only recommend things that I forget

00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,730
already bit

00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,080
I can recommend things that I've used

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,640
these are the things I used not

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,680
necessarily the best said not

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
necessarily promoting any but these are

00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,630
the stuff I use if you have not done

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,600
this so it's not on them already

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,550
please mmediately trying to deploy them

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,830
at the end of the session going to the

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,650
wordpress marketplace look for items for

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:14,050
example is solid and do some scans to

00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:18,190
make sure that whether mostly provider

00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:20,020
or your deployment is good insecure the

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,150
next thing is authentication publication

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,580
is what is authentication everyone will

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:27,610
think of passwords obviously right so

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,470
what press has many plugins to introduce

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,590
something called to form factor what is

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,180
to perfecter there are multiple factors

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,430
when it comes certification something

00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,560
you know which is your password

00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:41,800
something that is U which is biometrics

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,960
and something that is that is for

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,440
example that is markup okay so these

00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,390
three options when you do to come to

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,340
more factor authentication so instead of

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,870
just providing a password I am also

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,750
going to send you a tag

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,790
everyone's use online banking before why

00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,280
does it require you to get a tag when

00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,220
you do a transfer that's only because

00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,720
it's an earlier

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,030
yes you're pretty logged in to me back

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,380
to you for example or whatever but if

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,630
you want to start to do actual

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,790
transaction if you know somebody you ask

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,710
for a tech so that it's an additional

00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,290
layer of security so if you've not done

00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:18,900
that already today go and enable

00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:21,360
two-factor authentication for admin

00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,200
accounts at least okay that would just

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,760
eliminate something called enforcing

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,730
attacks and it's already gonna eliminate

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:34,560
a lot of possible people trying to guess

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:36,300
passwords use complex complex and long

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,310
passwords I gotta keep it up on a play

00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,330
with you so that's something to do hit

00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,070
that sighs so a white be a really common

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,410
admin users I'm not a big fan of this

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:50,790
but this is so not true you see what

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:52,890
happens is I would say 98% of the reason

00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,140
why people find one of those sites is

00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:57,840
because people use default settings

00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,480
default setting means my admin user is

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,180
actually calling me and my database is

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,100
actually called WP underscore all the

00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,860
tables are called so it's easy to guess

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,600
so the people who actually want to look

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,060
for you are not humans they actually

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,920
machines they are status and when the

00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,140
scanner find something interesting about

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,870
your site that is using defaults you

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,990
will be the first to get hacked okay

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,880
unless you are for example you run a

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,890
combination see for example and somebody

00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,990
wants to make an active effort to hack

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,750
you then you will have human doing it

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,310
but there's a good chance that most of

00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,850
the hacks you see today with WordPress

00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:38,430
or any other CMS is using bombs it's

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,860
actually just scan an entire IT rage and

00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,810
that was one ago it's like for example I

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,830
used to give this example I which showed

00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:48,810
online I put a server onto the test and

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,550
I plug it the internet it was less than

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,890
twenty minutes somebody was trying to

00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,510
enforce my association less than twenty

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,300
minutes that's how fast the sparks were

00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,160
and it just scared and keeps can keep

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,770
standing so don't be part of the easy

00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,789
pass don't let that mean because don't

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,070
make it easy

00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:07,229
so try to change the name that it's also

00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,389
a plug-in to do that okay don't do it

00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:12,029
through the database go ahead and modify

00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:15,119
it yourself do it through a plug-in okay

00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:17,309
it's a safe way to do it and try to

00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,929
change the admin URL how many of you

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:22,440
let's be honest here how many of you

00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:23,849
still use WP - at me yeah okay try to

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,349
change that that's also applying it

00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:29,759
because why like I say it becomes a

00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:32,999
commonality but no all right so let me

00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,709
fetch WB at me right so you open up you

00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:37,769
make it easy for that security it's not

00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:39,299
a silver bullet security is supposed to

00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:41,549
be something to make it harder for

00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:43,619
people to get into your system it's not

00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:45,419
going to prevent it 100% if somebody

00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:46,979
tells you this they have a product that

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,109
can prevent security they're probably

00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:51,059
just like there's no such thing it's a

00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:53,519
matter of time before it gets broken but

00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,759
our job is to make it hard for somebody

00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,759
to

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,630
so change the admin login URL you can

00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,690
okay

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,770
and salts everyone familiar with hashing

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,600
and how Saltzburg

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,880
should i just quickly go to what that

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,220
means hashing is a process of taking the

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,520
text like say my name is Sanjay that's a

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,530
text and I put it on to our presentation

00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,419
you can read it therefore it is visible

00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,190
hashing is a process of putting in

00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:32,590
traditional thoughts on top of it that

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,409
it becomes unreadable to machine or

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,840
human unless you know the password then

00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:40,990
you use the hashing algorithm to match

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,539
so what happens is with hash even if

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:46,960
somebody downloads the passwords and

00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:49,419
this I'm telling you that is this very

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,909
famous movie website obviously you know

00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:55,299
that's what it to one of them literally

00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:58,179
still today 2018 lo and behold still

00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,289
store passwords in three attacks I'm not

00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:00,909
going to go there but you don't use

00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:04,780
WordPress by the way they built it

00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:08,470
themselves but that's not freak freak us

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,230
out but if you use passwords visible if

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,059
somebody gets a copy of the database

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,740
passwords are visible and there's a good

00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:17,470
chance that password is also going to be

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,049
used from enough to another site like

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,340
for example I'm pretty sure some how

00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:23,260
many of you them it must be obvious how

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,990
many of us reuse passwords more than one

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,150
site we do this effect so the problem is

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,669
when you have a least secure password

00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,510
assign that same password can then be

00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:34,690
used somewhere else

00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,130
see what I mean so you not obviously

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,650
your bank password is secure because

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,630
you've got people they don't take care

00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,669
of security but you also put the same

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,950
password for another side same username

00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:47,220
would say password and it's not a secure

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,950
site it's not not for example that

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,690
about right and somebody has said they

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,130
connected to try it likes us different

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,710
types of website by guessing what other

00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,360
places you might be visiting the first

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,340
thing I would do is try and use Gmail

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,980
the second thing I will do is try to use

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,380
hotmail or some other common services

00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,640
that everyone likely to use so be

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,680
careful with that okay

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,110
has she basically encrypts that writes

00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,780
it away so salt is the process of adding

00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:18,040
more complexity to it adding more

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:20,470
complexity to the encryption so you

00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,300
seventy per the password policy enable

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:27,790
HTTPS this is something you are familiar

00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:29,590
with I guess and some of the okay quick

00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,520
question which is for secure who says

00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:35,550
one pressure head which password is more

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,500
is better

00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,940
number three who says number Hussein

00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,710
Obama's face the head who says number

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,930
one who says number two raise your hand

00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:47,770
who says number three raise your hand

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:50,950
okay the answer is number two yes it

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:53,500
will take a few billion years to crack

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:57,300
that password but you see you see check

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,300
this out right which password is easier

00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,960
but number two diseases remembers

00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,490
attacks so the thing is the number three

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,810
is you will not remember I guess what

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,810
you will do most people's

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,179
on your hand behind your skin so that so

00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,860
it's actually because people think that

00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:23,600
the last words always a secure ones fun

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,940
but two is more secure it is

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,610
computationally more people far more

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,730
difficult to break the number tree game

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,170
over on transitionally so but I have to

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,660
speed up a bit into the Tigers right

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:38,000
shot but it's important for you to also

00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:41,300
body on it your site and use these

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,340
plugins again ten firewalls on 10x has

00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,630
lots on Xbox is who logged in and what

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,490
time they log in and stuff like that so

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,410
all of these plugins do already have

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,440
that we just check box and hable that

00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,630
off you go gos your fencing for help in

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,559
folders that you can actually say I will

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,910
only allow WP admin to a certain region

00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,440
for example systemization

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,960
you can just omit that in fact one of

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,760
the things that I did our system system

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,890
ie me because I don't have customers

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,290
also ovulation I just limit my wordpress

00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:12,890
site population why do I need to surpass

00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:14,809
someone outside so geofencing house okay

00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,830
you reduce your actor attack vector your

00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:17,929
size for your time

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,030
quality coding I cannot stress this

00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:22,400
enough now when people write plugins at

00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:24,470
Thebes and so on please follow our best

00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,140
guidelines I know some of you watched a

00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,520
brilliant speech by and on radar this

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,520
morning and he was talking about how to

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,700
make business for WordPress so it's our

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,290
responsibility as persons do this

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,929
blankets at themes to follow guidelines

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40,429
and you also body your good because it

00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,890
is our responsibility when somebody

00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:47,110
expose it they will not inherit the

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:50,330
security that you do or don't do okay

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,490
white side loading of plugins I one guy

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,520
said oh you know I can get theme for us

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,350
for our themes for free if I go to this

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,179
one particular website I wouldn't do

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,580
that if I were you because somebody

00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:03,770
could inject code that actually could

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:07,490
track stuff talk about the password so

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:10,039
decrypt the password site send them to

00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:13,340
telemetry you connect back to their

00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:15,289
title server so use proper deep sites do

00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,840
not cycle that do not do anything funny

00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:21,470
like that try and use the ones from the

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:26,720
marketplace okay that's that's quality

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:29,419
coding okay so I am prevention is also

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,390
important spam but another block can

00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:34,760
literally reduce your Google ranking so

00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,500
pay attention to any spending okay try

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,500
to put an anti-spam product Leela so

00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,480
these are some of the sample products

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,700
that you can plug in see can use to

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,429
prevent spam and also all the other

00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,120
things that I've mentioned there

00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:48,980
monitoring and visibility

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,650
although monitoring is technically not

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,679
security but what is security security

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:57,289
also one of the things of the site's

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,419
data breach it's also availability of

00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:01,820
your site if your site is not online

00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,530
it could mean it is a block or it could

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,809
mean it got hacked so one of the states

00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:08,539
so it's important for us to go or you to

00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:10,429
know us know that you know to Nomad our

00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,500
website is running right now so like for

00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:15,260
example I ask you right now how many of

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,039
you 100% confident you like a site is

00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:21,700
running right now not by chance not by

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,390
chance not bioody is running but by fact

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:27,340
that's what if one person always

00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,620
less than 10 so put on monitoring guys

00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:32,430
as plugins available put on monitoring

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:35,500
if your site has a problem it will have

00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:38,170
email sent up to you or you can use a

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,750
third-party site I will show you if you

00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:43,270
don't know I smell some links on three

00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,280
sides and actually give you free

00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:48,520
monitoring of your website so if your

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,170
website is inaccessible together okay

00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,490
it's important to keep your site up and

00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,670
running this is part of security

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,290
monitoring is part of security and here

00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,730
are some of the plugins he had used so

00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,500
if something is wrong with the side it

00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,270
goes down you can actually use one of

00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,030
these plugins will inform you that a

00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,760
site is down you are the same side these

00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:16,210
guys do perfectly fine this is power the

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:20,460
same site a pace amazingly enough since

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:22,390
36 to log body that is close to 80%

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,520
WordPress sites that are still using

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:29,860
widget to agree no kidding and this is

00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,920
huge it just brings all kinds of

00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,690
thousand likes imagine but that's the

00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,370
fact of life do your bits and where do

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,950
you find your updates it's so simple in

00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,110
WordPress you have that icon that pops

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,510
up right on the left side that says one

00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,250
update and please click and do the

00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,930
updates

00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,490
you have to make your site fancier it

00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,570
make

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,720
they're meant to make the site more

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,429
functional and more secure

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,309
but you do have occurrences where you

00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:58,919
have big updates like version 4 to 5 and

00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:00,630
5 scale be released soon so you might

00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,520
not wanna do big updates you want to do

00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,809
it on your test site first and then if

00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:08,909
you're comfortable or production design

00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:10,169
so some of the plugins that can help of

00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:11,970
course you have the WordPress dashboard

00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,970
itself which should tell you some things

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,470
that you know some teams or plugins or

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,390
WordPress itself needs an update

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,450
ok will flag it out it will show you

00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:23,100
already a like and of course if you are

00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:26,210
running your own service you need to

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:29,100
update Windows Update have get updates

00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:31,380
so auditing your site this is this is

00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,990
quite new a lot of you a lot of people

00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,210
offering the sound with internally from

00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,130
the plug-in store or from external they

00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,409
can actually scan your site to see if

00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,390
there's anyone abilities so these

00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:45,090
include free service providers and also

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:48,149
some paid paid one so I would suggest

00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:52,860
considering both it's as easy as putting

00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:56,700
in Google WordPress security scanner or

00:33:52,860 --> 00:34:00,179
putting in Bing Google putting in Bing

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,590
or WordPress WordPress you discover and

00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:04,679
look at some of the options and free

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:07,140
ones that come out ok recommendations as

00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,540
well but these are these are meant more

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,230
for local scanning which means my scan

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,879
myself from the WordPress itself there's

00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,740
good and bad of this but I would still

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,750
recommend me to do it another problem

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,450
which means you do local scans using the

00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:24,210
plugins and also an external standard

00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:27,270
moving very swiftly this is this is big

00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:30,690
I thought I've got people literally

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,850
they literally cried and call me at 2:00

00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:37,399
a.m. on Sunday when I'm you know I had a

00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:42,389
bit of drinks by it means like my makeup

00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:44,899
by conscience I've got just means I

00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:50,210
cannot even hear the phone ring

00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:52,530
seriously people call me and huge

00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:56,700
everyone knows what business someone

00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:59,250
needs to clarify what a tus is make it

00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,740
simple for you your website runs on port

00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:04,650
80 for example or four for three HTTP

00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,630
HTTPS right so a legitimate request is

00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,910
going the response and I access your

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,490
WordPress site HTTP response back with

00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:14,040
the data HTTP response type in the data

00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:17,310
so the distributed denial of service

00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,980
attack sends thousands of requests to

00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:22,110
your site causing your site to respond

00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,150
to the attacker rather than to your

00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:26,430
customer or to your people who paid

00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,540
through your website so a distributed

00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,630
denial of service is actually a

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,880
legitimate access but decide to stop

00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,340
religion people to access your site so

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,410
what do you do my easiest advice is

00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:40,850
unplug the cable but you know we can do

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,850
much more so there are things like

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,400
anti-ddos options that you can use

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:49,500
something like soap fly something you

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,290
can start to do it's free and they have

00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,040
built us protection so who rather get

00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,390
explore fly at the end of this problem

00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,200
if you will to press the site is part of

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:03,210
your pocket it makes money for you to

00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,299
consider putting it into flash so some

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:08,069
of the examples EWS as you

00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:10,410
some other providers as well maybe

00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:13,109
exercises are not sure exactly but they

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,179
might have anti DDoS protection okay

00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:16,859
consider using them called flies the

00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,999
easiest to do you just modified it here

00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:20,099
and as it takes a bit of secret

00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:24,359
knowledge of how to do that but you know

00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:26,130
there's super step by step guys now me

00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,839
tell you very quickly running to them I

00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,309
think you you know these things you are

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,029
very familiar with this thing turn on

00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:37,289
firewalls no option ids/ips is an option

00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:39,089
in system detection system antivirus not

00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:41,969
only that's even on Macs by the way

00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:46,529
putting antivirus anti-malware because

00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:48,599
you have things like click to expire and

00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:50,670
software that can come and crack hello

00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,259
because they don't care about operating

00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,259
system they actually scripts that run

00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:56,609
and execute code from your laptop using

00:36:55,259 --> 00:37:02,309
your life permits that we source to

00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:04,529
generate you slope ellipsis if you can

00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:06,660
Club flies an example of software based

00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:09,299
load balancer once you'd be or plug let

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,309
your half of the CDN export distribution

00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:14,039
network which is worldwide so you're not

00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:15,660
limited to a certain like you could your

00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:17,759
server with the emulation but if you

00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,589
deploy 12 lakh and you're so is that

00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:21,509
replicated and I'm putting it in a

00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:21,809
simple cell replicated throughout the

00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:24,929
world

00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:27,209
I'm also done so to wrapping it up to to

00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:28,709
wrap it up let's just go back very

00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:31,439
quickly suppose one minute

00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:31,949
let's be kept so first thing is spot

00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:33,479
right

00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,069
just what I've provided or choose

00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:36,959
whether you want to do it yourself to

00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:40,349
ensure you have things like two for

00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:42,210
multiplication three ensure that even

00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:45,420
after you've done that you have

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,220
turn on and fall make sure you when you

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,589
do Cody especially developers quote

00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,380
following what best guidelines

00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:53,490
5 make sure you do have some money

00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,250
trickling I told you they have free

00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:58,109
tools on site on under WordPress plug-in

00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,450
itself or a third-party tool that you

00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,950
can use to scan ok so then they will

00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,260
send you an email if your site's down

00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,240
backup and restore again the key word

00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,210
here is restored on back up awareness

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,770
back up and testing responds well to

00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,450
updates do updates of course that's the

00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,550
easiest one everyone I think hopefully

00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,830
does that and if you have colleagues or

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:22,320
friends who do not rely on please stop

00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:24,990
them on the toilet on your site are free

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,510
tools of that that's one for these guys

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:33,359
for my company's philosophy too we can

00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:35,720
go ahead and decide is do something

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,460
level of distributed denial-of-service

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,070
prevention things like buffer and of

00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,930
course your local security with that

00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,730
here are the links don't write that down

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,930
we can download the slugs or prosecute

00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,369
fine and these are really good for

00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,680
secure than all of them to make sure

00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:54,480
it's really relevant and easy to use for

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,950
our team ok and special mentions these

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,520
are their external monitoring they was

00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,560
telling you about

00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,820
you can use them for free again nobody

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,330
wanna keep it just guys you can talk

00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,330
about the slides

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:10,349
so with that I hope we all consider

00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,270
security is part of our responsibilities

00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:14,430
not an option I hope is not an option I

00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:17,110
hope at the end of this talk you do one

00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:20,890
of the very things and

00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,890
the community too

00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:27,090
