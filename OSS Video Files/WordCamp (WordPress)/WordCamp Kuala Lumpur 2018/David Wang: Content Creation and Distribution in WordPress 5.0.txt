Title: David Wang: Content Creation and Distribution in WordPress 5.0
Publication date: 2019-05-13
Playlist: WordCamp Kuala Lumpur 2018
Description: 
	A new age of WordPress is upon us, and a better way to create and distribute rich content has (finally) arrived.
For far too long, WordPress content has been encapsulated within a box, having to rely on shortcodes, TinyMCE plugins and other hacks in order to create captivating experiences.
Now, with Gutenberg and WordPress 5.0, all of this changes. No longer are content creators required to conform to the limitations of the box; instead, these writers now have a blank canvas on which to explore their ideas as they create content, much the same way a painter ideates through a masterpiece.

okay great so I see and we will stock is

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,430
very good competition but yeah alright

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,610
so today I want to tell you about what's

00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,610
coming in WordPress 5.0 and WordPress

00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,460
5.0 is next II just around the corner it

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,380
is the tripi like two weeks away so

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,390
originally they have planned to release

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:34,280
it on Monday by the 19th but there were

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,710
computer delays so they pushed it back a

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,450
little bit and I'm sure it's gonna be

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,190
out by the end of the year so this I

00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:45,500
hope is really relevant and really

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:47,750
timely okay so this is releasing on one

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,730
of the organizers for the webcam I

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:56,750
didn't expect it to be on stage today

00:00:51,730 --> 00:01:00,649
but and I put this stuff together in one

00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:03,640
day so hopefully this bear be if it's

00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,640
not perfect all right

00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:24,789
you know what this thing is going on

00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:27,460
okay okay so I'm my internet nickname is

00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:30,520
blob jockey back then you know blocks of

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,450
everything but now Rockstar not

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,450
completely anymore

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,679
so when Facebook young is mistaken so

00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,539
I'm the block the cop I run a company

00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:42,939
called victim will be and we provide

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:45,610
work respect support for vloggers and

00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:48,399
small business owners all right I know

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,520
what pressure is a for a long time I

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,049
also helped organize the KL WordPress

00:01:51,520 --> 00:02:00,189
meetup that the ring he was talking

00:01:53,049 --> 00:02:02,200
about and and that's it so I have got a

00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,989
few slides like this so if you want to

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,179
share something from my talk prompt you

00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,410
give us light like this and hashtag this

00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,230
means that you know again it's not a

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:14,290
picture and put it on Twitter Instagram

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:18,370
with the hashtag right and here's an

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,410
example it's like WordPress 5.0 will

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:28,090
introduce a big change to the post

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:29,920
editor okay so that's the post edit that

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,620
I'm talking about is you know where you

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,250
go to write new post you know add a new

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,550
page or a new product and that's the

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,260
posted each other

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:45,260
using for the past 10 years so what

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,690
pressed 5.0 when you upgrade and then

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,370
you could add a new course you will see

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,130
something completely different

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:55,520
all right and I'm telling you so that

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,860
you will get a big shock and get upset

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,170
with the big change

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:04,190
all right that this post editor the new

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,800
host editor is called Guttenberg okay so

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:11,020
as nicknamed Guttenberg we've put much

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:15,980
trust speak about Guttenberg today and

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:18,770
basically Gutenberg is a code name when

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,200
we didn't WordPress the one referred

00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,610
witness we've been work but you hear

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,590
people talking about the Guttenberg

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,470
editor but the official name will

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:32,750
actually be the new post editor or maybe

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:35,780
even block editor all right so here's

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:39,800
the post editor that we all know then we

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,690
love or we love to hate and when you

00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:47,660
upgrade to WordPress 9.0 we will change

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:50,060
to this okay so it looks different and

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,990
it also works with you differently and

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm going to attempt a life

00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,150
you guys stay there okay but before that

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,180
it's a step back for us and talk a bit

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,620
about you know what's the problem with

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,920
the edit though why do we need to update

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,110
this edit this okay so in a difficult

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,850
blog post or a web page today you know

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:15,810
what text plain text is not enough text

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:20,010
and images is minor and we increasingly

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:22,110
wanna put rich media into our blog posts

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,050
and pages so we've got audio and video

00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:28,980
that's pretty easy with soft but easily

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,170
you can embed content from YouTube and

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,640
then content in South LA and actually I

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:37,770
can you can embed content from Twitter

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,260
or Facebook but then things get more

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,330
complicated maybe you have tables you

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,700
know tables you know two columns you're

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,170
an admin button do you know how

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,360
difficult is to add a button in

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,640
WordPress you know you gotta install

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,090
plugin because beforehand you can add a

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,460
button to the WordPress post editor

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,620
sometimes post code snippets you know

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,560
for those who wanna share code like you

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:05,390
know W on technical like Lorna when I

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,600
share code snippets and then

00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,010
testimonials if you have a business

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,010
website and you want to tell you had a

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,920
page of happy clients so I'm gonna have

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,260
some testimonials if business websites

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,590
typically also have our team members

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:25,620
about us and you know about David about

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,870
really about Sam's or you may also want

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,680
to have outlets locations where you can

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,070
find

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,590
better meth into your post or page right

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,770
and then also some other things bail

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,220
services like accordions tabs true in

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,160
height and stuff like that okay and and

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,810
you know the thing is s we want to add

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,330
my more rich media it gets more

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,580
complicated and then new people who come

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,699
to WordPress feel that you know why is

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,490
it so fun we need it and to prove my

00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,919
point do you know that adding

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,620
testimonials to WordPress it's the most

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,419
complicated thing ever okay because you

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,050
would think that adding a testimonial is

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:09,570
simpler you just some text and image the

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,370
name of the first set and started a bit

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:15,440
and they overlooked okay

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,440
but in reality there are so many steps

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,639
first of all you gotta go find a good

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,009
plugin alright so then you have to spend

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,410
time googling which is the best plugin

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,910
reviews of the plugin you find all the

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,509
spam in the Google results you know

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,340
who's we friends better and I like this

00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:35,699
plug-in called strong testimonials oh

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,470
yeah after many many hours of research

00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,960
new plugins I decided strong

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,729
testimonials is the best plug-in but you

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,889
can then you know it still a lot of

00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:47,310
steps you gotta install the the

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,409
testimonial and then when let's say I'm

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,169
on the services page and on about the

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,749
testimony

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,479
services page I still can do it I got

00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:57,580
going to create new testimony office

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,340
create new testimonial and then add the

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,849
testimonial to a group and then make a

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,680
short quote for the group and then after

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,979
that I go back to the original services

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,229
page put the shortcode in there and then

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,729
I have to preview and change the

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:14,740
settings preview and then change the

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,419
settings before I can get the

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,240
testimonial looking the way to have one

00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:20,949
so for new WordPress users there's a lot

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,169
of concepts here they have to first of

00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,509
all understand what is a plug-in I have

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,400
to install plugin how do I stop again

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,189
Oh laughter I am so extremely to click

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,219
activate you know what I can already

00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:35,529
install my do anything activity is not

00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:38,710
there not that you have to order it the

00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:40,419
user has to read that I want it I want

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,039
to add a testimony to this stage but

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,620
actually I could create a testimonial on

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,960
another page first and then I have to

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,969
know what is the shock cord so a lot a

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,099
lot of steps I tell you creating

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,099
testimonials in WordPress is at crisis

00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:59,229
okay so here's where I do it demo and

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:03,750
I'm going to show you how easy it is or

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,750
how relatively easy this decree

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,740
testimonial wave Gutenberg

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,520
okay

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:48,290
okay so what i'm doing here i'm creating

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:51,079
a pitch call plans and so here's the

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:58,009
basically this is the the gutenberg

00:08:51,079 --> 00:09:00,019
editor it's included book we use the

00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:04,579
concept of blocks so every piece of

00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:06,980
content on the page is a block so if i'm

00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:10,569
typing this year is paragraph it's

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,569
actually a block okay

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,910
and you can you can move blocks up and

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:24,029
now by clicking the buttons like this or

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:29,970
you can drag and drop them that okay

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:33,569
blocks have a sentence okay so okay you

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,369
can change the alignment alright and at

00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:39,959
the site here you have you more settings

00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:43,920
you can change the text size you can add

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:47,480
the drop cap okay and you have color

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,989
settings and change the background color

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:55,739
and you will change the text color okay

00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:57,749
so this is not this this is just an

00:09:55,739 --> 00:10:00,209
overview of how the blocks system works

00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:02,459
in Guttenberg alright so just nice it

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:05,249
creating testimonials just a lot easier

00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:08,129
so let's see how that works first you

00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:09,360
can click the add a block but then and

00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:15,079
then I'm going to search for

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,079
testimonials alright so

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,589
and I can whip my knee

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,590
and I can also upload an image

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,850
[Music]

00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,850
so I don't have

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,550
I don't have a I didn't I didn't plan

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:49,620
that image so I just used a random one

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:52,410
here okay that means work and and that's

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,870
it so now we have got testimonial and

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,730
it's right there a page I didn't have to

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,290
inhabit testimonials first and I didn't

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,060
have to figure out short codes and stuff

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,790
like that it's right and a big and

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,000
because this is a questionable block it

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:09,890
has built-in settings I can even change

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,440
the font size I can change the alignment

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:19,530
and I can change the background color

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:22,620
okay yes our webcam green right so yeah

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,360
a beautiful it's a bit rough around a

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,050
just an alignment here is not perfect

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,750
but I think you can see how creating

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,560
something like testimonials is a lot

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,970
simpler compared to the previous card

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,390
I'm using short course and stuff like

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,390
that okay

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:49,010
I can duplicate the truck both and

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,010
that's a job a lot easier as well

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,920
and great thing about Wittenberg is that

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,410
you can add additional blocks okay so I

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,020
show you maybe just had a quick look at

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,600
Gutenberg and we had a look at a text

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,180
block and then we saw testimonials block

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,790
but you can have all sorts of blocks by

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,160
installing plugins okay so you stopped

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,590
liking to enable additional blocks so

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,000
for example you can add a accordion

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:30,370
block tabs block you can insert a block

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,700
for github just go show that on your web

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:36,100
page and right now the way that it works

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:40,630
is that you can stop plug-in and you you

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:43,800
will enable multiple blocks what more

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,990
than one block so you can have like

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,450
installed a comic looks like in they

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:54,610
will add like ten you gloss to

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:58,390
Guttenberg now the blocks can be pretty

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,400
powerful as well okay because so here's

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:04,990
an example or something that the good

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:08,140
network plugin can do Google has got

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,700
this Rich Snippets okay so sometimes

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,400
when you do it with search to Google

00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,320
then you will see

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,260
result like this instead of the regular

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,210
search results it shows you the image

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,700
and then the information right there in

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:25,120
the search results so this is this is

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:28,690
called a rich snippet now to do a rich

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,240
snippet requires quite a bit of custom

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,300
HTML code you've got specifically I

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,630
think you have the right json-ld that's

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,960
the format that Google expects now you

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,760
know regular people and even myself to

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,300
be honest I have no idea where json-ld

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,640
is okay and but thankfully you know if

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,970
you use the use as your blog in the

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:56,260
Yoast SEO plug-in installs is how to

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,560
block and how to block basically you end

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,900
a block and then you can create steps

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,300
and then you can add a plan in it for

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,950
the block you can edit image to each

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:11,970
step and you it will output the

00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:16,120
information to the could have a page as

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:18,910
a hub as how to it steps like this but

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,250
it will also create the json-ld code

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,270
that Google needs will be stay a rich

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,940
snippet again

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:28,810
so basically Guttenberg helps you with

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:33,550
your SEO as well or can help you as you

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:34,890
as well so to summarize every piece of

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,230
content in the new

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,200
that is a block right and you can add

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,090
more blocks via plugins blocks will

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,630
become the language of WordPress and

00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:48,510
could even replace widgets okay so one

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:51,930
thing I would love small businesses and

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:54,240
bloggers and one thing that that a lot

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,160
that struggle to understand is that okay

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,310
if you want to edit this time at the

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,290
beach you have the use go to a post edit

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,600
pages and so on you're gonna and in this

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,520
file page you have to use widgets for

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,410
the appearance widgets and the bottom of

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,810
the page is also appearance widgets so

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,670
it's like they have to and this they

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:17,130
have to understand a lot of these other

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:19,410
extra concepts so but with Guttenberg

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,920
the blocks become the language of

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,840
WordPress and instead of adding or

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,570
widget to the sidebar you can actually

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,070
add a block to the sidebar and I'm

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,200
saying this this is the future that is

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:35,280
what a plan this is from the Guttenberg

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:40,770
handbook it there are planets and in

00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:43,770
fact my mother has already also shared

00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,270
some ideas about that okay so the new

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,520
handbook says it is very possible for

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,130
Wittenberg to grow beyond the confines

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,990
of course engaged content to include the

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,300
whole page including everything that

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,190
surrounds the content and Men otherwise

00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:01,170
has said with this one you know out of

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:03,840
his own mouth that when WordPress uses

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,540
the block concept for widgets uses the

00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,480
block NSF for menus and then everything

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,670
becomes a lot simpler when

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,339
and I said all they need to know it just

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,690
kinda said how blocks were blocks you

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,519
added to the page and then their

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:20,839
settings on the side and then after that

00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,850
you can change the content for the main

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,320
content this was a site backpack that

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:30,230
they can do so here's a bit of a break

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:36,709
but we're pressed 5.0 will have the most

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:40,940
advanced content editor and a web okay

00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:46,519
and I just for some fun here's blogger

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:49,130
all right the blogger is very it looks

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,190
similar to the existing post editor in

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,170
WordPress but blogger blogger science is

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,420
very easy to get a formatting wrong like

00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:00,079
for example it went like this

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:03,889
extra small text here and I got the

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:07,790
tweet here doesn't appear the tweet here

00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:13,250
and and blogger is just a headache this

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:15,860
is medium medium medium and it is a very

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,079
nice experience for writing by a square

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,850
with the just erecting okay you cannot

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,480
add a lot more blocks yeah

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:28,549
they have you can add videos you can add

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,970
images you can add embeds but that's

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,029
about it you know

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,940
and testimonial you can add how to stuff

00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:38,100
myself like I mentioned you can add a

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,279
party in show and hide you can add tabs

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,529
with with medium I didn't check our wigs

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,820
so does anybody know if weeks and

00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:52,799
wouldn't work no no no weeks fans yeah

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:56,009
right good okay and I mean with the book

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,340
is so potentially powerful that other

00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:02,100
CMS is also looking to integrate with

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,740
Murphy right so Drupal is one of the

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,809
competitors the WordPress and you know

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,169
it they are trying to use with network

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:13,049
in side refer so what began as a

00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:15,389
WordPress project another competitor is

00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:19,590
like hey that's a great year let's train

00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:21,720
music - so I don't think it's really

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,120
bragging to say that WordPress has the

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,730
most content most half-opened at any

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,909
time but you know okay

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:34,830
really maybe I'm getting a little too

00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:39,169
excited right and it's true it's true

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:42,240
because before we are in the world of

00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:43,379
blocks and everything is so easy and

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,000
then we are so empowered

00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:48,419
there's going to be quite a few

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,340
challenges to overcome all right so

00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:53,639
coming to WordPress 500 in about two

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,159
weeks you get a new blog editor you have

00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:58,490
to learn that you Oprah you have to

00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,629
learn to do things differently you have

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,120
incompatibility with themes and plugins

00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:06,070
you have missing features and possible

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,690
bugs and you have frustration

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:14,170
for you in the next two weeks thank you

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:16,840
very much that's my presentation it's

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,180
not all that bad so there's this present

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,030
promise to deliver so here's some

00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:25,020
example of those problems yet so this

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:27,270
one here is the theme for esteem and

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,250
with the work is broken

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:32,610
listen here to select the sidebar is at

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,700
the top and as big as this space here

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:38,620
and then you have stuff like this

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,630
updating fear Club flag is blocking the

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:45,790
rest API request those new I've never

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:47,680
seen em last week and so like I said the

00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:51,370
transition you know it's not going to be

00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,410
smooth sailing or just the transition

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,580
may not be smooth sailing it can be

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,990
smooth sailing right if you pay

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:03,460
attention for the next five minutes in

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:05,050
heaven so saving so the so this there's

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,850
two main points out that to tell you in

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,710
this talk the first main point is that a

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,100
big change is coming and the second

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,360
point is how to prepare okay so I think

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,680
it's relative I think it's quite easy

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:21,070
how to prepare whatever the first thing

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,530
to do is to try googling work now so

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,840
that you know how effect website okay

00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,650
and the way that you can track you can

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,780
book now if you go and install a plugin

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:34,600
you gotta add plugins you type in

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,370
Gutenberg and then you click install and

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,040
then after I don't forget to click

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,970
activate as well alright so that will

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,800
now installed within work on your

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,360
website even and then you have we can

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,820
work on your website even though it's

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,120
not yet we were pressed by my home okay

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,970
so this gives you an idea this should

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,520
work exactly the same as WordPress back

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,230
when ago so you can activate this plugin

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,220
and then you can go and create a new

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:05,010
post create a new page try and add a

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:09,720
testimonial try and do your translations

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:14,120
and see how the hub within the effects I

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,830
would say the ninety was said within the

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,810
without problem okay

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,060
it's a ninety percent good work with our

00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:26,250
problem but they stood at ten percent

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:27,750
right so what do we do okay so first

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,400
thing to do would be to upgrade your

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,170
themes and plugins all right

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,780
so Gutenberg has been in development

00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:38,700
since January 2017 and working 2017 what

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,290
happens in Europe last year we've

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,020
already already talking about with the

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,770
drug so with a look it's like almost two

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:49,710
years old they've been developing it and

00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:53,130
if the regular user doesn't know a good

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,840
the biggest developers and

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,789
like a mother's definitely know I

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,010
remember this so they already have time

00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:01,080
to prepare and if you aggregate keeps up

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:04,230
like yesterday that might fix the issue

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,360
all right so this is the DB team and the

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,150
DP team is a very popular team anybody

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,059
here use giving giving you right okay

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:15,270
now DV has got a spoon page builder

00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:17,940
right so how is it going to complete

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,140
we've good good girl so DV has now

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,090
figured out a solution

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,190
you're not going to compete they allow

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,799
you to choose so you can create a page

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:28,830
create a post and then you can choose to

00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,150
use the default editor and the default

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,360
editor which the mean is the new

00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:36,299
wordpress blog and if there are also

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,760
known as student work okay so step two

00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:42,770
is to update your keep some plugins

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,659
those of you who use our 32 plugins

00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:48,059
maybe consider investing by the origin

00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,120
of life so you get a break okay then

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,100
also you have no viruses that's good and

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:56,340
step 3 now if everything doesn't work

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:59,039
for you okay if if if you install it and

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:03,270
the site is like completely and usable

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:06,840
alright here's an example this is the

00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:10,830
client site and this is using M for

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,350
anybody can use and 14 and 40 nights ok

00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,929
so and you know and for has got this a

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:19,429
be a layout builder right so if you

00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,429
installed within Pericles what happens

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,679
and then you'd be like I wasn't doing

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,470
that

00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:31,039
okay so if this happens to you all right

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:32,990
and then you and then you have you are

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,470
not able to go and change all the pages

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,779
you know so there's solutions but that

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,480
is you can install this thing called the

00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:43,279
classic editor plugin people that

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,640
develop WordPress they know that not

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:49,580
everybody is going to be ready so they

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,610
have to release this classic editor

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:55,519
plugin and this will this will just this

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:58,220
will make the editor go back to the both

00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:01,250
the classic editor all right so this

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,529
means this will continue the work visual

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,730
composer but the you know work anything

00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:07,370
that you use before work when they need

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,580
to work just like it was in the

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:15,679
wordpress 4.9 20 okay they are supposed

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:17,840
to other plugins like disabled whatever

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,639
but I mean I think you should good

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,919
official and this is the official

00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:26,049
classic editor by wordpress complete

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,049
contributors okay

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,980
so this is a final thing every other

00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:35,580
share of you guys that Gutenberg editor

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,429
is the future of WordPress you know in a

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,539
few years time everything that we do is

00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:46,710
going to be your block you know I mean

00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:49,590
we talk a lot about widgets and short

00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:52,530
codes you know but in the future all

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:56,130
that is going to be take the backseat

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:58,320
and we are going to then move on to

00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,130
blocks everything is going to be a block

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,559
all right

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,960
the speaker of any Prasad he's going to

00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,510
talk about how to develop for good at

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,610
work so I'm very excited to learn about

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:13,679
that process is right there in the dory

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,780
okay the good demo Canada is the future

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,230
WordPress so if you're building a site

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:21,330
now if your site now doesn't work with I

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,669
suggest that you know you plan to

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,710
upgrade it sometime in the future

00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:29,490
all right it doesn't have to be today

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:33,030
tomorrow right but I mean if you want to

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:36,150
buy if you want to buy a phone you know

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:39,330
you wouldn't buy a phone with less

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:45,260
features you know like let's say for

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:48,750
example my old phone was iPhone 6s and I

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,330
know upgraded to the - 10s and I mean

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,169
like you know

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:57,789
I am NOT going to go from a six Tests to

00:25:52,169 --> 00:26:01,899
samsung s6 oh I would get a s9 right or

00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:03,639
a 10s so when you are building your site

00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:06,429
right now and you want to output your

00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:09,489
site I also suggest that you look to the

00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:11,649
future and plan to have a good teamwork

00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:13,360
friend inside because like I said the

00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:14,470
book is the future WordPress in the

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,220
future everything is going to be all

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,869
about blocks and if you don't get with

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:27,279
the program then you're gonna be left

00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:32,379
behind now WordPress 1.02 today sort of

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:34,419
feels like a mobile phones off of two

00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:39,460
thousands who had it not yet with you I

00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:43,840
know right lasted forever oh maybe just

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:46,029
like three days right and I mean I I

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,629
don't want you to think the wordpress

00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:51,309
5.0 is going to be the future I mean

00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:53,679
some some recently and asked portable

00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:57,249
screens and stuff like that yes

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,049
what press 500 is it is going to be the

00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:01,269
foundation for the future but I think

00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:03,399
we're astronomers not future it's not

00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:08,889
like this but prescribed by always

00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:11,139
server in between stage before future

00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:13,419
WordPress and and we're gonna have all

00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:15,489
this amazing new features you know that

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:17,590
in-between stage for force like you know

00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:20,080
like the trio I want to be a touchscreen

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:22,509
but I still when I have a p10 right and

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,059
like all of them I like that and I want

00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:27,700
a big screen and I still wanna keep at

00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:29,110
you know so so what press 500 I think

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,950
it's going to be a bit like

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:35,170
in other experience and there will be a

00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,870
bit of rough ninjas there will be a bit

00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:39,370
of frustration but I mean the future

00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:43,450
looks good the future looks bright for

00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,590
WordPress okay and that's it

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,930
that's it for my talk thank you very

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,350
much and any questions are we happy to

00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,350
answer them

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,369
