Title: David Wang: Content Creation and Distribution in WordPress 5.0
Publication date: 2019-05-13
Playlist: WordCamp Kuala Lumpur 2018
Description: 
	A new age of WordPress is upon us, and a better way to create and distribute rich content has (finally) arrived.
For far too long, WordPress content has been encapsulated within a box, having to rely on shortcodes, TinyMCE plugins and other hacks in order to create captivating experiences.
Now, with Gutenberg and WordPress 5.0, all of this changes. No longer are content creators required to conform to the limitations of the box; instead, these writers now have a blank canvas on which to explore their ideas as they create content, much the same way a painter ideates through a masterpiece.
