how do we do it as a condition how to be

00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:40,450
overcome this we have to be mean too

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,450

to the naughty spot

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:50,679
look at my notice I put commencement in

00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:50,679
so that is our NOP to

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:56,400
so so

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,970
[Music]

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,930
[Music]

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:50,090
that communication is although esteem

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,760
soon as messy closet because in

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,310
automatic we have call support or

00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,730
whatever which means we have collision

00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:02,150
from across many many many factors so we

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,580
don't expect that communication to be I

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:08,500
ask you a question you must be ready we

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,500
understand that if an ask a question

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,430
[Music]

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:14,960
any knowledge of any conclusion from

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:21,619
slack conversation discussion all this

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:24,649
is recorded and any time anybody can do

00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:26,269
for this begin so it is useful for

00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:28,549
somebody who works in the conversation

00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:33,860
it is useful for someone who just joined

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:36,619
the company contacted us before so let's

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,019
go and sit and they can find all this

00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:41,090
read along as if you know they must be

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,740
that in the sled what has discussed

00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:49,480
about this issue before so that is the

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,480
amazing thing about text communication

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,020
certain freedom about a litter box

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,380
[Music]

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,309

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,450
[Music]

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,839
[Music]

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,760
so

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:35,270
and remotely working we must regularly

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,270
