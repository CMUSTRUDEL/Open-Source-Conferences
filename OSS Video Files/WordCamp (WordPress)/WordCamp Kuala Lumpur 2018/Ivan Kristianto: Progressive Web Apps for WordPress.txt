Title: Ivan Kristianto: Progressive Web Apps for WordPress
Publication date: 2019-05-13
Playlist: WordCamp Kuala Lumpur 2018
Description: 
	Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a new way to enhance user experience that reach our website. 3 components of PWA:
1. Reliable – Load instantly and even when you are offline.
2. Fast – Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
3. Engaging – Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.
WordPress as default doesn’t support PWA out of the box. By bringing performance first approach and enrich our user with PWA way, could bring better experience for our clients and users.

website another speed and speed so first

00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,489
day we are talking about how to make

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,070
fast websites okay

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:08,829
first website is not just a lot fast in

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:13,000
one gene network we are lucky to live in

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:18,880
Kuala Lumpur enjoy that we are we have

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,430
quality connection in every city but

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,920
some of our friends out there does

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,989
attempted larceny they only have 3G

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,790
connection or even worse

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,569
eg connection but how can we give our

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:37,109
website for hours

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:37,109
how can we service them with our product

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,730
let's come with the PWA

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:49,389
there are so many definition with the PW

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,330
out there but I like this most a new way

00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:54,400
to do

00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:59,720
amazing use of experience on the web

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:04,160
imagine this you have a brick WordPress

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,860
website very informative and ready

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,650
it could benefit in yourself but if the

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:13,490
user cannot use your website the site is

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,920
loading very slow in a 3G network then

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,140
I'm going to never going to use your

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,340
website or your services and it's your

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:25,970
loss because we believe in boomer

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:29,060
statistic in stock and India there are

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,970
more treating users in the network

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,010
rather than 40 because 41 in a big city

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:40,190
but we didn't work in another part of

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:46,190
traffic some sense PWA is file with F is

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:49,340
fast integrated reliable and engaging so

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,010
PW site is to be reliable in the NT

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:56,710
Network Commission then speed are you

00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:59,750
ready okay I would like to do some

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:07,270
exercise here can you open your Google

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:13,640
Chrome please and actually you have an

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:18,800
opening this app squash the app you will

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:23,150
see this kind of okay what is the site

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,390
do this is a sophisticated PWA built by

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:30,800
the Google team this this useful service

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:34,729
worker and worker and asked me to

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,050
promote your images and compress it in

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:39,229
any network condition and in any device

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,410
okay

00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:46,470
you can add it to your normal and

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:50,190
and could be an app a web application

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:55,110
and you can use anywhere even without

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:57,930
network permission so imagine in offline

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,680
mode this one is still working if you

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:04,620
can compress images and it's just work

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:10,440
you can sign later it's it's working in

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:15,960
Linux and Linux and windows and soon to

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:21,740
come to make next year so you got the

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,840
idea of a bit array so where to start

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,980
they went to stop how to make your

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,470
website faster and VIP w8 the

00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:35,490
first this is the this is the new that I

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,260
got from founders of it it's for web doc

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,240
death

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:42,210
this website is allow you to test your

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,190
website with the scoring system and tell

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,740
you what you can improve with your

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:51,120
website for example I create a website

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:54,410
at their website that we see here 2018

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,950
but I focused on to the top and this is

00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:03,390
what I give me erect you to pay

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,030
attention on this part first one that

00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,430
pain first meaningful paint until the

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,230
time to interactive this did not work

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,250
that you need to improve with your

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:17,040
website if you try your website is it

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:23,190
working in please you network is it

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:25,880
working in in slow over phone because

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,800
not everybody has time for my

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:32,180
our use of how does they use a cheap

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,880
model over headphone for smartphone and

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:39,990
inside

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:44,500
oh this looks at this will give you

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:49,630
index on how fast your website is loaded

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,280
and what you can improve I want to talk

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,590
about these three sections which is the

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,030
very important of it every way you need

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,660
to make a fast website

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,900
fast fast fast and super fast your

00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,680
website your user doesn't need to bring

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,070
anything

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,760
so just they don't need to wait too long

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,650
to sell yourself and you can read more

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,830
about how to make the first website and

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:19,570
your website need to be work in any

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:22,030
network condition any condition even in

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:26,650
your in life right okay

00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,420
Wi-Fi that is fine okay what we have

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,040
what my questions but it's like to ask

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,020
questions when we are elderly or the

00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,220
toilet it just doesn't work

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:39,760
okay and this in your product or your

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:43,120
website still works and of course your

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:51,700
site need to be safe and secure HTTPS is

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:55,240
the mass here is some small changes that

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:58,210
you can use as you need to optimize

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,270
images of course because however how

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:04,570
fast your website is if your upload to

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,610
megabyte or four megabyte image it will

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,829
slow

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:15,329
now you can remove unnecessary code for

00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:18,060
example I still remember those time

00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:20,430
people love to use sign in their own

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:24,870
picks and I believe people still do that

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:28,200
this thing that's why the code is only

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:32,970
happening toppings but why'd you lock

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,970
the slide alone in signal post money

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:39,510
right you only need to use slider in

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:42,089
homepage on don't be loaded in see the

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,519
post is accessible we need to remove

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:48,060
unnecessary code you need to leverage

00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:51,420
browser caching and walking home okay I

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,230
want to talk about rocky cove there's a

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,750
tutorial for critical rendering path

00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:01,680
that's tell you how the plaza work in

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:05,130
rendering the website and in fact CSS

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,399
and JavaScript is blocking - what I mean

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:13,410
by blocking call is the process stop

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:16,260
rendering after that CSS and JavaScript

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,350
loop so you need to the movement of info

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:24,360
you need to use a synchronous the first

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:27,120
step and optimize your CSS and cockpit

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,380
you don't need to know everything at

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,380
once and give to the user you just do to

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,810
give the use of what they need

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:42,329
that's another of importance imagine you

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:47,450
come to emptiness time you and you're

00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:51,230
probably your girlfriend or wife comfort

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:54,700
and then you asked for the vineyard for

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:58,280
that from the waiters and you wait and

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,360
when you wait for two minutes three

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,750
minutes five minutes

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,410
the women haven't gone yet and you ask

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,340
the waitress

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,780
where's the menu I like to order and the

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,450
waiter said oh wait

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,620
we have depending on the menu for you so

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:19,130
when the menu can't we just give you

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:23,120
instant that's what happened to our user

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:25,850
with our website so when the use of

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,970
visit our website is just white blank

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:32,030
screen right and the user need to wait

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,160
until it's loaded everything and just

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,830
move which is your website

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,600
this is everything you just scroll and

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:48,200
see the content that's what happened in

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:50,300
Indy for teams of workers will let the

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,440
sketch plug in there are so many workers

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,100
keeps dragging out there this is funny

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,250
some of it

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:03,050
and my point is in this too everything

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:06,140
operates and we're speaking but I'm

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,050
gonna commend anyone to use that but use

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,620
whatever you prefer as long as it makes

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:16,460
your surface our beside pasta in surface

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,070
file for example in my speech case

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,740
forever indicates pockets you can

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,760
compress JavaScript into one file or the

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,660
JavaScript

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,639
and all the CSS into one file mrs.

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:34,550
fennan book and also is doing the big

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:41,380
case to make your website pasta in so

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:46,579
secondly and to make them to make the

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:48,910
WordPress site become a network in

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:53,110
offline mode we need surface water

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:57,980
surface marker is a metaphor see that

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:59,829
live in the middle of your browser this

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,930
is to catch all the requests and

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:06,589
determine you the case instantly for

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,690
example when a user to stop the question

00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:12,079
of website it goes to the surface water

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:15,620
and surface water will check if we have

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,709
the case or if we have the case that it

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:22,250
will instantly this is what the piece of

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:27,170
technology that allow to be able offer

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:29,540
and then the service worker will ask the

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,589
network on your server and it returned

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,620
to sender case

00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:36,829
so during the first page service worker

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:40,100
is not installing okay it happened in

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:44,899
the next visit and this piece of

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:50,110
technology allow us to leverage the case

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:50,110
in the browser and give him instant

00:13:50,680 --> 00:14:01,160
surface mortality support in mantle

00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:04,399
processor but this is the flora website

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,120
in work in many multiple device for

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:17,569
example Linux with Firefox on with

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:20,600
chrome windows with H or Chrome and so

00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:23,079
on but it still not come to the Mac user

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,389
here it will come to the Mac user by

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,149
early next year

00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:30,760
ok

00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:37,839
to make discovers workable it's a little

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:38,320
bit me I can say I skilled in Javas

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,470
people

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,470
this is this tool called what was it

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:49,779
make us easier to install service worker

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:54,490
in our website and the most important

00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:56,019
and the most happy news for me is now it

00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,320
comes free with the feed are very

00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:00,630
practical so what first have now feed on

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:07,420
your pocket

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:10,000
support by xwp and this use this use the

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,420
box to detect remover and it's very easy

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,779
to do let's have an exercise together

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:24,250
now go to this video ly that we see here

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:29,769
because I think it demo and you will see

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:32,050
this website I click its website in less

00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:35,529
than one hour okay

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:39,010
this website is not a replacement for

00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:42,010
the Android app they stand for the

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,560
double she were capable but this will be

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:48,850
to see the speakers schedule and

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:53,110
organizes information and it is also

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,200
allowing to add to homescreen is it just

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,580
was like

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,430
please forgive me about the front-end

00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,550
stuff because I'm gonna for any

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,030
development

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:11,820
I just come as fast as possible to make

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:13,680
this website as a VW sorry yeah I I

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,220
could s why are you playing with a

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:22,560
minimum internet connection

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:25,110
[Applause]

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,720
the combination with the Android app and

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,920
don't you need to download it megabyte

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:35,970
if I'm not mistaken boosting and this

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:38,400
only 150 kilowatt you can see the

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,130
information but not as sophisticated as

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:46,380
the number one but you can still see the

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,950
information with just 150 kilowatt isn't

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,620
that bad

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:55,010
so then exciting like you make the web

00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:59,160
just like an app that's a PW me okay

00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:01,050
since I know what the problem is it's

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:08,130
good to give a presentation with a code

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:11,100
right just earlier using this plug-in I

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:14,880
have only needed to be find what I need

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:19,040
to page to define the work what I did to

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:24,770
store in local storage in this example i

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:27,570
catched all the image and save it

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:31,680
integrates with the strategy of case for

00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:33,630
us what it means like it's possible when

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,840
the request came to the surface water

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,820
so then equipment to the Sun well it

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,440
gets by the service worker if we have

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:45,930
not games then serveth Kate's first

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,170
that's it it's just kids if we don't

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:53,970
have a case as a server and storing the

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:56,190
case and we can allow to set expiration

00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:00,870
or he makes for this example

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:04,860
said it into one day and another part is

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:07,379
the force I'm sure that you all have to

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,970
perform yourself every SEC now have a

00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:15,600
little force but it's slow who agree

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,629
with what is slow right I see very

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,419
handsome with this you can catch Google

00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:25,559
Fonts in your local so and so when your

00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:27,960
user visit your site the second time it

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,940
doesn't need to reload a Google form for

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:36,299
yourself or anyone it's just stuff

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:41,700
google forms this is definitely make

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:42,149
your website faster you could think

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,419
about

00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:49,110
pwe it comes it will make a lot of

00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:52,200
functions to make the website more looks

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:56,759
like an app but you don't have to apply

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,830
everything for your use of that just

00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,929
come to yourself we call it a little

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:07,230
user you just to make your website very

00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:11,279
fast secure it works offline but work to

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:14,639
them in you have like a service that you

00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,919
do something use every day you can add

00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:21,330
another app features for example push

00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:23,370
notifications like under that when the

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,639
organizer use the notifications you see

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,740
in the in mobile this must all work with

00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:31,710
web PWA

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,620
it will be post notification involving

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,040
the Apple house

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,270
so it looks like an app it has a

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,180
clearance yeah

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:42,430
what is clean is an API for your user to

00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,350
log in to your website

00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,510
it's just need to take use the

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,230
fingerprint sensor for example it just

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:53,020
use the credential yeah your user can

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:57,780
log in easily because the credentials

00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:00,460
are in the mobile device security and

00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,610
e-commerce site you can use store

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:08,740
manager so they can connect to the

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:14,200
grouping or another versatile it has the

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:17,500
payment API then with all this credit

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,870
card information is stored locally safe

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,020
and secure when it comes to use the

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:30,850
feminine guy here so just one click buy

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:33,880
or one is finish your payment by using

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:40,120
another surface but in your mobile is

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:44,530
just like wow that's really good so if

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,890
you are a developer or a business when

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:53,320
you need to invest into PWA

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:59,350
in some study case who oversee it works

00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:01,750
in 2g network with just a second and 50

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,179
kilo byte only for the perhaps for the

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,790
first mode and then it blow everything

00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:13,510
in let's move so it's when you open up

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:17,500
an account is just fast instead now it

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:20,920
has a camera access when it has offline

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,930
upload so when another Instagram offline

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,360
is stored into the

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,470
poets and wait for the network to be

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,780
online and in our local innings it has a

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:38,790
notification and had a person living as

00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:42,220
well Twitter after tweet after freedom

00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:48,040
changed the motorcycle into PWA they see

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:51,670
a lot of - it's 75% increase complaints

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,380
and also 20% decrease in last day

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:59,680
that's a good thing for business life

00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:02,470
and more if you like to see what you see

00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,480
how many's website and business of the

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:11,170
implement video a way for the website

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:13,990
and improve okay here's the here's the

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:18,640
catch some say speed every wave will

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:22,390
replace Android app but for my opinion

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:27,520
it doesn't have to do to replace in some

00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:30,880
case and some study guest says them PWA

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:35,590
strikes could work with I'm going as

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:40,000
well like Pavarotti when your user

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:42,690
doesn't need to install your surface is

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,790
under they can use the for websites but

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,430
some some users after they proven yet

00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,890
with your mobile sites they installed

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:53,320
Android app rather than just go to your

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,690
website to use our service please

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,230
download our app and your app is 100

00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:02,640
megabyte away right why don't just they

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:06,400
use the website spike away from your

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:11,650
websites it's just like 150 kilo white

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,600
and they can use your service ok so if

00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:18,660
you have any problem we need to convince

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,660
your boss just go to PW starts and

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:27,169
and if you are endo product I would say

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:30,440
recommend you to look and invest in PWA

00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:32,929
sites so you can have more use of two

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,549
counting to enter with your business and

00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:41,030
services this is the like a vision of

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:42,890
Google they call next billion users so

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:47,090
who directly support us in Southeast

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:49,309
Asia and India and Brazil that has very

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:53,570
slow internet connection compared to

00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:55,909
another country PWS try to select your

00:23:53,570 --> 00:24:02,390
user can still use your websites even

00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:06,309
though very unreliable to make a reader

00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:09,679
website is not an easy job I can tell me

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:13,010
it's not a private and inflating process

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,429
we keep informed when your site analyze

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:18,710
it remove unnecessary or remove and

00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,659
optimize images they move Manassas and

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,909
intervention actually they know

00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,809
everything that has slowed us so

00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,809
indulging ourselves

00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:29,419
it's the styling process especially for
