Description: 
	Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a new way to enhance user experience that reach our website. 3 components of PWA:
1. Reliable – Load instantly and even when you are offline.
2. Fast – Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
3. Engaging – Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.
WordPress as default doesn’t support PWA out of the box. By bringing performance first approach and enrich our user with PWA way, could bring better experience for our clients and users.
