	00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,090
so

00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:29,230
Tony's book on how to be

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,199
[Music]

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,199
yeah

00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,490
Oh

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:29,630
so okay so I like that yeah

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,969
[Music]

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,279
[Music]

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:33,290
so if you see they say block navigation

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,870
spa you can see the new connector that

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,090
will show you the list of blocks that

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,489
has been used in the page unison in a

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,760
sequence of manner so that way we show

00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:50,329
shoe that rocks are are the basic

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:58,910
building blocks for any post or page so

00:02:50,329 --> 00:03:02,600
I so the first thing is there are assets

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:06,890
first you need to create to develop a

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:10,820
new block the first one is a PHP file

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:14,900
and JavaScript file and a spicy so the

00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,709
PHP file will basically into your

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:22,070
scripts and style to the content editor

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:25,510
so the new already ready is completely

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:29,680
on JavaScript so what it does

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:32,830
is it will give you a misrepresentation

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,739
and it has a quote representation as

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,140
well and meaning to save your culture it

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,049
will send the necessary markup to the

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:44,670
back end to save it so you need a PHP

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:47,799
file to include your space and start and

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:51,720
if you speak you have to register your

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:55,120
blog and in your sights you have to

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,890
define your style or content and that

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:04,750
invested its it might it's easier to

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:07,209
have them separate for example you can

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,829
have two separate extensions first one

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:14,379
will be for both content and Becca and

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:28,419
the second one is the specific already

00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:32,680
for anything so this is how so again

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:34,840
it's developer centric sorry Tom I am

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,190
sure most of you understand this course

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:43,500
later so what we are doing is basically

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:46,240
you are entering your size and speed so

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,630
normally what you do in word processors

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,320
lose their jobs as we need new skills

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,430
and then content actions but does

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,090
provide

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,669
as a Chancellor so you can use the

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,919
impure dog asepsis

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:07,190
to make you any assets in the fountain

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,630
and if you block any efforts to impunity

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,300
in the backend editor'

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:15,380
so that's your ph to find what it

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:19,190
basically what it does is it loads all

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,770
the units to the front end okay and this

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,240
is how your first block is going to look

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,060
like

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:32,630
so every see everything is in javascript

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:36,919
is an object to every editor so at every

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,990
block can be represented in a bra so

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,050
what you do is you import the edges

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,270
couple of type function and you register

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,150
your block there are two parameters to

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:51,610
give to this function the first one is

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:54,730
the name and in a namespace name

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,010
so I've got to run through a basic

00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,850
example that we speak the welcome

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:05,350
message in our work with them here

00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:09,690
itself and how I can extend that to

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:13,960
incorporate more and more features so

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:17,110
the options we need to yes

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,169
mandatory and public demands optional

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:23,500
example but description for the applause

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:27,820
is optional and I can it's optional

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,449
achieve keywords so that means when they

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:34,539
when someone's first and goal

00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:37,840
that's optional so you have to define a

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:40,000
title category and there are two

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,090
functions you have to define one is the

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,930
any functional and the scale function so

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:51,160
what the Edit function does is whatever

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:54,479
you defy the inside it will display in

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,830
the editor and they say a function

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,410
whatever you define this day of Fortune

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,570
we mean is bending content so I have

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,870
that right here

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,150
you can see I've explained what this

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:10,270
place is a return but this place in the

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:13,810
contents two messages so if you insert

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,450
that block in editor you can see how how

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,300
the displacement when it

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:21,720
not from the back end and the front end

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,140
so what this place in there it is being

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,140
displayed

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:30,550
is different so that's maybe hello

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,170
so I'm going to extend these so these

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:47,710
are two attic this is a static draw in

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,710
this place message I want to modify this

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,680
so this is a block trillion inversion

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,550
but when you go to this ampere is

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,710
selected when you see the already

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,020
displaced what is going to be his bed in

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,210
the fountain so internally what future

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,610
work does is when you type

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,850
in ten words what is going to be

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,350
displayed in your front end and it's it

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,120
falls in an object

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,120
the time constants

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,699
so you can see the differences here in

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,680
the front end and back end so

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,110
I mentioned earlier I want to introduce

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,409
any so I can type in a welcome message

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:37,320
and displayed to the user so that's we

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:41,070
are the block attributes comes into play

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,610
it's basically if I can be defined as a

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,610
state of

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,110
with properties of the phone but let's

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,470
make the texting each other by well

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:58,040
rather is being a static message I want

00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:01,370
to give you an input so you can type in

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,760
whatever you want to display so this is

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:07,340
how it's going to look in the editor the

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,640
Texas now monitor and this is the

00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,640
powerful

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,759
or what

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:22,769
what you have to do is you have to

00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:25,519
introduce and so you can see the title

00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:25,519
and really

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,560
yeah we have quickly slides I don't know

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,240
what can can upset so if you want to

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,600
fight but that's light so that you can

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,600
see it

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,860
so the title in the category was from

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,340
the basic I am introducing an attribute

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,680
here

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,200
so according it as a Content here I'm

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,140
finding a couple of properties that is

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,320
where the attribute for example it's of

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:04,150
type string and the source of the

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:07,150
attribute which data selector so I'm I'm

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,940
passing custom class as a selector and

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,190
the source of the

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,820
what's inside that selector so that's

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:17,520
welcome entities attributes property and

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,670
here and what if I delete and as a

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,160
function to accommodate that use include

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,970
tricks for example and in any function

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:30,030
of introducing an input P and in the

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:34,530
save function I am displaying what is

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:36,720
being included in the and when you when

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,480
you types and something I have defined

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,190
an on change event that will set their

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:47,370
attribute the new attribute for this

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,990
block and it displays it in the same

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,420
function

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:55,440
so whenever you type in hello

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,740
it's been converted in the same

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,839
it's explained in the backend market so

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,790
that's the right side you see the basic

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,490
block we have created penny and the

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,209
other side then you go and introduce an

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,209
input feed

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:15,670
so next I'm going to talk about block

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:20,260
controls and inspector control that's

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:29,200
the next step so when you define a block

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:36,480
or you want to feature that you can use

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:39,160
for example when you select your block

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,480
inspector controls will be displayed in

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:46,990
the right side and will be displayed in

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,260
and so for example this is a heading

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,510
flow and if I select a heading there are

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,700
a couple of options from the reading for

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:58,200
example

00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:00,520
which extract I want to use and I can

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,410
define the text that I meant for the

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,250
hitting and there are a couple of

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:09,340
options in the top menu so these are two

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,620
controls so I'll show you an example now

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:16,540
let's add a color picker for the other

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:22,720
context so I have added so this is how

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:28,600
it's going to be disabled so if for our

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:31,450
basic example color picker so that I can

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,400
change the color of protect so this is

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:38,260
that for to how to do them so the

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,220
difference here from the previous photo

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,260
hey Sam

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,230
I mean I'm introducing a huge spectacle

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:48,550
to all-tournament and putting whatever I

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,900
want inside there so I get displayed in

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:56,540
the block

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:58,640
so I am introducing our ally and I'm

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:04,070
defining man another attribute for this

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:06,800
law called color and as saving the

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,800
attribute we have exchanged from the

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,470
inspector control so let's look at

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:16,610
behind the scenes what's happening

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:19,370
so when you go to your 4th editor and

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,920
when you see what's being saved in the

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:26,330
back you notice something different from

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:31,670
the previous like the colleagues being

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:36,380
saved as an element inside the comment

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:39,410
so the difference by exact in years

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,500
here you have setup defined a selector

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,170
for the collateral but for the contact

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:51,020
will happen to define a selector so what

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:55,550
good does is saves the message inside a

00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:59,840
comment delimiter so everything in the

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:01,340
butrint work editor epic of babies safe

00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,870
when he's wrapping

00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:09,180
and that is the Gutenberg that this is

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,790
the separate row so that every time the

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:15,780
page is presented processing and these

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:19,370
pages in the any technology so next I am

00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,370
going to run through the top

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,350
so as I mentioned before where the work

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,540
is completely JavaScript but there are

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:34,020
options in the PHP saying you can talk

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:37,240
to a block for example block templates

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,720
so if you define a custom post type it's

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,720
a speaker

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,290
you'll find a couple of elements that's

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,360
needed for the speaker for example I

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,370
need a profile picture I need their

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,149
tents and I need a description for the

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:56,339
speaker I can't define it as a broad

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:58,890
so this is the portable data say

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,290
terrible first everybody must be

00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:05,810
familiar with this portable speaker you

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:10,470
register poster inside any action and

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:13,470
data so the new parameter here is the

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:17,670
template and you define three blocks

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:19,950
that it's a muscle that all the speakers

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,260
must have and there's a new parameters

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,440
when it's for template long so when you

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,540
define this guy's no no other dogs can

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,079
be added to that poster so this is how

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,079
it's going to

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,829
you need tighten and

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:38,769
[Music]

00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:40,770
next thing we are going to look at the

00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:44,010
register block type function as

00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:46,339
eh-eh we want to define a couple of

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,339
properties

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:56,210
first you have been there for that

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:56,210
argument so in our previous slide

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,459
in our previous life a venue when you

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,660
register a new table here there are two

00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:09,100
function suppose one is daily function

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,750
which describes what's going to be

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,529
displayed in the hitter and the same

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:17,540
function which displays what's going

00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:20,319
so let's say these aesthetics program

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,589
they say you have a neatest post type

00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:26,449
custom blog and you're not sure what to

00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:30,709
be paying the front end is going to be

00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:33,040
defined when the page doors you can use

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,040
this

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,800
rent a callback function so for what it

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:44,690
does is if you have defined a renter for

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:46,550
that function for a custom block like it

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,980
overrides the JavaScript to save

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:52,399
function and use this to display

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,130
worsening of what's going to be in the

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,580
front

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,580
I'm returning

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:06,209
and it's generated from CHP the next set

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,780
of parameters dependence blah blah is

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:13,620
the editor spectrum editor spent so

00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:17,130
rather in queen your assets from ten and

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:21,120
nineteen you can define the custom

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:24,350
handle for your JavaScript file and the

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:29,300
style sheet and this functionality of

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,300
loading needs in the necessary

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:40,380
the next thing I am going to quickly run

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:43,410
through with plugins so we have a custom

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,970
clock then displays a customer ship and

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,529
the

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:52,429
and we have an option to add to set the

00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:54,510
color of the Texas then I want to add as

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,780
I quite the beautiful

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,780
information among

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:06,929
so this is how you do that this is the

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:10,650
function provided by the Explorer

00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:12,720
register blocking its simplest register

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,570
block type you have to pass a meal and

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,429
object that as an icon property and a

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:25,190
rental property so what is rendered but

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:29,490
it vendors is the date of birth empty

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:36,290
and you can see so for an actor acting

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:39,240
as my D and you can see how it's and

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,640
what you pass inside the plug-in side

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:46,290
bar will be displayed in the parking and

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,900
what will pass inside there many right

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,710
so you can select and deselect the

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:55,470
display of the panty the next thing I am

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:58,570
going to run through is boots

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:03,310
I'm sure most of you

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:06,430
most abilities and the evidence tell me

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,440
the basis for extending reference and

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:11,140
they have introduced the same concept

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,470
from Wittenberg instead so this is the

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:18,880
books API for Goodrem book so looking at

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:23,650
these you can identify a family a

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:26,909
function and a filter and actions

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,450
excellent and these are available

00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:29,450
and behave

00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:39,509
so so let's say I have a cock-block the

00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,489
displacer well covers it

00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:46,169
that's been written by some other

00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:48,539
developer but I want to control some of

00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:51,360
the attributes of it for example if

00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:53,610
someone writes a better message Bible to

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,450
reading the spaces in the front and the

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,730
back as well

00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,389
I want to train them so that's we are

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:03,470
that comes into play so this is a

00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:07,830
registered filter

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:11,009
what it does is when you hit when you

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:14,159
edit a block and before it's going to

00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:18,330
save in the backend in the same object

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,070
you run it is Peter so you have the

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,129
option to modify the property for

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:26,999
example I am using this filter to pass

00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:30,869
it to a function called rip trim content

00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:33,299
and what I did I get the content

00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:36,859
attribute and I treat me and I return

00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,859
back the element

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:47,140
student comes with a lot of components

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:49,540
for example I might make the blocker

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,520
help walk through then displays a

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,340
welcome message use a simple HTML

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,200
element but wouldn't work comes with a

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,110
lot of favorite element as well for

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,179
example

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:04,080
for the color picker you can use the

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:07,260
palette reform and yes much more you can

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,240
if you go to the a github page and CBS

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:15,870
law school you can see on the

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:20,039
and cages component this this is the

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:22,820
last thing I want to talk about so

00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:25,590
setting up your development environment

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,940
so I would highly recommend the

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,940
the project

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:40,510
it works similarly for create react

00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:42,790
similar to create reactivity

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:47,320
so what it does is you have to install

00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:48,550
that and if you give a name for your got

00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,850
it will generate all the necessary

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:54,340
assets and the base bits and the

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:57,460
configuration for that so you can

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:00,700
straight away in time into the otherwise

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:03,910
you have to in queue your assets and we

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:08,590
are configure your web pack files and

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:10,630
maybe configure the es6 transpilers

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,520
before you can actually start your

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,360
development so if you are not familiar

00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:20,620
with all those things you can use

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:23,919
in general to create broken dive into

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:31,419
them and went away the second hybrid

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:35,140
varieties setup the girl from the

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:37,600
working copy from github not to Dhoni

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,280
stole the money from the planet rapport

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,340
because it comes

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,960
I say if you if you are writing a blog

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,030
and you want to figure out what's going

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,570
[Music]

00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,370
doesn't provide the source for the third

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,690
thing is always trying to use the modern

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,690
Java speed

00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:02,200
it's better always output coordinates

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:06,930
source to the content for example if you

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,930
are using webpack maybe you can use

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,990
that we all put in from technical

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:19,910
and user breakpoints to debug and

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:24,620
consult of using control of edge

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:27,810
minister so we will use controller

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,940
it's very strong so if you move

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,280
especially if you want to get used to

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,800
the internals and the last thing is

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,210
spelling you to be like after I finish

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,289
the presentation one of my

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,289
[Music]

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,980
so in the co-operative they still don't

00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:51,269
have a Chema but if you can create a

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:54,009
configure that that will enable you to

00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:57,100
Gemma actually appear from a react

00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:59,530
background this a medium in which

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:03,080
American Sarah

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:05,570
automatically company it's a matter what

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,690
if you are familiar with it you manage

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:11,090
that when you edit a file and save it it

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,280
quickly loads the module in the

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:17,120
front-end and display voltage changes so

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,430
it's better to be though the page so I

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:24,460
have a screenshot of my development

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:30,679
environment which I use to develop

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:33,200
Gutenberg so here you can see so in

00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,450
chrome if you go to the page down in

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,770
this place it will display all your

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:45,530
files in source mode if you use if you

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:49,520
are without a response and you can say

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:54,620
deeper points as there and when you when

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:57,660
you start so I'm using JetBrains TF is

00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,430
most of the modern IDM

00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:03,090
but I've installed the Chrome extension

00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:07,020
for tidbits and started listening here

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:11,330
face it a breakpoint that said the trim

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,330
content and I want to say

00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:18,250
and I can see these in the inspector and

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,550
I can also see you

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,280
[Music]

00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:26,360
and here you can see the poster so

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:28,460
remember already I mentioned from

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,970
picture and you stopped liking because

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:35,270
it will enable you to see the source of

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,460
beautiful gastrin and you can let's say

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,590
it's going to income trap and you can

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,220
see the create function and the previous

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:46,280
function and see how actually positive

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:50,390
content before passing into boots so if

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:53,750
you if you have developed with PHP to

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:56,380
your family with a fever and how helps

00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,380
you to leave

00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:02,470
you can do this too
