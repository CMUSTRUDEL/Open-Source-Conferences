[Music]

00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:05,670
so there's no waste I'm les almost of

00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,860
the one right that already have promise

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,799
right oh I believe you already have

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,049
people give me back Danny

00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:19,640
so you just wonder those who have any I

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,380
will show you right it's me how are you

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,869
I think first question you have but

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:30,090
instead by why is having to explanation

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,240
then obviously you have a piece some

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,490
people get me right yes L know

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,070
Oh if you ever believe you I don't

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,030
matter to beat us and you try to set up

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,670
a forgive me

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,950
ba-bang and us people do know anything

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,780
my be there and she will cost and

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,600
talking to publish and read okay because

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:54,659
people are still trust giving other copy

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:57,690
feels right okay baby so tenderly of

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,540
currency do a commentary use so you want

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:03,000
to support a currency right that you can

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,299
transcend and courtesy without any

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,160
currency exchange everyone so let's say

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,039
from the Muslim religion even give a

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,039
right by default is bring it

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,269
and if you want something more a number

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,250
of them no support multi currency okay

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:29,670
but you actually went to repay a lot

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:31,739
more and probably do multi-currency

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,080
given it would make sense for you if you

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,620
want to wear distillation and of

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,540
yourself OCA of a single sign and I

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,730
think the easiest make where we go for

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,420
it is one city publishing available for

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,090
multi currency

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,769
you only stop USD we never as we make

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,410
much easier unless we have a very

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,840
specific method minded

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:57,350
celebration service really helped me and

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,350
my heart

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:14,719
the people giving it today you are

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:29,120
serving overseas I think the easiest

00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:30,040
option for you housing that you get the

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:38,510
money

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:41,780
so this edge we met was more my cash

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,629
flow is you need my team have been

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,689
passed by Bob woods and you know the

00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:57,769
more you do the more critical cash book

00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:59,150
is the limitation plug have ticked off

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,760
these are solvent you know pry the Box

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:20,409
didn't give a because Allah you gave it

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:22,849
has no escape

00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:25,909
so you sell about before you need right

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:33,500
then you can carry it so there's a

00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:36,530
limitation for those right and then the

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,030
second currency social democracy or will

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:54,780
be critical for both of you because

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:54,780
you take with Ganesha most of the time

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:48,190
yes okay you sell something

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,490
then the customer is right you know I

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:54,610
buy actually of red color than the where

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:59,289
you send everyone and then you probably

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:02,590
still be the back say you know and then

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:04,960
pay the full respect and disrespect me

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,470
right can be very costly one

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,440
so what is this way just make sure you

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:17,800
live in style

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:20,030
and the problem all the people he will

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,480
talk as high as a team

00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,910
oh so there's something no joparky might

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,090
happen to you tricking has possibly we

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,130
saw a changing room industry is

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:35,030
sometimes a fireman into account

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:40,610
they were just an extra fiestas from SOS

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:42,320
feeling guilty so they can really

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,890
calculate right what you're getting

00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,290
copied top of the PCB GOP will give us

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,720
now proceed past as I mentioned if you

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:55,930
have reached a platform a ship give me

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,930
the v4 is always reaching for me okay

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,360
[Music]

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:24,830
so people do business a lot and when you

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,500
want to be alone - how we move commerce

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,640
and you wonder why people give me the

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,830
don't individual so the minimum thing

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,500
you should have is a company registered

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:40,040
with policy so I'll see you at a muscle

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:43,040
problem Hannah she said Yamaha right and

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,520
now see so you should have at least

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,590
rival ours investor equity I encourage

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,300

submit occupation as required as well as

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,900
when you go to another place and start

00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,760
opening up the car as well even though

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,820

even online a transfer is the critical

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,300
component right for most of the region

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,760
will be giving today even a cell

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,210

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,370
aggressive in terms of if you if you use

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,470
most of all right

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,930
also they start supporting Ebola is a

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,300
same option means to look at I think

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,880

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:45,000
they are people gives us a wire I trust

people

00:11:48,760 --> 00:12:02,959
so happy and let me write the W level

00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:05,240
any of you like you know alright so a

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:10,790
lot of people problem right because I

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:13,600
did and nothing about all had ideas

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:19,040
right because the volume networking

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,779
event to rewrite disaster so it will

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:28,279
give it a look at people on I think a

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:30,560
party is in the process but you have

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,470
volume notepad right hopefully the next

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,760
round will be able to help

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,920
so that's quietly well and every people

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,600
give a talk about here you cannot assume

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,959
I did or I did have extension will be

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,490
money and most of them they have

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,690
efficient one okay doesn't need to be

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,970
impressive that you know people

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:58,390
partnership on some okay using cocaine

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,390
use nowhere

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:45,160
the interface right yes I am I you know

00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,830
I don't have credit card debit card I

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,890
don't trust it and I go to survey level

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:57,400
or an agnostic man right I pay cash any

00:13:50,890 --> 00:14:00,730
will try using these No so according to

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,700
the statistic right and well cash is the

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:09,640
third largest Hmong car payment option

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:12,550
after Mei Mei who you associate be okay

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:16,390
and I believe this statistic is publish

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,130
and share our okay

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,470
so this interesting thing if you do

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:24,280
something right if you sell to a matter

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:26,830
that is some cat use again or they don't

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,470

right actually help you increase your

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:36,940
soup okay right a very interesting

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:42,160
scenario using payment there are some

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:46,660
large travel site support cash YJ happen

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:50,350
is right those people may use a total of

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:53,500
eleven there is a support for those

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,140
traveling package okay and then you

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,850
probably counter there after that we

00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,850
generate this code right

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,910
and they pay cash for the coupler and

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,560
once you pick it you will encounter the

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:14,840
update right is almost in your hand

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:18,530

a way that probably the only one that do

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:07,030
okay like if you have to stop put money

00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,799
into the countless and every transaction

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,830
building that the chickens be one is

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,960
wondering if he said okay and the other

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,520
thing about this is before I share with

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,630
you about the importance of getting the

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:23,530
money back past

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,530
so how was between visitor

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:33,150
you don't know these guys don't have a

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:37,060
cash flow region so if not ever giving

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:41,170
one-time transaction - IDs Monday to

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:45,670
Sunday okay so you will meet the people

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:50,920
to you on those be on Friday okay this

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,400
one P plus 1 it was mommy's what level

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:58,480
today

00:18:51,400 --> 00:19:01,510
some or all the body okay so there's a

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:05,440
meeting and if you sell high value

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,910
Hector you come unless they right if the

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,560
people give instruction to per second

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:15,850
you say 1000 make it 100 how many causes

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:19,230
hey this one one you get the design yes

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:22,780
so you can we get 50 cent

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:25,750
okay so you really need to know the

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:32,770
mechanism and actually how the between

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:36,340
is quickly and has room to develop

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:40,360
similar property then let you switch the

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:44,110
treatment is almost all if you next does

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:54,520
another power this switch to building -

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:56,740
okay Bob the is something you can I

00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,450
think most of you give you actually sell

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:03,040
night you should have at least comedy

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,409
the reason is if what then was the

00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,840
problem you can switch on another one

00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:14,460
it always had more than one never give

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:18,779
it now I'll give it to you pay anyone

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:24,570
using it know what is nobody using it to

00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:29,070
even know that it's pornography okay

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:32,009
do you actually buy the wrong speech yes

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,869
bacteria stem initiative is of

00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:35,609
robbers you know my block was very

00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:39,059
popular that time there was this the

00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:41,489
clock shop okay and the probably problem

00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:43,279
is by a lot of diplomatic transfer and

00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:45,690
you look at all the transaction right

00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,679
movement which papers people smaller

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:50,159
policy money

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,950
okay so the people of English for that

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,059
they allow addition of field we capture

00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:07,080
you know right so they from there you

00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:10,470
can actually freshman last year they

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,159
actually we develop you know this pivot

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:17,279
to you right so any activity the

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:21,210
communities for you they do support you

00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:43,200
commerce is not that the zoo application

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:46,139
fee and guess how much so the only

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,629
downside of these is let me show you a

00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:55,649
picture ship process might be okay

00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:56,039
secondly they only accept me for your

00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,849
user

00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:04,529
okay so it's not FB f of X plus norm or

00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:06,610
even a to you user network $0.50

00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:57,889
only

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:59,720
in this very local therapy I think so is

00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:04,309
she and I think by the apothem

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:07,250
conception rate is super hyper cell for

00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:08,720
FPS which is also very very deep

00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,639
compared to others

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,820
but I think the cool thing about son of

00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:17,480
a Israel is this the remittance even for

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,009
credit card is very fast so a one of my

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,039
friends that actually you guys in for

00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:24,919
you for a stock of the cable they pay

00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,529
you back twice a week okay the process

00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,850
for you okay

00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:31,159
of course most of them they have a

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:34,429
minimum now whatever you have in the

00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:36,669
back and secondly writes an update if

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:38,899
you are standing on social only today

00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:41,299

00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:43,940
product page feature they are the only

00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:46,610
one they're asking okay so you can

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,220
upload individual for app you know say

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,950
where you put a link then you use a PB

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,570
right or maybe of Briony people go to

00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:58,160

commerce for running operation so there

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:35,180
are new couple of buildings they try to

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:37,610

how much the as we can

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,850
my experience right if the user tries to

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,830
buy something from you it's more than

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:44,420
USD one hell will prompt them to

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:48,110
register for okay that's more my speed

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:50,930
but the real criteria the thing they

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,910
collect in order to trigger these paws

00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,050

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,510
people so quick things right if the

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:09,140

00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:48,550
reason I is there okay then you have

thought you optimal yes it's a link to

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,560
any car skip yet no but most they are

00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,540
going to stop for anything

00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:10,600
oh so imagine if the link of each

00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:12,940
channel you have a big table so both are

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:17,770
popping up because strategy number and

00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:20,080

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:25,540
your trip money so these are what we

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,370
call and what makes them different is

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,720
right why will they are doing they're

00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:36,040
currently linked to visa we take that

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,560
master Viveca NEPA usually all right so

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,050
clearly you get this fabulous car so

00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,630
they are riding on the MasterCard

00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:47,000
network the good thing about these

00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:50,000
commodities they look at

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,080
Yujin and people just they already have

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,990
set credit card

Danika you can't utilize your email

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:59,150
campaign point okay top of the I think

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,710
the downside is right you still be the

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:07,100
country if not the loop Weight Watchers

00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:10,550
you don't have QR code right for you to

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,490
make people then you can't just carry a

00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:20,500
foot around without your car you still

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:20,500
need Cutler when she pick me oh so I

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:38,900

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:46,850
the operating crappy effects of liquid

00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:51,170

book platform ever can access to be

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:59,840
right then without prejudice you know so

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,840
they're not bank and non-bank we can

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,140
transfer money to each other's right

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,600
easily okay that's the why did I have to

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,450
