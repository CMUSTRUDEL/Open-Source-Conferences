Title: Lee Wai Hong: WordPress on Google Cloud Platform
Publication date: 2019-05-13
Playlist: WordCamp Kuala Lumpur 2018
Description: 
	I will share my experience on how I scale the machine to handle large amount of user during the peak season. I have a “pain” experience on how we solve the sudden high traffic while we launch our GE14 campaign (unidrabu.com) to do the cloud funding for free buses service to the voter.

people who are going to develop the

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:50,570

00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:54,560
half website in Internet is actually

00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:59,369

travel how the carriage can SDSU is

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:03,359
actually the NGO which is our we define

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,989
ourselves as a catalyst of the social

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:10,609
change since 1985 we are actually calm

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,989
down Serena regarding human rights and

00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:16,470
they were Democratics

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:21,739
and how the people if you've no place to

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:26,180
write and how we can make and

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:29,239
fortunately on the last g14 we have

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:33,299
opportunity to continue our selves and

00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:47,400
as well as the process we have cantata

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:48,030
project Kaku is actually yeah yeah thank

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,769

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:58,319
we'll be providing free bus to those who

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,690
the water what are people to to get a

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,230
pass again to come back to cast a vote

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,700

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,700
normal say that okay

yeah it's like that the day is like this

00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,970
on the Ramu so I think many people will

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,489
be disappointed because they are not

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,770
ready to go back and cast a vote so at

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,650
the time we say that why not

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,750
we do a crowdfunding project we ask

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,890
people to raise and give us money and we

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:35,730
actually to rent us a very the water go

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:41,820

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:44,850
idea TSST visa so once we have certain

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:49,650
at the time we do have a crowdfunding to

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:51,330

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,370
off what am i what clock in there we're

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,449
going to use for for for there any other

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,029
yes

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:20,709
thanks for the look of us I mean covers

00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:22,959
for the project alright so the people

00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:25,149
once they log into our website

00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,759
they're able to choose their now it's

00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:31,839
just like this is around I just product

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:36,399
so this is a product that show you how

00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:38,829
many I can't really compare to be that

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,490
we still have how many can be left for

00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:46,209
that route so thanks for who covers be

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:49,630
able to actually to give this platform

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:52,029
to work within three days within three

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:57,160
days from from very beginning that we

00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:59,079
decide ship from the to the oppressed

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,439
essentially takes a three days to finish

00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:05,139
the project so this is the ticket that

00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:07,959
they have after the exile and use of

00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:14,800
clock we use a call food event

00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:18,880
and they were able to get like this and

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:26,829
all that we can email and they're able

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:29,139
to stand right so this is the plugin and

00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:31,779
the solution are used for it so maybe

00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:35,050
you can have a long universe and this is

00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:39,009
our perfect all endure abuse thickness

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:41,680
half clear after every messenger this is

00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:44,170
very important you know just now I think

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,040
one of my frequency and support is very

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:51,310
important especially have a such a big

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:56,139
project you want to be a home anymore

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,450
come on go and ask you a lot of

00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,630
questions

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,180
but we see that really Emilia or whether

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,490
it's still my relaxing you can check on

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,010
but I wanna do the like I don't know go

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,360
to the website

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:14,490
okay you can you can reach there so we

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,720
decide that we use the FB messenger

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:22,800
because as a messenger is very I think

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,170
most of the Malaysian have basic how so

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,880
this is one of the support system that

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,550
we use at a time the full event which is

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:40,170
we used generate the key K that I showed

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:45,540
you just now and very strong and steady

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:48,720
state change track for us we also use

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,470
the GA the public a mistake but we

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,380
decided to somehow I found some of a

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,580
browser abroad each year because of it I

00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,540
was provided what

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:07,920
so maybe the camp provides the most

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:10,890
reliable source and tracking system this

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:17,250
is reusing for our daily Bangkok so we

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:19,440
subscribe or these daily backup as well

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,350
as yes sir technician is a real-time

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,660
tactics well so if you guy running a bit

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,120
from make up agenda action you can

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,020
consider this one so this is all this

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,210
other happy

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:34,650
I have they saw the puppy that I used

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:36,990
for the project because as like agreed

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:50,640
all a state just make changes now the

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:54,860
less you use okay so first that

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,809
are in my mommy that if we have

00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,779
all right has experience actually I

00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:05,699
don't have I don't think it's such a

00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:09,870
huge traffic coming for because most of

00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:12,660
a developer we develop website maybe one

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,579
hand you have a can use a hundred user

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,220
to your websites or any recording we

00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,649
have already you know at the time we

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,370
were not only facing the future of the

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,959
traffic to coming in our website but

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:29,120
we're also facing some of the cyber

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,120
egghead from you-know-who

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:40,499
so when goes already with it I mean is

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:45,629
already now and think about the solution

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:49,730
that we have so this is the solution

00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:53,790
that we use in the final stage first we

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:56,370
tie our domain durable calm and we use

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,529
the healthcare thanks town Freya do an

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:03,559
amazing job to protect us from the evil

00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:07,079
sect so we just pay a few maybe they

00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:12,439
package 20 bucks a month and then you

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,439
will actually they have got to actually

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,790
there was detect whether this IP

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:24,269
inspector or locking is from chat with

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,920
all the time we have a love attack from

00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,639
Russia and China

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,319
so most of most of a traffic attack is

00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,449
from this to country are gonna work so

00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:39,240
evident we decide to use them were cloud

00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:43,470
platform is because the doodle is

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,709
allowed us to actually to change how a

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:50,850
shield ability when we need the mesh

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:54,029
machine hi for example when this time

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,540
you if you have a low budget opening you

00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:59,510
have you need you have you can

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,380
- he was more machine with the one CPU

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:06,260
but at the time you have a lot of

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:09,080
traffic coming out you want to at the

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:13,250
time you you are able to happen your

00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:16,220
machine seamlessly easily by maybe

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:19,310
Makena having it then you can operate a

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,610
machine from one CPU up to I mean it

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,700
gives vu h 0 cpu machine is a pure

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,930
worship of course your customers well

00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,990
because there as well you can buy

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,930
miniature how many resources a usual

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:37,670
Google so my actress poonam is because

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,740
the economy is a lower than necessary

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:43,250
that they have and the Google platform

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:54,020
is when YouTube and the genial host I'm

00:14:43,250 --> 00:15:15,620
so hot 15 Google from another world the

00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:19,580
nearest Singapore so this is how I how I

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,770
separate my wordpress into 3 different

00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,470
server Estolano

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:27,500
remember develop a website we use

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:32,290
WordPress to develop a website we will

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,290
actually put everything database

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:45,770
so and I would know Jai our ads and we

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:49,460
put all in one server so it's actually

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:52,190
easily to hit up the server and they

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,460
were it easily but not the server so

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:59,000
this is how I actually speak the truth

00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,860
even have from application to 3

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,100
different

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,950
which is all Google have a provide a

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:10,510
signature or already have first of all

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:13,570
first I will put my answer will X over I

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:16,740
put it on compute engine

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:19,660
later I will show you how easily you can

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:24,210
you can you can start a website using

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:28,450
the computer over mg and a secondly I

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:32,970
leave my MySQL server to the cloud SQL

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:34,900
server and Google cow accessible because

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,420
it's Google

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:41,700
so you actually you're no need to worry

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:47,470
about over here okay there were scale

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:50,350
using the actually Gina and the turbine

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:55,000
is the company content I sporting all

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:57,100
the music storage back-end server so any

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,350
if you if you if you can we do the

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,600
Google cloud platform Road absolutely

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,510
you know that this storage pocket is

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,150
actually like a G Drive it's time to

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,610
track you can store everything so you

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:13,480
can separate actually you double people

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:15,760
can your English file to this storage a

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:23,140
key server so the advantage to doing

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:26,260
this is actually when this one the x

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,140
over you suddenly you get a lot of huge

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:34,870
to us coming in you can actually use

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:38,740
good answer and separate from from from

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:45,220
from you can have on your machine time

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:46,990
to time to - yeah to face the challenge

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,710
you have alright so this is the time

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:53,350
where you have the pencil

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,929
say you okay staring contest different

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,240
machine and actually because but this

00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,870
machine is not this database not on the

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,570
same machine

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,299
we saw somewhere out so you can actually

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:09,210
use the database and how much I'll see

00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:21,370
sir and you can actually handle traffic

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:28,149
all right so this is so again this is

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:32,470
the packing this is I use a high so

00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:34,840
maybe this is not a good that the best

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,720
solution for a bar so what best

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,169
experience I know there have and they

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:49,960
have something called darker every any

00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:53,350
kind yes so they have another advanced

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:58,330
technology to big comedy to actually

00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:01,990
scary yeah yeah machine so I will do a

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,779
quick demo and how you can set up your

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:25,330
WordPress in a Google Cloud moment in a

00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:29,440
few minutes so yeah this is my personal

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:39,549
alright so after that you could with the

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:42,039
console and the time you will see on

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:44,010
this wall everything how complex the

00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,600
resources that you consume for your

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:53,169
website and then you go to the compute

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:56,080
engine VM instances once you select

00:19:53,169 --> 00:20:08,470
instances you click on the create is

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:10,210
this and you have you okay and then of

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,380
course mother just a lot of our lives

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,120
I'm trying to say is usually you what

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:22,450
we'll be thinking about the self website

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:24,279
as a server entry and installed a saloon

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,389
we have to install - if I had me

00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:31,710
everything but hang up Google they have

00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:35,520
one amazing features called

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:39,190
things so this is a marketplace so

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:43,389
that's what all right

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:51,000
compute engine we only virtual machine

00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:51,000
instance yes okay three instance

00:20:51,750 --> 00:21:01,309
we're so this base magic comes well you

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:03,360
go to the marketplace and you search for

00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:09,570
you know look breasts

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:11,750
yes that was not option of this one but

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:15,539
what I recommend is a reduced this one

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,880
WordPress a Yankee so it's actually you

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:21,390
with the latest PHP server pusher and

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:27,510
then you can actually just a click away

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:28,890
launch our the cool grateful and then

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,559
you can choose with the type of machine

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,230
and this is important you have to choose

00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:37,460
your jewel complete because this is a

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:42,059
ring this is very important that you

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:45,150
next time you connect before putting on

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:48,809
the same river a state region so one

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:54,240
good way so just when you do interest

00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:58,110
rate and then the Machine stay after

00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,960
self you were XOR the consumer in sort

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:03,720
of HP when you start OS you will install

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,510
the blue press Australia you will store

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,740
the past year the very initial stage for

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,559
you

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,950
[Music]

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,450
initially rather so you see just this

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,849
one you would think about three minutes

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:25,759
for example machine as soon as the

00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:28,700
machine you sell so yeah as soon as you

00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:32,659
got me IP so see how fast and how

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:37,659
convenient the blue carpet law given

00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:42,229
good so this is the one yeah that's it

00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:44,229
so you can have your own self host

00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:50,109
website or the Google cloud platform

00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:50,109
just begin three minutes so this is

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:10,470
it's because its host on the Google

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:13,870
horse on the US it's maybe the same

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,420
server with LoPresto when you do the

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,180
update you know who the party

00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:21,640
essentially is superfast it stretches

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,650
the purpose right so this is the demo

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,230
day we have to stamp your website

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:30,010
including lists on the Google cloud the

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:34,780
decimal I will show you just now we say

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:37,030
that we offer our SQL Server in a

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:40,300
different server right so I will show

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:45,340
you at the same in terms of how we can

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:55,200
set our SQL Server between family means

00:23:45,340 --> 00:24:01,630
so same you go to the dashboard choose

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:06,940
the SQL Server so you choose SQL Server

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:10,870
and increase the instances as same as

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,090
what we had before then you can choose

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,800
the bigger solution or you can choose

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,510
the spectrum second request ask you a

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:22,080
second generation generation question

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,080
makes the option

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,610
instead of hustling if you do if you

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:35,690
want to give them all over then you can

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,690
actually give you blind

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:42,929
this is a region that I imagine just now

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,120
you have to make sure your highest

00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:48,230
chances are going to see in the same

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:52,170
region that you're watching fishing it

00:24:48,230 --> 00:25:03,960
is for the same same same signature if

00:24:52,170 --> 00:25:10,260
they are so they are setting up this is

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:14,850
no longer there so they actually set up

00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:17,610
the master server every Wednesday to

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:20,130
have this is a very just capacity for

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:27,260
the astronaut workers right into any

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:31,559
others lodging into any others but

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:33,840
instead as a surprise to you so you can

00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:37,230
actually separate the three different

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,610
half of your oppress and I mean in the

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,610
three different server

00:25:40,980 --> 00:26:00,870
so this is kind of kind of shot every

00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:04,680
time I sing a song it's actually

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:09,600
thinking is whatever to ourselves so

00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:15,480
yeah under the musing race on the time

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:20,130
maybe maybe to the effect from this TV

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,500
so actually is really amazing race is

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:34,530
your guy if you remember if you want to

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:36,900
know how a story on YouTube and

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,390
solutions for The Amazing Race Malaysia

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,280
when I shouldn't redevelop integrase so

00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:46,950
you can have you can know the real

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:49,800
people how we carried the banner meet

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:53,100
the people many other people are mean

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,290
another stranger on the plane that HD

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,260
vision you know each other on the track

00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:01,830
very touching moment is you are actually

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:04,010
handed a placid and other stranger in a

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:07,050
black

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:12,780
you know that you don't know what is

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:15,630
inside the envelope is probably and so

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:18,950
you know but all the time actually

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:36,690
people trust each other very well so

00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:43,770
they are willing to if if let's say you

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:46,530
want to so if you if you duplicate

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:48,510
another server that's how about your

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:54,930
database you can do it on the real time

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:58,650
so this is why we separate to another

00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:01,710
server so this is when you add on three

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,780
ship formation team you sister if you

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:08,430
sue people shared state penalties so

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:11,400
this is what we so okay

00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:17,520
after you have our standard server the

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:25,050
last thing is connect your server to the

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:28,350
server so this very simple so it just

00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:30,900
show picture a few code actually is

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,960
actually thing a lot of what you need

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:38,820
you need to have knowledge about how you

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:42,440
can attach some knowledge how you can

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,440
use the hi

00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:50,090
and come on music are you saying the

00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:52,340
basement come on to do other things so

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:56,600
this is the finder that you actually

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,529
just change on localhost a good this is

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,470
a beauty

00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:05,110
let's copy the HP you change your local

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:09,799
host to the IP that you have just now

00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:12,740
alright so this is basically order which

00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,669
is all the mechanism is work on the

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,110
pyramid on top

00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:20,899
thank you and again thanks for the what

00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,430
you need if you plan to have 20 here to

00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:28,670
share my experience
