one thing they wanted wanted I suggest

00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:13,400
that is that why maybe wonder why they

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,820
need a block when there are some social

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,310
media to market her site right so these

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,200
are a few of my thoughts so one thing is

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,230
that is kindness what you put on

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,850
Instagram right now is hot today but if

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,300
you put it on the blog let's say I would

00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,390
like my chocolate recipe and it's always

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,230
going to be there and when people search

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,000
on SEO it can find you on the goal

00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,940
especially if your site is so I just

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,640
want to say that there is a place for

00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,290
blogs view it's not often some social

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,270
media influences that I know it's

00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,880
important if not anymore you can just

00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,920
going from like Instagram post but I

00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,290
think it's this you cannot talk in them

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,570
about the topic nobody knows about your

00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:04,399
whole ideas when they want to find um

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:09,500
say the recipe okay recently I'm

00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:11,840
interested to sell them piano so I go to

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,450
a lot of sites and then they and Enright

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,850
what I do is that we sell those piano

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,530
classes to you but I found them through

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:26,080
how to read skills in in a short time so

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,080
I think don't provides that platform oh

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,380
and then the thing is this Facebook has

00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,450
been around for many years but then the

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,250
thing is we cannot all Instagram but we

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,070
cannot have

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:42,550
because it's not our site so let's say

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:45,880
your entire business depends on that

00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,890
when they change that algorithm or when

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,220
they suddenly venue for whatever reason

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,540
and you're not on Facebook then it will

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,440
affect your business so I think it's

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,960
very important with a couple and make

00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,580
sure that it's high on su so like you

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,490
have in control we don't have to depend

00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:12,670
on like another platform another person

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:14,890
to to help promote yourself how I got

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,140
all this work is because I show what I

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,060
can do to other people I do it I don't

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,260
just say what I can do

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:26,260
so one book that we like it's called

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,720
show your work and I think I'm a little

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,750
embarrassed to show what I can do

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,180
but then after reading the book and

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,370
especially this quote it's not enough to

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,260
be good in order to be found you have to

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,250
be findable so it's very important to

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,380
put your work online even said right

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,590
that it is not online that it does not

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,590
exist

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:57,420
so I draw this entire species I draw

00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,569
from my own experience so I'm just gonna

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,230
do what I did and then I hope that you

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,180
can apply the same technique to your own

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,680
work

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:12,389
so first is that I shared my recipes I

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,139
think good photos and I could like all

00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:21,000
the information up and then I think

00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:24,629
really nice photos of my food and then I

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,680
try stuff like new ideas of relating to

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:32,609
look like food hacks so this one it's I

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,069
like to do in photography and this one

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,239
is how okay I came up with the idea

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:37,949
because you need Chinese New Year you

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,109
have to peel the onion oranges and not

00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,000
only Chinese New Year you will have my

00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:43,919
nice manicure or you look your best and

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,780
I don't want to spoil my manager so I

00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,209
thought hey maybe we can use the knife

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,959
to view this and then I roll it up and

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,069
this got really popular on a bust fee

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,540
what happened was there's so much

00:03:53,069 --> 00:04:00,389
traffic tied by my side first down yep

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,319
so that is I think this battling did

00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,790
help me with as you

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,230
so I share my ideas it know like the

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,599
interesting ones yeah

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,420
what you can do is that ask yourself

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,630
what work do you - what can you show

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,090
what can you put in your blog you might

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,669
think that it's very simple but it's

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:26,750
simple to you but not to other people

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:28,430
and have you put it online if you've got

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:33,790
an interesting idea have you put it

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,790
online if not how can you do that I

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,630
highly recommend this book for for the

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,630
encouragement

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,639
so for this recipes because I show that

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,040
I can create recipes when I approach and

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,200
each popular and we talked a can we

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,690
maybe create a cookbook together and I

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,669
just said this these are my recipes they

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,760
know that I can do it so that got me co

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:20,040
boots and for photos I worked with I

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,320
have heard before and I create a new

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,060
sensor along with the photos so because

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,250
they know that I've got these ideas and

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm able to take photos I managed to get

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:36,540
those consulting work okay second is how

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,850
can you create your online portfolio so

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,690
it is what I do

00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:44,940
Murphy I spend some time and money to

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,250
create a good website so before that I

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,710
was just doing it on my own because you

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,630
can do me but if you can create a

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,720
professional one it makes a huge

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,720
difference

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,389
so like just now ideas create content

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,550
create the blog so what I do is that I

00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:11,249
put two websites one is Joule pie it's a

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:15,089
more lifestyle based and another one is

00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:18,270
totally focusing on on articles or now

00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:21,599
sorry recipes and then I have to serve

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:26,819
each page to show it what I can do and

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:29,610
this one I put most of my work photos

00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:34,559
recipes and stuff up there and when I

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:37,319
talk to my potential client I will send

00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:39,059
them a separate portfolio but it's like

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,089
a sneak peek he put a sneak peek of what

00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:49,469
you can do on your website and then what

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:52,249
if you're if you're in media just put it

00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:55,439
up I don't know why people will be a bit

00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:57,509
impressed if you're if you're shown in

00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:03,809
the media so if you have any just put it

00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:06,659
up so take away how is the design of

00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:09,209
your blog do you need to make it a

00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,740
little bit more professional I think

00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:14,309
it's very important that it created us

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,709
let me go back so this is quite recent

00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:19,740
it's because I starts at a cooking

00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:23,159
school and I meet a sec pavement so I

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,409
put a lot of effort in this so my friend

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:27,389
for them before I don't know before

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:29,909
after but this one when someone see

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,089
anything well it looks legit I will put

00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:35,969
my my credit card on it

00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:37,079
so I was told that it's important to

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,300
have something that looks professional

00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,979
and on top of that if you've worked with

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,979
bigger brands put it out there

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:51,470
yes so this takeaway I want you to think

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:55,740
of how is the design of your plotline

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,350
does it look professional what ideas can

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,800
you share through your book do you have

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:05,580
a work with me page and then what

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,030
reputable media client you have can you

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,030
put it up

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,880
I was thinking this session if I can't

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:22,240
talk to someone like a small business

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:25,630
owner and maybe see who would like to

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,880
like take out lot of what you can do to

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:40,620
improve your site through this take away

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:50,890
yeah okay so do you have a website what

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:55,210
what do you do resale of computer-aided

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:57,910
design software and training sensor so

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:02,140
you treat people okay so you sell

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:05,880
classes okay how is the design of your

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,880
blog of your website

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:24,120
okay boy cycle is acad

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:26,430
as well as YS okay I did not know the

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,340
importance of this but once I started to

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:33,750
have a professional-looking website

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:40,040
suddenly there's a lot of bookings okay

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:45,290
I see it yeah it's all right

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:48,840
yeah but I think maybe can be improved

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:54,900
but just like my site is so much to be

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:56,750
improved okay so do you think it great

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:01,710
for us

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:03,510
no okay not sure what do you think that

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,530
you can share on your blog that will

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,530
attract your client

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,329
our customers

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:21,149
training training

00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,149
okay any device offense

00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:28,569
okay so for example if I were to sell my

00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:32,139
cody classes and I know that I I attract

00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:33,909
expect and curious so when tears come or

00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:37,269
what they do they will Google over to

00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:39,639
eat up top maybe top 10 top 10 dishes

00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,619
that you must try in a Malaysia so I can

00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,149
create in my god

00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:44,559
something like that so it's something

00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,969
that you know that your client will

00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:50,409
Google it provides good information

00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:53,409
informative things for them so they come

00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:55,689
for that information and and then they

00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:57,219
see there's a cooking class maybe after

00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:01,089
I try all this food I think go for the

00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:05,669
cooking costume so this is how my dog

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:08,859
helped me with my cooking class work and

00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:11,019
then know what you can do but you have

00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:12,609
to tell them I'm willing to work with

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,569
you so that's what I've got a soui

00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:19,509
services and what would be page yeah I

00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:22,829
put it up there clearly that I'm ready

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:22,829
for these jobs if you want me

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,129
they're how to use your blog for

00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:34,199
marketing see what is the point of

00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,119
marketing so people will know what you

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:39,649
can offer and at the end rec you want to

00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:43,399
sell your product or services all right

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:46,529
okay can people tell me what you sell

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:51,660
what services you provide and what put

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:53,929
that you sell anybody nobody sells

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,929
anything

00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:26,970
potato really I use a lot what to do

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:34,499
about cooking yeah yeah okay web design

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:36,029
services but you need to think of your

00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:38,609
pilot and then what they will probably

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:42,389
search online and what design services

00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:44,279
like focus ideas about how to improve

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:46,619
your website because the thing is maybe

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,659
I will find out how to do it and I

00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:51,059
realized I cannot do it and ever hire

00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:54,359
someone that unbeliever it gives me good

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:57,869

00:12:54,359 --> 00:13:00,749
person yeah how to get business for your

00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:03,160
blog so if this is what I did with my

00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:05,800
god sometimes I just go to brains

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,449
I could have put conferences and I'd see

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,089
that okay it's spread I think and work

00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:13,110
with this friend to create something

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:15,790

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,940
seafood dried seafood and Hubble show in

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,879
Petaling Street actually that is true a

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,009
friend but then with this bread with

00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,920
this topping alright cuz she knows what

00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:30,129
I do that's why I worked that's why she

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,350
hired me but if you don't have someone

00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:35,259

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:38,439

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,779
of know that I saw you at the conference

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,029
I know that you're selling this thing I

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:48,550
saw your website I see that our new

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:51,250
recipes or and right now videos on this

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:54,100
very food videos is very popular and

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,279
would you be displeased on my site like

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,170

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:03,009
this is the video that I've made for

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,389
these friends are you interested yeah so

00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:08,230
that's how you can use your book to

00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:10,750
reach out to client and then on top of

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,939
that right I provide an added value so

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,100
after I create new recipes I told them

00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:19,540
that ok I can put it in my bra

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:21,610
so it helps that my SEO is quite good so

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,699
when you search for say like Maggi mee

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:28,089
goreng it's like on top of the first

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:30,100
page and so I thought that that okay not

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,829
only I can create this recipes for you

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,630
on these videos for you I can also help

00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,569
you market in my blog so when people

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:40,420
search for your for your product at

00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:48,009
least they find it in in like another

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:50,920
site someone else talking about you when

00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,360
I when I'm thinking about starting a

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,230
cooking school I was thinking of like

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,790
the

00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:00,310
and not the name my animal setup Kuala

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,290
Lumpur home cooking I was thinking of my

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,930
idea as to what people would say

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,810
home cooking Kuala Lumpur so that's what

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,610
I was thinking but after a while I

00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:16,200
thought that I'll just like reach on my

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:20,590
bone so I I create a booking phone

00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,840
instead of when you decide and then when

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,840
people come for the recipes they also

00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:29,500
see a cooking class and eat top right

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:33,280
button so this is how I reach my blog

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:36,340
instead of like creating another site so

00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,340
whatever if you have like a blog see how

00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:43,800
you can expand it to something else

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,800
related instead of talking something new

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:55,090
is that it is not a B&B

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:59,470
it maybe takes 20% of the out of e so I

00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:02,980
I treat them as my marketing platform

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:05,470
this this would not earn me as much as

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,540
direct booking but I put it there anyway

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,240
there's a lot of views over there every

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,590
week I think that's 200 this every week

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,690
tower send something to you and say that

00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,870
oh we've got 200 views you've got three

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,300
classes book this week so I put my

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,370
website that though is not a link right

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,920
but other people can see that it is this

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,350
class is only available on like Monday

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,130
to Friday if I want to have like a full

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,110
class or what we get maybe I'll go to

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,230
the side and check out like what what

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,150
else you can offer so this is limited

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:44,530
but it's important that my book that so

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:46,390
I can meet people back this is what I

00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,970
want to say is that if you have a blog

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:51,460
make use of it just tell people that

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,230
okay I've got this side these are all my

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,720
ideas these are things that I can do for

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,060
you is what I have done for the friends

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:04,449
