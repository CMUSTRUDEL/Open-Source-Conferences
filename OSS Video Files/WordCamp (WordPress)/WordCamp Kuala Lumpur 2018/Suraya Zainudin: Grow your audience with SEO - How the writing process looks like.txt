Title: Suraya Zainudin: Grow your audience with SEO - How the writing process looks like
Publication date: 2019-05-13
Playlist: WordCamp Kuala Lumpur 2018
Description: 
	The first time I googled a term and found my article listed as the first result, I was elated. Search engine optimisation does work!
In fact, SEO works so well that it contributes the majority of my website’s traffic. I didn’t have to do extra work to attract 7 out of 10 readers to my humble website. This has convinced me that SEO is the best and cheapest way to get an audience!
In this presentation, I will share how I write articles with SEO in mind. Once you discover the core principle behind it, SEO will become easy and even intuitive to implement.

I'll be giving it up and today I'm how

00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:17,210
to grow your audience using SEO which

00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:19,730
only know is such optimization search

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,700
engine optimization and specifically how

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,360
the writing process looks like sauce I'm

00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,160
a writer

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,830
are you writing it as a hobby which I've

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,379
already monetized but my work is to

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,539
provide competition is work for

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:39,440
companies they do a project or anything

00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:43,579
like that so just to have a quick look

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,900
at how the website looks like that's to

00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:51,649
be you know this is mostly how I get my

00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,950
client so people come in seeing my

00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:57,230
articles online and then I have a patent

00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,489
and like hire me and if you like my

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,500
writing but they usually some of them

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,869
converted into paying clients who

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:10,000
engaged connecting services so that's

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:10,000
what I do for dinner again

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,229
who here agrees with this statement okay

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,780
because if you don't the idea of one is

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:22,729
good though it's not the mission you can

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,450
join that go and no problem at all

00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:29,360
why do you think SEO is important for

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,830
you for medium companies I understand of

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,390
course you want more Chuck speak with

00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,510
moisture pay you can find that your

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,210
audience you can you know most have ads

00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:42,080
you can get sponsored course you can

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:45,170
money from traffic but for there are sub

00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,409
you the the server guys the what temple

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:52,270
at first why do you want you then SEO

00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,270
today but you just want to shout it out

00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:00,030
yeah we traffic free time all right so

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,580
I'm guessing some of you who work little

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,710
bit more technical try you would like to

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,080
implement SEO so that you can get

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,320
clients who will hire you for your

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,830
medical book is AK right right and here

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,870
I would like to tell you those who do

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,380
will incite the technical side of things

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,300
because I mean who create content have

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,530
no idea sometimes when you talk about

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,530
like and this is something that have

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,720
been kind of like a recurring theme so

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,630
whenever I would press meetups for

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,450
example and when it sometimes if it was

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:41,250
things like basic s like the importance

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:43,620
of like caching your your your content

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,350
so that this website speed is faster

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,200
sometimes people that we have no idea so

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,870
and then end of the workshop I'm gonna

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,270
give you guys especially the weapon of

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,980
those are people who target companies

00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,440
media publishing companies and companies

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,560
doing e-commerce on how you can market

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,440

us who are eatable Pesce maybe candidly

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,989
spoken to each other a bit better and

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,090
just to use a cup of ice to let you know

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,690
that I know that the pair of are talking

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,200
about this is a screenshot of my Google

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,200
Analytics

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,449
[Music]

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:10,730
and then I also get a couple of websites

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:15,110
for the website so not begging just

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,410
telling you that so far so good so far

00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,370
so good

00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:26,390
okay okay there are deeper sense of SEO

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:28,490
is you know the writing process but

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:32,210
before that there's a little bit of a

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,800
prep work that you have to do first of

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,470
all keyword research I'm gonna just

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,780
quickly go through this things that you

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,670
cannot have to know what is available

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,090
from focalprice form like building a

00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,800
website making sure that your ex is good

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,550
things my dad the technical aspects

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,710
right this particular shot is not photos

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,740
especially by other couple people

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,830
monitor this is the actual writing

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,730
process first of all you have to know

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,010
your audience

00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:08,210
and this is something that is

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:09,890
surprisingly high for people who blog

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,190
for a living for them

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:16,850
it's surprisingly common for people who

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,700
think that they what they think is the

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,740
most important thing in the world and

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm saying that because there are people

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,290
out there who think that your opinion

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,050
matters above all else I'm sorry to put

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,990
it that bluntly but what people want to

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:36,230
know exactly as a these are educational

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,870
or be is it entertaining so it is not

00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,340
one of these things it is something that

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,409
just you know you

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,150
reach out all your emotions it's

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,009
something that is not together both for

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,840
your audience it has to be helpful and

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,719
the second one is a key word of

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,150
temptation mine so when I mean test and

00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:56,419
there are so many keywords generation

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,249
tools that you can use allow a leader

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:03,360
the third one is that we didn't the blog

00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:05,939
in circles at least daily especially for

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,740
people who are perfectionists right they

00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,289
want to be sure that everything is

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,560
perfect so they don't write anything out

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:18,210
so the first job just believe the first

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,460
draft and then I would say that longer

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:26,789
content is better there's a statistic

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:29,669
that she is that - 1000 2000 3000 word

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:33,330
content it's shared at least three times

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:36,000
more than shopping for content for the

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:41,360
media in the room can you share with me

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,680
how long is usually your article sites

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,650
thousand Wow

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,289
which one that is amazing that you keep

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:53,669
it up keep it up anyone else wanna share

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:57,659
how much mileage awesome keep it up a

00:06:53,669 --> 00:07:00,689
little bit of my story last time I used

00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:03,990
to work as an editor with a platform

00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:06,960
that supplies content for companies so

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,990
that I can be the person right and they

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,759
used to do a lot of keyword stuffing so

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,610
they have all this guideline safety for

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,720
example we saw in Kuala Lumpur all right

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,270
we saw in binding right

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,080
they will put a say okay you said at

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:28,010
least five of this keyword makes us like

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,200
this four hundred words you know major

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,230
to include at least one external links

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:37,340
and as long as the director who

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:40,610
satisfies all that is you know all this

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,800
they will accept it but over the long

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,790
term we found out that none of those

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,290
work because why because he was happy

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,860
doesn't work Google is so much smarter

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,260
than that

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,700
so the point that I'm trying to make is

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,970
that quality always Trump's quantity of

00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,710
content and here's a good tip for you

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,600
you have to answer as many questions as

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,970
you can about the company and this is

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,210
something that made me content out there

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,950
do not address so if say for example

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:16,190
what does somebody want to shout out an

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:18,890
industry that again web design okay

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,350
questions about Web Design I would like

00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,590
to know for example how much is the

00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,320
price how much is the timeline how how

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:30,050
long how is the steps are usually like

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,840
by in minutes of their website in the

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,690
end about web design I can usually see

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,280
that there is especially - of the ones

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:43,580
they are usually you know they are very

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,290
promotional just for one when we what

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,410
people would like to notice like a more

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,870
like a broke one this right this is

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,610
something that I always use when I talk

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,060
about content is a really really good

00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:00,640
website but uncertain at publix.com and

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,640
it's a bit too small but it can

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,190
different synonyms of the world

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,430
security tips for using sometimes some

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,220
things like that and the oil content

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:43,270
with insert answers that the public

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,970
wants to know the better days so until

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:48,100
now I've covered how the first step of

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,800
the writing process but this is where

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,920
the magic happens which is the editing

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,230
process a spiraling number of content

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,540
leaders do not edit your work

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,380
unfortunately and when they do an edit

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,140
your work there's a lot of another typos

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:08,560
a lot of grammatical errors formatting

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:11,620
lightly there's a lot of the key words

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,680
that they use are not consistent well so

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,680
here I want to show you how I do step by

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,020
step after the first by just now which

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,200
is just in fact why not because just

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,960
kind of bring down what I have already

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,160
written so I have a drop say for example

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,380
2,000 words and then when I uploaded

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,930
inside WordPress first of all we have to

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:38,440
insert a keyword inside the permalink

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:43,750
which is on top a surprising number of

00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:47,170
websites still use but a number of

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,960
websites are that still use after they

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:54,160
are calm still have like an additional

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:56,650
length 2018 slash you know they did you

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,290
don't need that take it away right the

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,180
shorter the better half so now that you

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,030
know in this particular example it's an

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,890
article that we tend about visas so and

00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,760
very specifically about the price of

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,950
business in Malaysia and insider for my

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,450
late romantic SR the keyword which is

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,240
pictures cost of Malaysia

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,450
I added it inside the pipe and I added

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,040
it inside the image jr. Outernet packs

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,770
who here doesn't know what is our

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,520
context a third offense

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,470
okay let's zoom everyone knows

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,220
everything and then there's people at

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,399
the end which

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,279
so you need them okay

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,019
so during your editing process obviously

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,660
you want to maintain your spider

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,670
fighting every platform have their own

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,459
voice their own style meaning that

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,889
because that makes your but that's what

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,899
will bring your projects back to you but

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:49,540
what you can do is during the editing

00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:51,639
process as much as possible your

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,339
keywords always put it in the first few

00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:58,180
paragraphs so that Google will be really

00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:00,069
knowledge that this topic this this

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,540
article includes this topic and

00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:04,540
therefore will rank it higher in the

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,379
search engine always put also a DS

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,699
throughout there's a finite number of

00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:12,610
content out there which does not use

00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,889
hitting is does not use bullet points

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,600
for example things that make it easier

00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:21,519
for the audience will you so it's all

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,379
about readability right also in this

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,220
particular case is about visas

00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,410
co-simulation

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,810
also tweak your alternative keywords so

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,850
for example inside clear they are also

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,709
costs are found then reading that is

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,930
conventional business cost information

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:37,480
for example and that one excess

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,850
concentration further down it's like if

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,559
there's a line basis consideration so

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,420
because what that four key in those

00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:48,029
keywords as well there's a highly likely

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:51,309
drop for them to find your website right

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:52,839
and of course use short paragraph you

00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:55,029
see things use pull the points things

00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,059
that makes it easier for people to find

00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:01,689
you and always inside a website and your

00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:04,660
internal links other content that you've

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:07,839
written inside your gut right and also

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,379
externally probably from a very strong

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,970
website so entirety chose to go that you

00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:14,379
are linking it not to like spammy

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,149
websites but let's talk about citing

00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:18,149
some so that helps your ranking as well

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,500
yeah I want to share with you what if

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,410
sometimes the especially if you do like

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:33,090
a long keyword right sometimes they are

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:35,460
we in I will give you one example this

00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,960
one the keywords are a side income

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,880
Malaysia there's no way I can put that

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,280
natively inside an article I can't just

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,120
put on do you want cycling combination

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,470
it does go a chromatic it is incorrect

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,570
but what you can do it has a few tips

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,930
that you can that you can implement so

00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,770
that your article will still rank high

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,290
on SEO

00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,880
the first one would be still of course

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,420
to it in your insert it in your

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,460
permalink and things like that

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:09,630
add more images because the more images

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,120
you have one thing is that you can put

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,880
them at the afternoon as the

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,830
after-effects right and as far as

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,510
possible these are the types of articles

00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,970
that you wanna make sure that the

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:24,600
quality is even more than your other

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:27,420
post if your she would interfere right

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,420
and when I say ensure could be the

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,210

00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,500

for Malaysia if you don't know we use

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:50,310

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,399
do what is right and it is well you

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:58,220

00:15:53,399 --> 00:16:00,870
your typos your if you have like passive

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,689
passive sentences they will suggest it

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,269
to change it to active sentences they

00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:11,189
check for like sentence structure and in

00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,829
fact he also you can move around with

00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:18,139
sentences before you update the final

00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:18,139
version inside inside

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,579
[Music]

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,170
they also have a Google closure setting

00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:34,550
when you can edit

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:37,560
from your WordPress to get them back and

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:41,279
another one that I use having me at the

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:45,300
coffee this is really good to ensure

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:49,320
good readability it will also show you

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:52,740
how if it's easy for people to read or

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,029
not one of the things that one of the I

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,130
would say diseases that many

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,269
contemporary to speak is that because

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,000
they want to make themselves sound

00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:02,430
clever so that people will engage within

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,100
services they're just confusing your

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,970
audience instead of using a simple word

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,850
like you know like teach they would use

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,189
something like to facilitate it means

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:16,260
the same thing but it's the simpler

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:19,770
words that you use especially if you are

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,199
b2c kind of business model where your

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,540
audience is person using the you know

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,819
they men's language this employee your

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:30,090
voice the easier it is for you to get

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:34,500
values in fact the reason why I think

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:37,140
that the website does kabilov okay is

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,169
that I have broken down financial

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,840
chatons into easy-to-understand language

00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:46,190
so that's why it's a popular cookie I

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,190
want to share with you

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:54,770
at first we recommend this is called on

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,020
writing world then trusty guide to

00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:01,240
writing nonfiction I highly highly

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:04,760
recommend this book written by William

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,540
Simms and he has more than like a

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,720
million copies sold and this is

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,160
something that it's very easy to read

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,410
you know we didn't one week that you can

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,190
probably finish it but we'll give you

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:22,130
the key steps that you can use to write

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,590
your business especially if you want to

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,480
distribute it to the most mass audience

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:31,250
so they will give you some examples

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,170
where how you know what kind of mistakes

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,960
that that people in the technical

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,670
industry use for example when they write

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,040
their content and what kind of

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,210
suggestions you can use instead of using

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,970
those words so that people can

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,510
understand why try to see so highly

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,510
recommended

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,200
all right

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,300
I hear I would like to just know and we

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,610
have any other suggestions this is

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,910
pretty much only you see us 2.0 body

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,710
plug-in that I checked 4-0 right and

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:08,520
then screen and a stays green of like

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,650
everyone up a patient but as anyone who

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,770
want to share how else do you check

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:18,080
whether you're actually always good or

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:18,080
you actually always good enough for you

00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:27,510
okay again I want to stretch that

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,700
quality of content matters more than the

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,040
quantity of your content right the

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,500
longer it is the more questions you

00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,260
answer the more helpful you are to your

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,210
audience the more simpler than we should

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,160
have people to understand the more

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,670
people that link to you and the more

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,160
that you do learn the Google were

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,559
recognized that your website is good and

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,340
therefore rank it higher let's promote

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:55,470
the only strategy that I use right but

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,290
at the same time also don't ignore the

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:01,200
technical aspects during the prep book

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:05,340
during this night can I do you but how

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,470
about the technical aspects I I cannot

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:12,510
vouch that I probably can actually say

00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,860
this but he said I think give me six

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,510
hours to chop down that she and I were

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,540
spent the first four hours sharpening

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,190
the knife implemented into the full

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,280
content creation and distribution

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:26,490
strategy if you have all of your back

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,809
work in place the easier it is for your

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:36,050
article to do the right things in terms

00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:38,970
of SEO so yes here's the problem though

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,820
look at how this textbook who knows what

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,860
it's my tech by the way marketing type

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,110
exactly I just found out earlier this

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,460
year I had no idea this will exist and

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:53,670
do you know what I was researching this

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:56,730
right now I saw right now companies have

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,700
started to spend more on marketing

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,480
technology tools instead of the amount

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,059
they spend on marketing personnel for

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,190
salaries for you know for people it is

00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,350
highly we think more that those have

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,600
taken over in terms of spending among

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,270
and he's only gonna get high like me

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,309
from now on if you see that child I

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,490
think that a couple of is before this is

00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:23,040
only about a few thousand only only a

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,620
few thousand by not as more than 5,000

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,380
marketing analytic tools I would like to

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,760
say that as content rate this you should

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,770
know and keep up with marketing

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,980
technology but it's pretty much

00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:39,780
impossible let's be safe so what you can

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,940
do instead is and I would like to to

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,460
share with you some common problems that

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,760
content creator space because again in

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,320
the beginning I asked if who are who is

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,320
in our audience so on one side they are

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,790
the content creators right and people

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,320
who's doing an accretion and sleep

00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,140
generation strategies under on either

00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,330
hand there are people there are the

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,910
technical people who are selling you

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,700
know web design and plugins and tools

00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:09,150
and teams right who would like to work

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,290
together more with the content Cletus in

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,360
order to make it better

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,250
but during my whole blogging process

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,410
here's some problem that I personally

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,220
face first of all I started out with

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,720
reading and then when I switched to it I

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,820
didn't have an idea on how to my game of

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,700
big hosting providers and when I talk to

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,220
my friends they say that oh why am i can

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,830
change hosting providers in my sleep

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,440
so do you see the gap in knowledge that

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,040
we have here right in terms of website

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,870
design where can you buy teams and then

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,220
I figure out oh wow there are market

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,750
places right it might sound like super

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,490
obvious for you now but wait that word

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,770
is coming on your market is that sound

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,360
teams when I first started college I

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,640
didn't know that you can fight it if I

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,030
have to drive it from scratch right in

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,120
terms of packets we started to you

00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:02,330
what types of them are they and how do

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,460
you make sure that they do not clash

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:08,120
with each other and are they compatible

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:11,050
with your website right again some

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,230
problems yes guys what the hell are them

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:16,850
we're happy so sometimes when you read

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,300
right so I take to DNI where everything

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,120
myself

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:23,960
right then was identifying okay how to

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:26,630
access to do to get the email such paper

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,220
is for example finally some coding

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,350
brought me to some cheap huh

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:35,000
do you not know what are you talking

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:37,610
about so what developers I could give

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,360
you some citizen finish work to optimize

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:43,490
for like for content creators sometimes

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,530
we don't really want to know into the

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:49,160
nitty-gritty stuff we just want to know

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:53,050

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,459
what our liking into a website

00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:50,440
recommendations of what you can improve

00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:53,139
I would suggest for you to go to at

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,639
least two people so that is I going to

00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:56,649
doctor I getting different opinions

00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:58,299
right and that from then on you can make

00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:00,369
you have a budget okay I want to improve

00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:03,700
this aspect for example should be I have

00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:05,799
a budget obviously 5000 million what can

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,729
you give me for this particular price

00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:11,559
point and then yeah for workers or so

00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:14,559
therefore the pears are the guys that I

00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,179
see out there this make it simpler for

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,149
people like me to understand this is

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:21,399
like like a series but it happened has

00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:25,079
been okay I would like to live here for

00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:25,079
questions and answers if you have any

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,440
if you actually only did eight questions

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:50,649

00:27:50,649 --> 00:28:05,409
in here

00:27:53,230 --> 00:28:07,179
good question I cannot but the basic

00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:09,009
implementation still works so if you put

00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,600
them in the permalink as you put it in

00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:12,669
the exciting images when you're after

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,159
artifacts if you put in final fittings

00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:17,470
so even though it's like create because

00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,889
they don't recognize very language it's

00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,889
over

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,549
[Music]

the plug-in for making and social media

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:52,450
community so we have each other to

00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,399
improve our work improve our formatting

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,600
give each other feedback in that

00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,210
capacity in terms of providing work for

companies for project voice I have done

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:07,950
that before

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,950
but in my own personal capacity yeah

00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:34,940
I'm commenting I don't do it actively no
