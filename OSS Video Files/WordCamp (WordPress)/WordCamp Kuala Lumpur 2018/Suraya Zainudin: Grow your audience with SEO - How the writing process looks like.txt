Description: 
	The first time I googled a term and found my article listed as the first result, I was elated. Search engine optimisation does work!
In fact, SEO works so well that it contributes the majority of my website’s traffic. I didn’t have to do extra work to attract 7 out of 10 readers to my humble website. This has convinced me that SEO is the best and cheapest way to get an audience!
