I won't use the podium because Trump guy

00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:18,789
blasphemy oh please man yeah so my name

00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:22,750
is suffice my students probabilities but

00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:26,789
your behalf is so I work in your face

00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:33,160
light as a senior lecturer and I

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:36,129
teaching education technology for so you

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,039
PSI is the premier education university

00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:41,319
in malaysia we are the largest producer

00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,620
of each a signature so we were

00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:46,510
previously the future college teacher

00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:51,039
training college team now we keep up to

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,260
the university so I think that bit about

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,159
me before we start I mean how could I

00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:59,289
that that simply means I thought myself

00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:03,579
but from Cody I thought myself up to

00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:10,869
date you know so if you have you know

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:15,009
every developer said then do you have a

00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:16,980
formal education or you know Cody or do

00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:21,950
you rely on

00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,950
Sage's web searches the YouTube videos

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:30,719
both over okay so you might as well you

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,829
know I have a inaudible diagram all

00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,229
right

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,859
I'm also who goes if I traitor so I

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:41,549
trained also Richards how to use Google

00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,829
products especially Google Suites in

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:49,829
teaching and learning and I started

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:55,280
using WordPress in 2011 as a user that I

00:01:49,829 --> 00:02:02,399
use you know the free version and I

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:05,189
realized that one time but I still see

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,810
what WordPress developer when it was

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:13,349
around 2014-2015

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:20,420
right and I have my university listening

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:20,420
to it all you know jump to WordPress

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:27,780
websites my research and development

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:32,359
interests are as you can see on an

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,950
innate ability you respond to AI

00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:39,060
application of area and a are education

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:43,950
and also new technologies but enough

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:48,230
about me so I'm here to talk about how

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,300
we use WordPress in education

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:55,530
specifically Howard press can fit in

00:02:51,300 --> 00:03:00,030
the needs of heaters right so this is an

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:03,810
academic life decide so generally we

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:08,420
have these five responsibilities what

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:12,120
you may have experience with educators

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,730
probably one of them to cheat right but

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,800
we also have especially in you know

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,720
higher education institutions we have

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,840
other rules like oh we need to do

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,490
research we need to apply for grants and

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,460
so public you know the results of the

00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:33,330
research and also we do consultation and

00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:38,460
purity service I would focus on all of

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:42,480
the rules in this talk I focus will just

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,970
do research and publication plus I will

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,270
share with you a bit of a you know not

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,200
to say that line I will share a model

00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:58,230
that I use when developing or managing

00:03:51,200 --> 00:04:03,360
web development projects so WordPress in

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,459
research and publication so this is the

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,500
sharing of my experience I would

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,500
previously you know a doctor

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,930
you still what you get and during that

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,930
time was three and a half year or

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,239
subpoena jÃ¡vea there and I need to

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,580
support myself but from you know the

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,460
allowances given by the government isn't

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,300
me you know much to support me and might

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,979
be there

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:35,400
so I luckily I you know managed to get a

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,810
job in the university itself as academic

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,070
technology project developer who is

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:43,009
essentially who's that developer you

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,630
entertain the customer you first

00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:47,580
analyzes what what their needs and then

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,780
designed to be better they deliver the

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,940
product so in UK they have this

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,300
architect research excellence framework

00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,539
so in RDF they have a requirement for

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,520
each and every research project they

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:07,340
need to publish the findings to the

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:11,220
public make the findings of the research

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:15,229
so one of the ways that they chose was

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:19,409
to build the website and my whole plan

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:23,430
so I will work you research projects

00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:26,180
there and one of the projects I use it

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:31,039
was actually the last project before I

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:34,729
and bTW I use wordpress so that was the

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,919
reading 2014-2015 that was when I

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:42,259
discovered how easy it is to develop

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,990
WordPress website before that before I

00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:50,780
went into I went to to do my PhD I

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:52,660
tapped a bit about using Joomla it was a

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,940
nightmare

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,849
the teacher okay it was a nightmare so

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,009
when I started to use WordPress

00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:06,110
I immediately for dinner for calendar

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:08,840
day so this is one of the earlier

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:12,349
projects that I work on this is one

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:17,509
troop so first when I pick up the road I

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:20,690
focus on the front end so I'm I'm I'm

00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:21,470
that guy who you know transition from a

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,770
graphic designer

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:27,139
to a developer so it's and it's a

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,780
natural progression from you know from

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:32,659
traffic is I need to front to design in

00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:36,820
the front end so I develop you know

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:39,680
decide this front end for this project

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,740
and they're not very likely very much

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,289
the website is very very you know you

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:49,820
think for them because what they have

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:54,260
for this project is a collection of PLA

00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:56,690
Shakespeare like and British Asian we

00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:00,139
would have you know technical role in

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,889
the play on Shakespeare success P so

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,909
they have that kind of database so

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,190
immediately I was thinking when

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:08,300
developing or conceptualizing this

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,629
project I

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,050
thought about thought about you know you

00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:17,539
know do you remember the playing cards

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:21,770
that they have to be used to have like

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:25,009
okay what contract this disease so I

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:30,009
jumped into that kind of my ear and make

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:33,379
these profiles of actors as bankers and

00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:36,889
if you go to that URL you can see the

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:41,180
concept being transferred to a website

00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:44,870
so and then I put on a project for

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:49,280
protection protection project and this

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,750
is on bhoomika if they are ready if you

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,110
have if you haven't heard of it

00:07:50,750 --> 00:08:01,419
Omega is an equivalent of wood press but

00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:05,509
in the museum history arts humanities

00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:09,860
yeah so that's one of the project

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:13,729
front-end and I started dabbling the

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,190
front effect and in this project it's

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:20,360
called Hispanic Liverpool community

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:24,919
collections so in this project I use

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:28,130
kubinka to develop the backend and I

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:33,140
also designed the project if you go to

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,839
the website you can smooth this how he

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,890
is

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:41,579
yes because this is this is the first

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,560
because this was the first project I

00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:48,490
managed to develop front-end and

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:52,680
back-end so it was more of a tinkling

00:08:48,490 --> 00:09:02,529
than developing which shows eternity so

00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:05,050
if you talk but please don't and so this

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:07,839
is the last time so you know everyone

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:12,160
knows the podium right apart so

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:18,820
everybody knows how it was what to do

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:22,620
but know not everyone knows how he went

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:26,019
from the aisle of society to be defeated

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,839
so there was a hundred thing here so

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:33,089
this website documents the hundred days

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:37,060
of his journey so every year starting

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:40,060
26th of February the website will reset

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:47,589
itself and display one night double time

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:50,709
and hundred days so this I this was the

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:55,890
last website I develop with no makeup

00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:55,890
and then I found my true

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:04,320
so this if you can see you can open

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,710
people's history of the NHS this is a

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,820
project if you know any chef delicious

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:16,050
is a it's National Health Services is

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,860
much more like um you know give me a

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,460
high education accessories history of

00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,510
television

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:27,690
so this team this stream of researcher

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:31,080
they document that the history of

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:34,910
penetrance how they develop who founded

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:39,600
it and because this is a community base

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:42,420
so that means I need the community you

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,810
know exclusive members area public air

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,260
and this is also act as encyclopedia and

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:52,470
use it so very much you know a lot of

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,860
things big it into this product and I

00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:00,240
can say that I am proud that I can

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:04,650
deliver this kind of a complexity to do

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,910
to the group and this is you know made

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,930
possible by

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:15,800
if they exist

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:19,430
I love it so so that this is this is the

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:24,019
project requirements they want a virtual

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:26,660
museum and you may get the first meeting

00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:30,800
that I had with a half it's even a

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:33,199
virtual museum that you can walk into so

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,089
that a positive the first project

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:39,860
requirement that they they sent me and

00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:42,050
they want the museum to be a magical to

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:47,899
be very immediately

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:50,839
so for that I spend quite a few so quite

00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:55,519
a few days you're visiting museums

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:59,209
across UK just to understand you know

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,059
what they actually meant by knew going

00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:05,029
into museum and experience a museum so I

00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:08,540
need a lot of groundwork you know we

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:13,939
will study and understand how the UK

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:18,110
people see museum so by doing so and

00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:20,689
understand what what what they want and

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,110
they need to have a community

00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:27,829
contribution and sofa pedia that simply

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:30,410
means they want a front end for and you

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:32,210
can submit to them and they will be new

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:37,860
and

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:43,790
from the members area and we must look

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,790
like to do yoga so as a visual reference

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:53,310
at first it was difficult to convince

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,690
them otherwise very difficult to

00:12:53,310 --> 00:13:01,140
convince them because they have set

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:03,570
their mind I said to them you can't

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:11,270
really look like a newspaper when you

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:14,010
want to put a bit of time to the pizza

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:20,010
at the end I managed to convince them

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:26,550
but I the trade off that I had to do you

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:28,980
know - lets go if you can see how the

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:32,040
New Yorker use the sunshine and Saric

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,780
ones I think that was you know the

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,500
essence of what they are trying to say

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,870
so the larger part of you when you

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,520
communicate with the client you need to

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:46,530
understand what they treat you know

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:50,610
whether they want the locally they want

00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:54,030
the ambience of you know browsing the

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:57,240
website so when I stripped out

00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:07,480
everything and you know if you don't

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:11,680
into this I use serif font for headings

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:18,220
the body Thanks sorry so they say that's

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:22,589
fine okay so some challenges I faced in

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:25,690
this project they wanted me to code it

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:31,540
so that they can you know make a

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:36,370
relationship between objects so more

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:39,730
often when you go to a museum when you

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:43,600
walk into a museum you will be you know

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:46,810
there's a row of usually row of objects

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,769
that are similar in nature so they want

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:53,050
to want to do that because you know they

00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:56,410
they don't want for me to have all the

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:59,790
galleries of the objects but they what

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:03,399
is for them to have a picture or object

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,190
the description of the object and just

00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:10,120
won't be easier there where they can

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:13,769
suggest things that the user might have

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,769
you know might might like to know

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:21,899
money building collection from several

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,589
items so they want to be able to you

00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:30,389
know cook several items and then decide

00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:33,029
item ec z as is what election team under

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,610
probably the founding of the

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:38,449
introduction of an assurance that so

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,670
they want to be able to do that

00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:43,440
Friday night exhibition home sites to

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,810
see member area yeah

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,350
they won an exclusive member area West

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:53,279
where users or audience or visit the

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:57,680
Sangha and they have this exclusive area

00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:02,389
where the members can submit items and

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,449
you know put a marker where the item is

00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:10,440
this is a location-based I took it with

00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:13,259
this location is in displacement map so

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:17,310
that is those are the challenges Sarah

00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:20,430
face so you can imagine how I append my

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:23,399
painful or quite a few times because

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:25,889
this was you know my first WordPress

00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,440
project and it's I think it's very

00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:35,300
complex movie for beginner

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:39,480
but I'm going to put it off so it's not

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:43,050
visible but anyway this is the skeleton

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,430
of the website so we have the

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:50,639
Encyclopedia the block and the museum

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:54,199
that's the front end so the end mean the

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,470
public and the private consent I don't

00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:01,610
miss at the database and a field and

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:04,319
select items and to read a collection of

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:15,270
titles and the relationship between

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:20,159
items so that's that's and the tools

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:22,049
that I used because I'm beginner I can

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:25,189
see the beginner poodle

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:31,500
I just work press of course I use CPU I

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:37,320
stop post at UI and also is this CPT why

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:40,710
and ECF has helped me happy you know

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:47,370
tremendously because of these two

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:50,549
plugins I can do wonders I can have the

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,429
development time almost probably my

00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:56,429
teeth

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:59,640
and for front-end I use underscores and

00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:02,429
started teams and also foundation sites

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,030
I don't use well track because I don't

00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:09,030
know I don't really jack well with the

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:15,540
wheel strap is you know but it's evident

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:17,850
this is just from a prequel so projects

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,790
closer to home so those are the projects

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:25,620
that I've done when I was in Warrick now

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:30,179
when I came back in the UPS I so I

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:33,929
thought that they knew that I can put so

00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:38,429
I was the only television that know some

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:42,840
food so they read immediately and say

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:46,710
this I have a task for you can you try

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,530
and design a website for a very small

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,280
unit they call it the mobility you need

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:57,770
this Mobility unit in charge of you know

00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,350
in exchange students from UK US and

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,960
International Committee and three local

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:07,010
students we have so that you need to

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:12,010
charge of that so they want me to you

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:12,010
know to create a beautiful site for that

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:23,830
so after spent over a month developing

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:28,850
it so I came up with this website

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:31,700
mobility ups ups I lived on my so it's a

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,940
bespoke bespoke website that caters to

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:38,510
the needs of that yogi so that you need

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:41,930
the needs are simple they want to be

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:45,050
able to further faculties in us are to

00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:49,460
submit exchange program or summer camp

00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:51,830
to them electronically and they can they

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,690
can get the application of programs

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,550
submissions of sorry its officials of

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,310
the program and then we review the

00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,560
program and then we can just click roast

00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:05,060
and the program is immediately available

00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,490
from n2 students for the part of the

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:12,340
students they want the students to be

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:16,550
able to browse through the the website

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:19,900
and see all the traps available for them

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:25,150
to apply and then apply online

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:30,429
this is very simple so this is the

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:35,110
skeleton for the mobility website so the

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:38,490
front end that's the student from end

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:42,100
and the bottom there is the faculty

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:49,630
front end they need to sign in and then

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:53,860
submit the program for summer camp so in

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:57,490
the back end that will be will be able

00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,970
to filter or approve you submit the

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:04,390
process they can manage the applications

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:08,529
from the students so it's quite simple

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:12,730
and this I've also used the specs that I

00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:15,909
share with you just now easy fty those

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:20,340
are the two you know what Dean said I

00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:24,670
that I use 30 is using

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:28,440
yeah and this is an ongoing development

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:31,390
it's yes right now don't ever open it

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:40,330
because this is real development

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:43,030
i I think the suck ICP is - I still in

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:49,300
development so this is my faculty

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:54,250
faculty of development so I have my

00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:59,650
faculty to develop the website Oh before

00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:05,410
that before coming to this when I

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:08,530
presented this to my university that was

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,010
when they decided to problem lock in

00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,010
WordPress

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:23,410
instrumental all right okay so that is

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:30,310
why I am working on this my faculties

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:32,920
website so for academic purposes for

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:36,160
faculty if you want to approach if you

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,890
are a service provider your design

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,100
company design developer company if you

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:44,470
want to approach a faculty in a

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,920
university you need to understand how

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:52,210
they work so on I'm giving you the tips

00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:56,710
and tricks so in a faculty they will

00:22:52,210 --> 00:23:00,430
have stuffs programs of research and

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:02,290
publication 2004 and consultation those

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:08,650
those are the more you know business of

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:13,470
a faculty so if you look closer the

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:17,290
stuff and the people six at the core and

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:20,710
from the people it develop into programs

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:23,590
because these people academic stuff such

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:27,090
as programs academic stuff produce

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:30,130
publications and research academic stuff

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,860
you know to consultations so if you

00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:35,110
think about you know creating a custom

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:38,850
post type it should be stuff at the

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,850
center and then

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:47,440
so that's how I'm developing the website

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:51,170
right now just for the sake of you know

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,380
the data because you can think if you do

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:58,370
that that you can link publication to

00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:02,990
research easily with oxidation with the

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:16,430
same not to say C but you have an

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:20,030
education yeah so I forgot what what

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:24,410
what tiny be detailed the framework I

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:29,120
use the model that I use for developing

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:31,660
any kind of projects ad ie if this is

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,270
new to you this is a part of

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:38,240
instructional system design I teach and

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:41,630
teaching this to my students it's not

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,090
it's not really meant exclusively for

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:47,540
education you can use this for any kind

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,290
of development web development product

00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,720
development

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,970
any

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,650
development so the first thing is

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,080
analyze of course you have to analyze

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,210
your clients your client's needs

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:01,070
especially your audience you have to

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:06,419
understand who will visit the website

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:09,679
website and unless the design like what

00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:12,419
we have just now the month the 40-plus

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,169
requirements so that you need to take

00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:19,620
into consideration and developments and

00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:22,289
Boop's analyze what's actually the fact

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,140
that we all you know your clients pool

00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:28,320
and develop the project around back

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,520
after that design do a design free form

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:37,080
or cup and establish a visual you know

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:40,380
and check to the client so that when you

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,299
start developing your I would say I want

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,230
to change someone to ethics

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:50,340
I can see small pieces it's it's really

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:54,030
it's really you know for them you say

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:57,230
when they say ok I I would like to have

00:25:54,030 --> 00:26:00,460
this feature what this fashion features

00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:04,549
it's not really that simple

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:07,900
and that things when you are cut the

00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:10,880
developing so for cup first you can use

00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:15,350
envision mock-up just present to them

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:19,700
that was what I did when I when I did

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:22,250
the history of NHS I presented to them

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,549
and I give me that with them because

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:27,410
they questioned me why did this for why

00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,990
this for why this car

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:34,400
why this spectrum they questioned

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:37,669
everything they need to understand why

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,850
why was the theory behind this and as a

00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:43,780
developer come the condition I need to

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:48,500
you know to dig deeper

00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:55,750
like for example I use the above food

00:26:48,500 --> 00:27:01,250
kind of like theory of it's like food

00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:04,960
with the concept right so I when they

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,070
true questions to be all true concepts

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,809
you don't want me you can't convince

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:14,059
that for you sir okay alright so and

00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:16,549
then you develop actual development and

00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:19,280
then you need to adhere to the

00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:20,350
milestones and report to the guidance at

00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,430
that

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,320
so this is this is a progress right now

00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,790
that's a bad way

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,460
implementation he deployed tested from

00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,590
the test over first whether it's okay or

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:36,310
not and then you go in and then after

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:39,520
that you give a week if any way you can

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:43,720
embed Google Analytics inside your

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,710
website and train track the you know the

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,810
pockets on the pages where the

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:53,680
behavioral flow to see whether your

00:27:49,810 --> 00:28:02,760
design really fit the course so that's

00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:06,070
how the goes right so that's the length

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:10,330
you need to analyze you having an

00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:13,630
analysis everything lies with the data

00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:15,420
six then only you can you know put down

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,170
that these are the project requirements

00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:21,840
and this is what you can do after that

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:25,090
drakensberg briefs for the project

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,220
please and please draw line because when

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,800
you work with a technical missions they

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:34,750
want to you know put as many

00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:38,100
functionalities as possible if can if

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,100
you can persuade them

00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,590
right negotiate requirement with petrol

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,630
kiss ability of the development just

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,600
negotiate with that if you can't do that

00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,390
or if you think that the features that

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,500
we request that are not beneficial or an

00:28:53,390 --> 00:29:01,360
opportunity to the goal just just see

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,360
you see the conditions they can you know

00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:05,169
you

00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:15,010
they can be perfectionist you know I

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,560
need this I need this I need this so you

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:22,570
need to counter them back with you know

00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:27,040
theories and you don't facts for

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:31,750
example they want they want the ball to

00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:35,620
be have this this and this you can if

00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:38,350
your judgments saying that the bottle

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,920
shouldn't be cluttered with those kind

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,910
of things

00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:46,180
you need to say to them otherwise the

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,990
you know they are the or they will in

00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:52,630
this creativity

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:55,000
thus designers we try to express

00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:58,390
ourselves through our products trying to

00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,260
be creative with our product but with

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,820
that with that in mind we have the 40

00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,020
plus month

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:14,149
guideline that we need to adhere so we

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:17,019
need to try to find little software yeah

00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:17,019
