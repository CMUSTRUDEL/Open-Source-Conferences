Description: 
	The new Gutenberg editor is a key part of WordPress 5.0 which is going to change the user experience of WordPress, for better or for worse. I will take a look at how Gutenberg has developed over its iterations as a plugin, examining how it works in terms of usefulness, desirability, usability, and findability, with a special focus on how accessible Gutenberg is for disabled users.
