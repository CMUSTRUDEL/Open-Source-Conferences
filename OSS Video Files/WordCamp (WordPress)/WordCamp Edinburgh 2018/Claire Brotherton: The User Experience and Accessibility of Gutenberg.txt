Title: Claire Brotherton: The User Experience and Accessibility of Gutenberg
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Edinburgh 2018
Description: 
	The new Gutenberg editor is a key part of WordPress 5.0 which is going to change the user experience of WordPress, for better or for worse. I will take a look at how Gutenberg has developed over its iterations as a plugin, examining how it works in terms of usefulness, desirability, usability, and findability, with a special focus on how accessible Gutenberg is for disabled users.

hi I'm pologize slightly bit as first

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:13,910
lady I've picked a PowerPoint template

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,990
and I don't have time to change the

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:22,550
images from the ecology theme so just

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:29,360
quick straw poll and who here has never

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:32,960
heard of Gutenberg before anyone 180 so

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:37,940
who has actually tried good mode okay so

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,720
so most of you so if if you don't know

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:44,680
what Gutenberg is it's the new WordPress

00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,899
editor let's come in in WordPress five

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,940
it's not got a release date yet for

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:53,600
wordpress.com it's going to be coming

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,059
into self hosted WordPress and the

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,680
editor is block based so at the moment

00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:59,989
with the current editor were used to

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,030
writing everything in one giant text box

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,980
but this new Gutenberg editor is

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,619
basically going to separate our content

00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,869
into blocks so we're going to have an

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:13,429
image block a paragraph block a heading

00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:15,770
block audio blog and so on Gutenberg was

00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:19,520
first released as a plug-in in June last

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:22,009
year it's currently got over 600,000

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,529
active installs I think more people have

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,529
actually installed it and brings the

00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:30,139
ones that are active at the moment and

00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:32,719
the classic editor will be turning into

00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:34,579
a plug-in it wouldn't be gone completely

00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,770
but when didn't Barry comes in that will

00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:41,749
become a new default WordPress post

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:44,270
editor the release date was going to be

00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:46,759
November 19th ie just up those where it

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,450
can that has now been shifted by eight

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,090
days on to 27th November but that's

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,219
still actually a busy period for people

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,749
because that's giving Tuesday right

00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:02,179
after Black Friday and Cyber Monday and

00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:04,939
one of the commentators on the WP weekly

00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:06,770
podcast just said there's no time in the

00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,410
holidays that's really good time for

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,530
code deployment so make of that what you

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,530
will

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:22,469
so how did we get here where didn't burg

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,599
well if we go back in January 2017 when

00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,310
the whole talk of creating a brand new

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,790
editor came out the wordpress design

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,969
team asked on their blog what makes a

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:38,040
great editor and they asked for feedback

00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:39,989
from various people on that so here are

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,480
some of the responses that we got from

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,069
what users wanted from a new year deter

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,780
so they were thinking about what does

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,450
the current editor do well what does he

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,730
not do well what would what kind of

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,189
improvements would we like to see

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,760
so some of the themes that come out in

00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:58,650
these comments are simplification some

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,200
people are saying current editor is too

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,980
complex I wanted to be simplified down

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,189
so it's easier for me to use another

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,159
issues discoverability so some things

00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:13,590
are basically hidden we and the current

00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,060
editor and people haven't used them just

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:20,489
because simply they didn't know that

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:22,949
they were there and then another person

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,379
has commented that we've had quite a

00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,629
large proliferation of WordPress page

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,510
builders because the editor as it stands

00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,629
is fairly basic and it can't build

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,440
complex layouts not without using custom

00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:39,060
code or using short codes or page

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,190
builder plugins which come into the

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,769
market to fill that need so somebody is

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,479
saying well you know maybe new editor

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,709
should be fulfilling part of that need

00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:52,109
and service using all these other

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:55,229
plugins and someone else has said well

00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:57,030
the user experience for the current

00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:58,590
editor is not good on mobile let's go

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,109
for a mobile first approach to get it

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,579
right on mobile and then other devices

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:08,689
and desktop will follow and only in this

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:11,819
discussion this idea blocks came out so

00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:14,909
people suggesting that different types

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,220
of blocks could be portrayed and styled

00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:22,530
differently on the page so it seems to

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:24,210
be a very flexible system a couple of

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,770
other comments they've picked out here

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,750
which I think are also quite pertinent

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:35,010
so the first one is from a guy called

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,530
Whaley who works a lot ending the third

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,290
sector they're a nonprofit sector and

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,680
he's basically highlighted the need for

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,560
near litter to be accessible it should

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,350
be portable and the job of the editor is

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,360
not designing he thinks it's

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,700
communicating so perhaps that's maybe a

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,040
kind of plea for something anti page

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,810
builder you know a lot of let's have it

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,090
you know build something really really

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:04,170
complex with lots of columns and things

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:08,730
you know it should be simple and someone

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:11,670
else saying it ha it has to be something

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,280
that covers a multitude of uses because

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,800
there is no one way that people use the

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,680
editor everybody goes in and does

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,490
different things with it so something as

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,580
we have to be mindful oh and I did a

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,850
very quick sort of Twitter poll just

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:32,010
over a year ago basically saying well

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,740
how do you add content WordPress do you

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,660
go straight in and start writing in the

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,640
editor or do you do something else do

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,710
you create your content first from some

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,630
other medium and then you go to the

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,300
editors finish it off polish it often

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,340
and publish it and I thought this was

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,000
quite interesting that the the results

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,890
here was split and I've put in the link

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,440
to the tweets and you can read through

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,970
the entire thread because people were

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,650
mentioning a variety of different tools

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,410
that we used they were talking about

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:05,220
things like Google Docs were notepad

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,050
grammar lay Evan all and saying well you

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,760
know it depends sometimes I'll go

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,380
straight to WordPress editor sometimes

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,270
I'll go somewhere else and create my

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,060
content in and I'll come back to

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,280
WordPress and finish it so part of this

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,750
work through I think has to have that

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,490
assumption in it that people are going

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,490
to add content from other sources

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:31,110
so just summarizing some of the problems

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,540
that we have with the existing editor so

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,360
if you look down at the bottom we've got

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,520
the screen options section and there's a

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,710
number of different options there and in

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,720
this screenshot taked all of them but

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,990
not everybody knows that this screen

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,080
options

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,789
chan is here and knows that these boxes

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,259
are here and taking all of them actually

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:56,319
opens up new options in the editor I've

00:06:53,259 --> 00:07:00,099
already mentioned short codes so short

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,319
codes being used sometimes to create

00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:04,720
layouts or other effects and WordPress

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,330
and they're they're taking the place of

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,370
rating actual PHP codes and Sue the

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,860
editor which would be regarded as unsafe

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,199
but they're not very pretty when you

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,889
look at them on the page and you look

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:21,280
back at your your posts and embed

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:23,110
discovery is an issue some people don't

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,479
realize that just simply pasting a

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,830
YouTube URL will embed that on the page

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:31,570
and then there are many other examples

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:33,729
and it's not necessarily true WYSIWYG

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,800
experience when you use the existing

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:38,590
editor because as many people have find

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,060
you can create something in the editor

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,220
and then when you actually publish it

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,349
and look at it on the site it doesn't

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:51,340
look quite the same as the way you

00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:54,280
creating them so this is the stated aim

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,550
of Guttenberg from the github repository

00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:02,409
where it's being created so we've got

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:05,469
three three elements I think to this so

00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:07,180
one of them is we want to create a

00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:08,919
builder so we're going to create

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,979
something that makes rich posts

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:16,000
effortless so that also incorporates

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:18,759
something that is easy to use and I

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,080
think there's a discoverability element

00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:27,219
to this as well so where people are

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,659
using things that they or they don't

00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:30,639
know how to use things that they don't

00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:34,959
know how to use then Gutenberg wants to

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:38,229
make that more transparent and another

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,120
aim of the whole project is to when user

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,310
is another market so people who've got

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,680
used to the likes of Squarespace or

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:52,120
medium or Wix to try and get some of

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:54,850
that user base come to WordPress so I

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,430
kind of stole this a little bit I was at

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,680
accessibility Scotland a week ago

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,080
and one of these figures they're

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,580
mentioned these UX principles I thought

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,200
would be quite useful to go through them

00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,460
these are from a guy called Peter

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,190
morville so these are seven principles

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:16,290
of UX that should be incorporated into

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:19,959
when you do any kind of software design

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,360
so first point they're being useful will

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,220
that is absolutely not in question an

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,810
editor is absolutely integral and

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,810
essential to WordPress we can't get away

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:31,330
from that we want we also want to need

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,990
it to be usable we need people to use it

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,860
the way that is intended to be used and

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:40,930
it should be something that people

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:44,830
actually want to use desirable then we

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,570
need to have people find what they need

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:50,110
to use in the UI they have to be able to

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:52,690
complete their objective somehow

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,170
accessibility is also a really important

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,440
value so about 20% of the population of

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,750
some kind of disability and absolutely

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,589
Guttenberg should be accessible to all

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:08,110
of those people credibility the editor

00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:12,480
has to have people having trust and

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:15,520
faith in it and finally valuable so

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,160
there is a lot of excitement about the

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,140
potential of Gutenberg it should open up

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,600
the WordPress project in some regards it

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:30,700
should open up the possibility to create

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:33,040
custom blocks for example so what do

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:37,540
users think of Gutenberg so far so it's

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:44,920
been out as a plugin for about a year

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:46,930
and four months so I was going to say

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,520
more about these but I'm just going to

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,440
put the links in so you can go off and

00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,410
explore for yourself but a few people

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,920
have done some user testing of Gutenberg

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,959
and David Besser efficiently posted best

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,660
poster boats and his experience of high

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,279
school students using gutenberg and they

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,380
think to get on pretty well with it they

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,130
seem to take to it really well and had

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:12,199
no major major issues ten up of them a

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,850
couple of different user tests

00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:17,189
they've done one in June and they did

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,920
one in November and they found that the

00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:22,290
system usability scale that be tested on

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,189
that the values had increased in that

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:29,579
time but these are all very small scale

00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:32,459
studies the first study there only had

00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:36,449
40 participants the second one had ten

00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:38,970
and the third had five and also well in

00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:41,879
the first one most of them were not

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:47,699
familiar with WordPress but in the other

00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:51,449
two they definitely were so the biggest

00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:56,100
amount user testing we've had is from

00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:59,100
wordpress.org people leaving reviews and

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,930
we've got now this was taken on web and

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,269
steam the screenshot we've got over

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,550
1,000 favourite users are Reid Gooden

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:09,480
Burak and as you can see is a pretty

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:11,610
high proportion of one-star use it's

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,500
actually really split there's there's a

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,839
reasonable number of five-star reviews

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,819
there's a lot one-star there's not too

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,329
many people that are somewhere in the

00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:23,610
middle but do you have to take this

00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:25,709
maybe with a pinch of salt because these

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,870
are all time reveals these have not been

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,639
separated by version and people who

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,589
tried very very early ration of

00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,930
Gutenberg and got negative impression

00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:35,550
then that's not representative of where

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:41,790
the projects know because it's been

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:45,500
through so much development since but

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:48,809
having said that this is a quote from

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,910
actually a really good post I just found

00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,860
the other day by Eric Dantzler of image

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,350
Lee he makes their next-gen gallery

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,500
plugin huge huge plugin over a million

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,740
downloads and he said he lowed to the

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,660
average for the good bird reviews and it

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,879
does fall in line with what he stated

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,370
and her star reviews

00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:11,100
he says it's clearly the plug-in is not

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,920
worrying potential users and he is one

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,649
of a few while they've been playing a

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,110
number of voices high profile voices

00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:20,730
who've been saying actually maybe we

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,870
should delay the release you know that

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,930
still not got all the bugs and issues I

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,540
don't you know maybe maybe waiting a bit

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,120
longer and sorting that is the right

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,550
thing to do so other people have been

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,130
saying the same include use Duvall Coast

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:42,830
and Mark Wiley who I mentioned before

00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:47,240
I'm Martin Rand Hendrickson so it just

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:50,360
got a couple of sample and reviews here

00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,770
this is one five-star review so this is

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:58,460
one person saying great easy-to-use love

00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:01,310
the block system treats attractive blog

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:06,440
posts so they they've got a good

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:07,660
impression clearly this one is the

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,420
opposite

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,690
none of the editors they've used was as

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,500
instructed to the rating process

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:20,060
absolute worst editing experience ever

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,480
salt a problem that didn't exist created

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:26,360
a different problem that didn't exist so

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,130
this is someone who's had a bad first

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,590
impression will he go back to using

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:35,420
Guttenberg don't know so some of the

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,120
other criticisms and concerns with

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,960
Guttenberg earth I've listed here a big

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,690
one is backwards compatibility so there

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,880
is a sense of worry that once five comes

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,410
in and getting broke comes in are all

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
existing States going to break and

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,700
obviously plugin in theme developers

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,010
have done a lot of work to avoid that

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,190
happening but getting very completely

00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:00,980
changes the the metabolic system that

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,590
the current editor has and it all has to

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,460
be rebuilt in the Gutenberg way and

00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:09,410
we'll just you know we know that the

00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,570
work has progressed on this but we don't

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:17,180
know 100% we can't say with certainty

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:18,830
that everything will work another point

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,470
I suppose the last one just want to say

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,210
briefly on that one if you are a

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,370
developer and you think great I want to

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:28,250
make my own Guttenberg block then that's

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,950
good and please try but the barrister

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:35,810
entry is actually quite high I read a

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,430
comment on WP Tyrone Post where somebody

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,560
was saying

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,200
to learn everything that they needed to

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,180
learn because Gutenberg is heavily based

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,370
on react to JavaScript library wasn't

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,160
just learning JavaScript it was learning

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:51,460
a lot of other things and he said I

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:56,470
think it takes about 450 hours plus per

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:58,620
developer to do this so what about

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:02,740
accessibility

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:06,970
well back in 2016 WordPress made a

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,920
commitment to release all new updated

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,710
code that goes into WordPress core and

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,030
bundle teams must conform with the

00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,650
wicked 2.0 guidelines and level EE and

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:20,140
I'm not going to go into depth about

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:23,190
what the two guidelines are there it's a

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:26,260
long document but basically they cover

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,600
the major categories of disabilities

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:32,500
which are visual motor or the training

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,330
cognitive and this is basically a

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,030
requirement this is not a nice to have

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,850
we have to remember that WordPress post

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,500
32% of the web and then of 20% of them

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,510
have a disability it is not an

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,860
insignificant number of people just

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,800
going to skip over this very very

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,840
quickly I've got three posts on my blog

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,570
so don't copy the links down the slides

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,400
will be available later you can see from

00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,500
these different experiences their

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,910
parents worth testing Guttenberg and

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,830
what's changed in that time so some of

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,220
the things that I've noticed have

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:12,839
improved are if you look on the left

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:18,220
we've got a couple of earlier prototypes

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:20,770
so I'm they the block selector it was

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,740
not possible to use the keyboard only a

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,320
lot of people use with disabilities can

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,270
only use the keyboard to people with

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,820
motor disabilities or people of visual

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,950
impairments and it wasn't possible to

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,450
navigate beyond the blocks that you saw

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,590
there so there were a lot of unavailable

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:40,600
things and the calendar widget has also

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,520
been substantially changed because at

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,760
the time that I tested it I was noticing

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,470
and the black line is where the focus is

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,180
on the page and it was actually behind

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,779
that widget it wasn't possible to

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,469
actually

00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:55,690
pick a date on that that calendar widget

00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:58,389
but fortunately that's all being correct

00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,489
amount it's it's much better we've also

00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:02,649
got a lot of keyboard shortcuts will

00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:04,450
come in from the classic editor and new

00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:06,879
ones have been invented

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,279
we've got improved focus management's

00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:12,729
you couldn't publish a post initially

00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:17,109
now you can do that and the search for a

00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:21,419
box there's a lot better but we still

00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:23,259
have some items causing some friction so

00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,570
even though we've got the keyboard

00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:28,469
shortcuts it still needs a lot of

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,479
keystrokes to create and polish a post

00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:34,179
we've got different kind of toolbars per

00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:36,099
block so we've got paragraph toolbar at

00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,589
the top there we've got heading one and

00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:40,839
we've got an image one here and they all

00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:43,330
look slightly different so it can be a

00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,309
little bit jarring maybe going from one

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,669
to another to another and not seeing the

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,710
same familiar icons then we've got this

00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,539
three doc menu and that's got another

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,359
whole set of options in there including

00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:57,399
the remove block one which is certainly

00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,919
something that people are going to want

00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:06,849
to be able to do and maybe that should

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:08,739
not be hidden away so what's been going

00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:12,849
on recently with Gutenberg and

00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:15,369
accessibility well we had a blow-up a

00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:18,999
number of weeks ago when we on Rietveld

00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:21,099
left the accessibility team and she

00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:24,519
published this blog post on why and

00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:28,059
there were a number of reasons but some

00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:30,190
of the main ones were that one big

00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,049
problem was that the people in the

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,169
accessibility team who were all

00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:37,809
volunteers no accessibility well but

00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:39,969
they did not know reacts well which is

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:42,399
what Gutenberg is built with so they

00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:44,440
were putting out and bug reports and

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:46,839
issues that were simply not getting

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,690
fixed and then sometimes when they were

00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:51,239
fixed then in the next iteration of

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,830
Guttenberg they would actually introduce

00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:58,019
inaccessible code back again which was

00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:01,179
obviously not good and again the

00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:03,840
keyboard testing for new components are

00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:10,510
introduced into the editor not enough

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:13,060
before that happened and in vans

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:16,510
resignation post she mentioned this

00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:19,960
quote from Andrea Freccia who's also on

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:25,770
the accessibility team and I put the

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:28,750
highlights in here he has basically said

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:32,500
what they found is the user experience

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,390
is very complicated and that for people

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,590
where accessibility needs the new editor

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:41,560
is very usable he says and one big big

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,120
problem with this is accessibility has

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,860
not been incorporated in the design

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,980
process and if you do know anything

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,270
about accessibility you know that it's

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,650
something that should always be thought

00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,710
about from the beginning because

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:56,140
thinking about it at a later stage means

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,450
basically remediating things which is a

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,900
lot harder to do than simply building it

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:05,200
the right way in the first place

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,300
and finally Gutenberg is described as a

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,500
regression in terms of accessibility

00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:15,060
level compared to the previous editor

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,060
and I think that's very telling

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,480
so after this a few weeks later and

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,990
we've got this post on the accessibility

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,550
status of Gutenberg and I'm gonna put

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,220
the link in so that you can go off and

00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:33,040
read this and fool for yourself I'm a

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:37,290
part of the team we have a weekly

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,290
meeting on afraid the afternoon on slap

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:44,260
so here is an example of a couple of the

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:49,840
things that we highlighted in the post

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:52,060
so cognitive load this is me using the

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,380
mouse submissively to scroll through the

00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,480
posts but you can see there's a lot

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,940
going on that there's things popping up

00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,740
we've got different toolbars if I click

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,640
on different things the sidebar is

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:07,540
changing you know this is perhaps a lot

00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,940
for some people to take in and then

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,860
maybe what you'd call inconsistency in

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,930
your eyes have gone back to different

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:17,510
toolbars doing different things and the

00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:19,549
classic editors we know where and the

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,919
the buttons basically stay in the one

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:24,020
place and it's the same once people know

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:35,419
where they are with that Guttenberg is

00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:37,130
definitely a step away from that another

00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:39,160
of the concerns that they Tim

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,200
highlighted are accessibility

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,650
antipatterns so here we've got an

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,230
example basically when you type in the

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:51,260
editor it's like one giant forum and a

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,750
good accessible practice would be every

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,130
minute goes on a forum to label it but

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,710
we don't have that here we've got

00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,809
placeholders we've got the add title one

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,700
and we've got another one underneath now

00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,400
when we have the cursor in our title

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,780
that's fine we can still seem that we

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,850
have to add the title there but will we

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,980
put the cursor below

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:12,280
we immediately lose the message and then

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,010
you know if we haven't been

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:22,370
concentrating then what we might get

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:24,620
started what do we actually do here and

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:28,309
this is another one about and

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:30,440
iconography so there's a recommend you

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:33,110
check that this post the best icon is a

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,700
text label it's got some good and

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:42,410
actually amusing examples of how putting

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:45,200
in icons can work or not work for you

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:47,570
but here I've got an example this is the

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,429
top bar of the editor and going through

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,260
the various parts and some of these

00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,299
things are fairly obvious what they do

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,160
because the tracks and their preview

00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,500
publish we understand what those vary

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,200
but then when when we go back to some of

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,270
the other things okay that's a blog that

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,220
I'm doing reading we've probably seen

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,980
but what's content structure what's blog

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,090
navigation and then some of the other

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,850
ones that the other end

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,520
settings what does that do to more tools

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:19,040
and options again what does that do it's

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,900
not obvious so yes we've got the

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,179
keyboard shortcuts in know and this is

00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:26,710
very good we've got a long list of them

00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,710
and we've got them for Windows and Mac

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:32,600
one issue that we've got here is

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,600
with keyboard shortcuts it's good if

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,370
users can actually choose the room and

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,050
that's not possible currently with

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,870
Gutenberg they can't move map them to

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,620
the the keyboard strokes that they would

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,500
like to use

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:49,190
we've also has a few cases of where

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:51,710
their shortcuts been changed that I know

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,780
that the ones who delete a block was

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,559
changed recently because someone found

00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:05,510
that that was the keystroke actually

00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:07,010
restarts Linux so I this one I'm not

00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,520
going to go through everything this is

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:15,559
quite long I did like a little demo of

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:17,750
me writing a new post and it's this is

00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,400
actually like a five-minute long swim

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,420
cap so I don't have time to go through

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:26,600
it all but you can see where the green

00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:28,309
line is there that's a chrome add-on

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,260
that I put on which is basically showing

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:33,050
you where to focus on the page a few is

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,990
if you were using the keyboard only

00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:38,450
you're basically using the tab key

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:40,670
mainly on the Shift + tab to go backward

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,280
and forward to the various interactive

00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,830
elements so you can see as I'm going

00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,900
through here just how much keystrokes

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,809
there are aside from actually typing in

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,240
the content and yes we have got the

00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:55,850
shortcuts no to move between different

00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:08,300
parts of the editor but it's still

00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:09,830
unlocked a lot of keystrokes so at the

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,580
end of the accessibility team to

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,929
statement they basically fund up and

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,880
they have they have noted that the

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:19,100
progress that Gutenberg as me because

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,530
I'm a lot of work is being done and

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,170
don't don't forget this that the team is

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,809
committed to making this as accessible

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,200
as possible and is a core value of

00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:32,330
WordPress that it should be accessible

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,910
but they're saying we believe it's less

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,280
accessible than the existing editor

00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,500
although there are some accessibility

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,070
features that the classic editor doesn't

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,789
offer that Gutenberg does for the final

00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,919
segment is but

00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:48,289
basically saying we can't recommend

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,769
Guttenberg in its current state for

00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:54,320
anyone who has to use assistive

00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:56,869
technology so the current thinking is

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,259
when version 5 ships there's going to be

00:26:56,869 --> 00:27:02,899
a message in the admin saying do you use

00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:04,789
excessive assistive technology well if

00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:06,769
you do maybe you should be looking at

00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,960
carrying on with a classic editor

00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:17,659
Gutenberg might not be there yet for you

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:22,399
I so going back to our UX diagram who

00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:26,029
does getting bearing measure up well we

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,639
know that 600,000 people horse it we

00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:31,580
know the 600,000 installs of Gutenberg

00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:34,580
but there are also 500,000 or the

00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,889
classic editor plugin now does that mean

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,299
that people are testing both or does it

00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:40,249
mean that they've been still classic

00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:43,489
editor because they don't like Gutenberg

00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:46,820
we don't know in terms of usability

00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:48,379
we've seen mixed reactions there some

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,149
people find the new interface very

00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:54,859
intuitive and some people find it very

00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:58,070
unintuitive and again in terms of

00:27:54,859 --> 00:28:00,340
desirability very polarizing reactions

00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:03,169
some people love Gutenberg some people

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:06,679
really hate it and there's not too many

00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:08,269
in the middle whether things are

00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,669
findable that's an interesting one

00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,289
because discoverability was one of the

00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:14,629
goals for the new editor but it

00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:16,729
ironically it seems that people are

00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:19,789
still saying but a lot of things are

00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:22,489
hidden away I know that they've just

00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:25,039
changed for example people are saying oh

00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:28,279
I couldn't edit a permalink in Gutenberg

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,929
and it does come up once you put the

00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:32,720
title and it comes up above but people

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:35,330
weren't finding that so in the next

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,759
iteration there's going to be a section

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:43,249
in the sidebar as well for that

00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:45,649
accessibility that definitely the

00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:48,679
commitments there but it's not ready yet

00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:50,599
and one of the key issues from that was

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,019
that he just wasn't far to them from the

00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,019
beginning

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,340
credibility well we can see some people

00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,080
left the the bad reviews you know

00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,640
they've they've tried it they don't like

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,760
it they've been turned off by Guttenberg

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:08,060
already got to come back to it again

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:11,570
they might or they might not and in

00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:13,130
terms of how valuable it is well plug in

00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,640
a theme developers have done a lot of

00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:19,460
preparation but we have to wait and see

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,830
what happens with the final release but

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,080
you know there could be some really good

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:30,770
and progressive stuff coming out in this

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:33,410
area so if you want to help to make good

00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:35,770
and very best what can you do well you

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:38,630
can try the plugin as it is just now or

00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:41,300
you can also download WordPress five is

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:44,150
a beta version it's so constantly being

00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:48,140
updated I think we're on beat five just

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,460
know and you can add a response there's
