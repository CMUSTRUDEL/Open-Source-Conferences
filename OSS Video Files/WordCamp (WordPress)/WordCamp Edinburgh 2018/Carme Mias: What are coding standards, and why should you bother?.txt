Title: Carme Mias: What are coding standards, and why should you bother?
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Edinburgh 2018
Description: 
	If you are a freelancer, adopting Coding Standards for the first time is a bit like taking up exercise: you know it’d do you good, but there’s always some urgent deadline or something else more important to do. After all, your code works, right? So, why bother?
In this talk, I will tell you why it matters, explain my experience of the process, including the ups and downs, and share a few tricks I have learned on the way that will make your work better and your life easier.

my name is karma I'm a freelance web

00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:15,840
developer and today I'll talk about

00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:18,759
coding standards and why god or c1

00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:24,369
before I start all my to our skills is

00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:26,560
any real answers quite a few that are

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:32,340
you using colleague standards at all at

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,340
the moment for their own projects and

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:42,480
everybody else is not feel I'm still

00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:47,200
using coding standards the teamwork caps

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,390
okay well basically uh that was my

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,020
understanding of coding standards

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,989
basically they're useful for teamwork

00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:36,130
specially but not so much if you're

00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:39,100
working so we witness for each time you

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:43,810
say how to add them to your workflow and

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:49,000
what we gain by using so as I said I'm

00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:51,340
self-employed we all know that but also

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,240
there's a lot of things that you need to

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,460
feel it for today and sometimes even

00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,619
that feeling like is you've got to climb

00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:05,890
work you have to keep up with new

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:10,929
technology you need to find out for

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:14,169
networking for community and basically

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,550
at the end you end up having to

00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:21,670
prioritize

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:32,650
and that is what I have done I knew Cody

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:35,170
studies away but there are always until

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:39,250
one day I decided to look into there any

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:42,400
more detail and I found out that my

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,400
assumption of coding standards mainly

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,810
useful only for teams was actually not

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,990
right and here I just want to tell you

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,210
what I found out so please start from

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,460
the beginning code each time before what

00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,640
I think it's not that easy to find a

00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,610
definition online and the best I could

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,160
find is this from Wikipedia it don't try

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,970
to relive some to my stacks after

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,070
highlight the key words so coding

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:18,520
standards are basically conventions and

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:21,370
guidelines to quality by including the

00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,540
readability and therefore also making a

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,120
moment in and that is done with

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,480
recommendations while indentation

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,810
whitespace naming conventions but also

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:38,290
adding comments to make to document

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:43,800
record we see in the code itself and

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,120
recommend being best practices okay

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,030
[Music]

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,709
many companies is coding standards and

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,620
platforms so these are just some

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:59,410
examples they have published them online

00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:02,200
and you can find them easily but because

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,880
I work mostly with WordPress then I just

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,900
decide to go with the WordPress codex

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:12,160
time that's really would be the word is

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:17,350
called a standard say you can find all

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:22,450
the details in the developer book or on

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,460
github basically make over widgets that

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,289
WordPress

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:32,310
this HP is our credo cells yes and

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:34,349
accessibility is there are no

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:40,800
incorporated into the coding standards

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:45,120
but recommended by phones I'll give you

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,000
some examples of each general guidelines

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,310
for example here examples of how to use

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:59,090
annotation so we start mine and spaces

00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:03,150
for alignment in the middle I know the

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:05,580
example we need our space it out so

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:10,190
basically hide spaces nearly any way on

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:12,900
either side of brackets either side

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,000
Haitian conditionals equals etcetera

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,490
exactly there are exceptions I'm not

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,400
gonna go into that just you can find it

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:25,229
online all the other conditions are

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:28,320
quite fun and basically they conclude

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:30,990
the conditions because you write it the

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,889
opposite way that you would say so you

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:39,990
would say if the variable equals 5 then

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:46,380
do that but we Luna P put the value

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:49,919
first and and that is to avoid if you

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,979
type in quickly and you missing an equal

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,840
to equals in this case you may end up

00:05:52,979 --> 00:06:02,699
changing the value of the variable by

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:06,150
mistake so it's just a best friend go to

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,639
PHP code nice financing so many

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,320
conventions is an example so use

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,919
underscores for variables and functions

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:18,389
and use dashes for file names and

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,860
important one is sanitation and

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:26,099
validation so every input from the front

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,280
end needs to be validated before being

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:31,490
stored in the database and here Romilly

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,490
that

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,110
pendejo active in between these are just

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,240
some examples just checking if the value

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:45,280
is an integer removing any HTML that

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,530
shouldn't be there and just checking

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,880
that the value is an email and meaning

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,980
any characters that shouldn't be there

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,400
these are examples you can find these

00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:01,140
are all huge amount of functions and you

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,390
can find them on the code in the codex

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,840
JavaScript Java screen again many

00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:10,480
conventions so instead of underscores we

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,590
use camel case for variables and

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,800
functions constructive best practices

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:23,440
all the variables you neglected the

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:26,080
school use 3 equals the set of to use

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,050
curly brackets this sounds a bit

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,600
old-fashioned but that's water WordPress

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:37,390
coding standard say there's a lot more

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,330
HTML and CSS there's not a lot for work

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:44,040
for them but it's basically it is common

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:47,800
sense you start for indentation to show

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,530
hierarchy and everything lowercase and

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:55,690
this is as just paste a properties line

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:59,370
and the same elements accessibility as I

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:03,040
said they're going the coding standards

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:07,020
they're just guidelines are closely for

00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:11,380
the comfort such the bottom user 90 HTML

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,930
follow the heavy hierarchy and then skip

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:19,120
to content links and instantly the text

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:24,510
for when you have links that are only an

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:28,500
image so these are just a small sample

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:32,090
this seems to be a huge amount remember

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,289
but this there's no need to remember

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:39,890
this because there are tools are helpful

00:08:35,289 --> 00:09:04,970
and we're going to look at some of them

00:08:39,890 --> 00:09:17,180
in action so here I've got three sample

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:22,010
files one PHP ones ears and and one new

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:32,510
style sheet and I've got some errors in

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:38,510
them I just want to show you what comes

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:41,660
up okay first of all we look at the PHP

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:49,670
file this is just taken from the Codex

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:57,320
is just a function now is copy and paste

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:59,920
it from the Codex and it works but when

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:12,740
we put it through the coding standards

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:17,270
check so we call this PHP code inside be

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,400
comes up with ten errors okay so this is

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,930
what you get so here you have the line

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:27,160
number then it tells you what is wrong

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:30,440
and there's so much never have applause

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,020
if you see here's a six marks any

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,389
violations can be fix of monitoring

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:40,209
these are the ones that can be quickly

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:42,129
what type of air is really hot if you

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,559
see the white second increase

00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:48,639
automatically article with invitation

00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:54,639
and spacing then we put all the things

00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:56,889
we learn by version not said in these

00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,069
means new versions that will not always

00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:02,259
be loaded you just browser caching so

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:06,069
it's quite useful because it gives you

00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:09,850
and an idea of what you could change to

00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:13,870
make it better so the code works but if

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:20,170
we look at near the function that's in

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:24,370
line 13 is this myth here and here style

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:27,759
so we have what if the father will be

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:31,629
doing here a little has the version ok

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:37,329
and that means if there was a new

00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:40,569
version of parent theme it wouldn't

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:43,929
really load it into the cache when we

00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:47,920
are we may not want that to happen but

00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:49,120
at least we know our weather to

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,800
something better

00:11:49,120 --> 00:12:07,389
ok if we wanted to fix it there is

00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:09,819
another command called cold ok basically

00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:11,980
which started you want to use which

00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:14,949
valuable to fix and if you don't want

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,860
the file to be overwritten you like this

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:19,230
option here that will create another

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:28,269
file

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:30,730
ok so six arrows were fixed ok if we

00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:41,660
look at it we will see that is basically

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:45,780
no limitation on this place now the jas

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:48,900
yes while of course this file here

00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,640
associated from one of these sample

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,390
including questions and I've added some

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,780
extra errors here just a bit of code and

00:12:54,390 --> 00:13:01,860
it doesn't do anything the file works is

00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:05,100
when I see errors I don't mean others

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,260
that will create the file but everything

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,380
lately to coding standard so here you

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:13,950
see that the file actually works it's

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:20,820
not a breaking and it's a coda standard

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:28,710
there if we look at what the code inside

00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:45,270
to say about these files 25 errors Wow

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:45,900
I look at them spaces it says here 22

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,350
errors

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:54,870
fixable why it doesn't actually tell us

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:59,490
which ones the PHP which means told us

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:04,320
which one this one person okay so if we

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:10,130
wanted to find out exactly which else

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,130
would be see exclude equal to a dry run

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,070
so basically we'll run the same command

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,740
option and these are the ones that

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,470
couldn't be fake so that means

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,440
everything else and yet the mighty

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,810
clinics if we wanted to be more happy we

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:37,200
think that we would do the proper right

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:43,260
without just a touch that fixed okay all

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:50,920
right and now for stuff CSS for star CSS

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:53,800
we've already seen file

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:58,990
everything in one line so that women

00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:09,610
give us also Marisa and the command to

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:14,800
check that is this one styling again I

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:17,170
like to sleep on it gives us the file

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,590
number and it gives the description of

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,540
the era

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:23,260
this one doesn't actually even give an

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:26,470
account of errors or if is any which can

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:36,570
be automatically fixed so we would have

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:39,490
to just go for it with this command okay

00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:46,450
so basically fixed everything except one

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:48,400
and if we look at it now basically the

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:54,990
only thing that didn't fix is separate

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,990
these two in two separate ones okay so

00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,580
so that's it for the command line if

00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,950
obviously this is not very useful if you

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,870
write in code from scratch this will

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:08,290
only be useful if you have something

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:13,210
that you want to do already written or

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:16,510
it's like so in in the case of if you're

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:21,060
writing code from scratch then you will

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,060
need to add these tools to the editor

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:29,410
our code

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:35,110
oops I use Adam but the same will exist

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:36,760
for whichever the editor you use here we

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:41,560
can see what it looks like

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:44,860
every line the president will have if we

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:49,450
hover our mouse on it it will give us

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:53,110
this is the genius a message explaining

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,860
what it is and this is very useful it

00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:00,010
just six one at the time by taking six

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,589
button or if you want to find out more

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:08,500
about you

00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:08,500
click on this link here and open it

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:27,949
means you an explanation all for

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:35,840
deliveries for it ok so this is this is

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:41,539
quite useful is and it's for EAS here

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:45,200
the PHP also gives as the doors and

00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:48,950
interest and the finisher of the air but

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:56,450
it doesn't have the fix option and it

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:59,860
doesn't have the link so the PHP had

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:03,769
some advantages from the console that is

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:09,529
enhanced and when we come to the editor

00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:12,169
is the other way and the style is again

00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:16,549
remember that we fix this but if you

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:19,909
whatever these are self initial

00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:22,789
explanation for the address and then

00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:27,649
there is no fixed pattern but there is a

00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:30,470
link here what you see that a link that

00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:36,710
will give us more information about

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:38,960
designer ok so and here at the bottom as

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:43,059
well there's more explanations about the

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:52,360
line number and all of that so basically

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:52,360
the the tools that you glue off

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,100
absolutely in that collection

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:29,390
don't worry okay so if you wanted to

00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:32,240
install all of those things for the

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:34,160
console you'll find instructions so

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,660
these are pieces without few studies

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:42,410
because me for es willing styling and

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:44,510
instructions it is quite a while so I'm

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:48,470
flipping them on a blog post that you

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:52,180
can find online um if you want to add

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:57,290
them to your editors with call you can

00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:59,990
use you can set the configuration for

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,970
your editor and then then install some

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,740
of these packages these are the ones

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,940
initial for I don't do the equivalent

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:10,220
ones for for your editor this one I

00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,440
haven't demonstrated is who I'll help

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,820
you comments add comments to the

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,280
functions and the files and then your

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,410
instructions there's a really good blog

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,860
by gábor basically Scott will slowly

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:27,190
come in super handy video for all the

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,880
elements you find them in the geek

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:34,790
coalition asleep waking right so and

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,020
obviously after this the next logical

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:41,800
step will provide them to me

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:47,300
task runners or continuous integration

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:50,500
but that would be in in the meantime you

00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:55,310
can start using what are showing him and

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:58,070
you will green and what basically what

00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,950
I've found is this is Mike having an

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,020
out-of-the-box cold reading he's just

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:06,559
happy is having a national happy

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:11,179
this is okay but you could do better by

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:13,100
doing this and by what I found is that

00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:15,679
by using the coding standards have

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:20,260
become more conscious of what I write

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:24,890
and I it's making my color better and

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:32,780
hopefully will help me get into more

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:37,490
interesting projects and also it will

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:40,850
help become teacher please what do I

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,580
mean by future-proof I don't know if

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:53,440
you've heard those type is this new team

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:57,140
for the WordPress that make workers and

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,420
basically what they do is the the

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,510
objective is to check every single

00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:05,830
flooding and theme in the repository

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:10,730
against the coding standards that means

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:12,530
that here's an example at the moment

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,260
they just give you if it's compatible

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,530
with your current version of PHP right

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:21,530
they also give a score against how that

00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:24,190
for that the quality of the code for

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:29,420
that plug-in so if you're thinking of

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:31,940
perhaps on a publishing theme or the

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,309
repository and this would be quite

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:38,900
useful if you're already using your

00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:41,559
WordPress coding standards and that's it

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,559
that's all I've got

00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,080
[Music]

00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:04,570
I'm doing that through construction

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:07,880
ladies flaky Wi-Fi so since my comment

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,520
he mentioned the best HP coding

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,260
standards under several of us out that

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,850
is there any in particularly you think

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:26,450
that would be that you would recommend

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:29,570
it would be interesting example I know

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,370
it's having there's a PHP coding step

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,260
yes no alternative is a handful of

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,700
others in the way that's why I'm not

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,340
sure what the difference is between the

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,500
ones that other people have builder

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,789
including standards yes I know you can

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,860
adapt them I just installed the default

00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:49,010
I think the default WordPress includes

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:57,140
the VAP and the core WordPress core

00:23:49,010 --> 00:24:01,070
standards altogether from there I know

00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:03,169
there's some other ones yes yes I chose

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:08,409
you I just use the general one and I

00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:08,409
think the general one includes I think

00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:25,220
any questions luck question so since you

00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:29,200
stole this yes yes but what I'm doing as

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,200
well when I have done is go see my

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,330
second question is that do you know of

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,580
any way in which you can stop it showing

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:50,000
well-read Ballas until you are ready to

00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:53,330
so say you can use the comments you can

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,480
add the fee for the PHP these common are

00:24:53,330 --> 00:25:00,810
the togas speech pcs disabled at the top

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,840
and then enable at the end and oh just

00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:12,510
he's not going to read the file and then

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:14,880
when you ready to that you can also have

00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,700
it just dupe run it whenever you're safe

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,850
so does it show the Redbirds it just

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,020
fixes your errors when I don't say and

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:35,720
question is the true that you run the

00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:46,470
WordPress meetup in classical yes I

00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:53,670
don't know STUV my clients are quite

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:56,760
small so that's partly part of the idea

00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:01,880
that if I get better and things like

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,880
this then I can take on bigger projects

00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,880
you mention is using and continuous

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,290
integration events and things like

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,560
Travis with these do you have any

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:16,890
examples or resources of how I might if

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:30,840
I was going to do those maybe a next

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:37,130
book thank you

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,130
