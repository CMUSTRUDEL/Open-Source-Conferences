	00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:09,969
my name's Kayla and I work for 34 SP

00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:11,740
comm we're a hosting company based in

00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:14,889
Manchester I'm used to fighting up for

00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:19,869
that I point down first Scotland so yeah

00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:22,720
I'm part of my job is speaking to

00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:25,900
customers about WordPress websites and

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,770
as a hosting company we get people

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:34,239
calling us and one insult their websites

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:36,370
and they usually ask us um if it's new

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,609
customer they usually ask how do we get

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:44,710
started what would you recommend and we

00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:47,079
usually recommend WordPress and when

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,239
people when we get people set up with

00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,249
WordPress the first time they log in to

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,999
the dashboard sometimes they can look at

00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:58,359
it and just be a bit overwhelmed and

00:00:53,999 --> 00:01:00,609
happens quite often but part of my job

00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,519
is reassuring them walking them through

00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,049
the WordPress dashboard and hopefully

00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,510
getting them to stick with it long

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,300
enough so that they see they is awesome

00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:13,510
and that it's not quite as daunting as

00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,040
it appears to me and is anyone here

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,860
making that first website is anyone

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,720
completely new to WordPress I've got a

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,750
couple of people cool well hopefully

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,390
you'll come away from this with some

00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,820
some new knowledge and be a bit more

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,730
confident when you're using WordPress

00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,280
and because this is a workshop instead

00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,130
of just a talk because I usually give

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,620
this as a talk I'm gonna be taking

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,600
little pauses between sections to maybe

00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,090
take some questions come down help

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,730
people if people need specific help

00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,370
we'll just kind of try and make it a bit

00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:51,090
more interactive and yeah see what we

00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:58,870
can do to help people get started

00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:00,070
um slides are a bit weird oh there we go

00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,220
that's because I'm scrolling the wrong

00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,580
way there we go cool so one of the

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,759
reasons we out so if RSP we recommend

00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,920
WordPress to new people and we recommend

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,349
it usually before we recommend any kind

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,170
of drag-and-drop style editor and the

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,220
main reasons we do that is because

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,310
WordPress is completely open

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,350
if you have a wordpress website it's

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,480
your own website you've got access to

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,590
all the files all the code you can do

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,870
whatever you want with it you can take

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,460
it wherever you want whereas sometimes

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,190
with the drag-and-drop style

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,860
editors or if you're using a service

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,290
that provides one of them your and some

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,450
of the time you're quite stuck in that

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,500
location and you've got less freedom to

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,170
do what you want with it

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,330
so for some people the drag-and-drop

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,240
style thing is very much what they would

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,550
like and that's fine but for new people

00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,900
we try to get them on WordPress because

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:58,990
when when they've got used to it and set

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,130
off and using it quite regular they can

00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,500
do whatever they want with it and

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:07,870
they've got more freedom overall and

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:11,500
that's great WordPress can also do

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,110
anything so any kind of website you can

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,630
imagine you can almost guarantee there

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,730
will already be a plug-in that does what

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,860
you want your website to do so if you

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,930
want to run a shop you can install the

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,760
WooCommerce plug-in and set that up if

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,130
you want a forum there's a plug-in for

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,930
that a social media any web site you can

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,670
think of there's probably a plugin that

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,630
will help you achieve your outcome

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,520
already and yeah that's really good so

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,270
you can do pretty much anything with

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,970
WordPress so what I'm going to do today

00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:47,140
is I've set up a little test website

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,120
completely out of the box so it's your

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,910
website as you would first log into it

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,470
today and we're gonna I'm going to go

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,250
through the dashboard with you maybe

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,450
configure a few popular plugins and

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,550
we've got to have a little talk about

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,260
Guttenberg I'm not going to go too much

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,050
into Guttenberg because they there's a

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,390
workshop on it later they're gotten bar

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,980
so if anyone's really got to learn lots

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,430
about Guttenberg I recommend you go to

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:21,910
that but I will be covering it because

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:23,080
we need to it's out soon so I'm going to

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,840
just talk through the WordPress

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,030
dashboard first of all so if people with

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,160
laptops want to log in as well I'm just

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,810
going to talk through what you see when

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,010
you first log into WordPress

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,440
I've not gone through the installation

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,690
process because most hosts will help you

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,400
set up and that would take a good ten

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,470
minutes so we're just going to jump

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,560
straight into I have a brand new website

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,880
what do I do with it so when you first

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,910
install WordPress you'll get something

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,030
that looks like this which is a nice

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,590
page ready for you to use not sure if

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,120
it's exactly what I need just yet but

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,510
let's log in and see what we can do with

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,210
the new website when you first log into

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,419
WordPress you'll be given a as part of

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,700
the setup you're given a admin URL a

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:10,780
username and a password so when you log

00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,310
in you'll be able to see this and as

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,650
soon as you log in there's all these

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,060
different options and if you're brand

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,150
new to WordPress you might not quite

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,320
know where to get started so I'm just

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,250
going to talk through a few of the

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,350
sections and so this is your main

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,320
dashboard page any little bits of

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,820
information you can find ahead it's not

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,410
so useful in terms of actually doing

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,540
stuff for your website or you can find

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,470
out about WordPress events you can find

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,450
recent comments and post counts and

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,580
there's a lot of prompts for guttenberg

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,820
at the moment at the top not so little

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,800
it's actually huge but we'll pay

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,450
attention to that in a little bit

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,090
because will install Guttenberg and go

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,700
through that as well at the moment the

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,470
main places you will find yourself in

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,860
your WordPress dashboard are in the

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:03,039
posts and pages section so you can add

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,620
new blog posts in the post page pages is

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,039
for more static content which we'll go

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,390
through and add some a little Sharla if

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,050
you scroll down you've got a comment

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,910
section

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,440
anyone who comments on any post or page

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,220
on your site it will come up here so you

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,190
can approve it you can delete it you can

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,800
mark it as spam any kind of comment

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,200
management happens there the appearance

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,539
tab is where you handle your theme and

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,210
widgets mostly and you can also

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:34,570
configure your menus so the navigation

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,160
you go into the appearance menu and when

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:40,780
you click on themes you've already got

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,220
some theme setup plugins purely for

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,080
plugins would you believe it

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,420
you click on the plug-in section and

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,370
you'd mostly be using the add new

00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,980
section are you'd be activating our

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,830
deactivating plugins in this little area

00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,690
here and we'll go through configuring

00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,820
and later on I'm going to go through

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,190
configuring two popular plugins gonna do

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,050
contacts phone seven which is a plug-in

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,690
which adds a contacts volunteer site and

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,670
we're also going to do some little

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,860
configuring of Yoast and I'll show you

00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,560
what your stills as well because that's

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,450
a that's a plug-in to kind of review the

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,350
SEO and you say and it's quite a popular

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:21,490
one use this you can add and remove

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,320
users to your site and this is quite an

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,060
important area of the site because any

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,020
one you want to give access to your site

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,270
you would add them as a user here and

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,130
one of the big things that we see a lot

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:37,850
of people doing and it's not the best

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,500
idea is when you add a new user you need

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,810
to really think about the role you're

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,600
giving them because we see so many

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,810
people who just add everyone who manages

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,790
their site as an administrator so bear

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:54,860
in mind when you're adding people as

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:56,930
users there are several roles you can

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,720
assign them let's go through I did one

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,750
real quick so yeah add a new user here

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,300
give them a name and email address and

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,040
some little details here importantly

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,350
there's a role at the bottom the

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,000
subscriber can't really do much the

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,300
subscriber can basically and login to

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,660
the admin section and that's not a lot

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,720
much else they can do but as you go down

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:23,210
there's more and more privileges to

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,280
different users the administrator can do

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,350
absolutely everything it can install new

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,060
plugins change your theme they can

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,310
basically break your site if they wanted

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,039
to and hopefully the nice people and

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,539
wouldn't do that but just in case or

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,270
just in case they might do that by

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,930
accident you'd usually want to set new

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:44,330
people up as editors or ASUS authors can

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,850
write content but not publish it for the

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:50,420
most part and editors can add content

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,680
and publish it themselves but yeah you

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,820
don't want to be adding people as

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,209
administrators if you can help it well

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,179
they say

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:02,170
in the admin panel are the tools which

00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:04,100
have some out of the box they have some

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,309
import/export tools so if you want to

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,059
change hosting providers or do any kind

00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:12,290
of management of data for your site you

00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:15,110
can usually do it in here because

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,980
there's also the privacy export and

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:21,110
deletion tools were in this section and

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,869
lots of plugins add additional options

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,110
to the Tools menu which we'll go through

00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:30,619
how to find plug-in configuration

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:33,019
shortly one of the main places I find

00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:35,509
myself in the WordPress dashboard is the

00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:37,819
settings area and the settings has lots

00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:41,329
of useful little things you can do with

00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:44,329
your website so if you click on settings

00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:46,309
and then general you can change the name

00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:49,189
of your website you can change the

00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:50,449
tagline if you want to usually wouldn't

00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,610
play with the URLs

00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,929
unless you've been specifically told to

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,819
or you know what you're doing in terms

00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:57,559
of changing the name of your website

00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:59,749
because it can break a lot of things

00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,369
potentially but usually hosting

00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:05,569
providers will help you with that kind

00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:08,119
of administration on you say you can

00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:10,549
also um there's reading and writing

00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:12,889
options and this is for how people kind

00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:15,350
of interact with your site I find the

00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:19,670
reading tab particularly helpful because

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:22,790
you can set the homepage farmer so by

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,850
default WordPress websites when you go

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:29,240
to them on the home page you have a list

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,209
of blog posts whereas if you go back

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,910
into the general area you can assign a

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:37,309
specific page in not the general area

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,709
the reading area you can set a static

00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:42,949
page and you can make your own home page

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:45,679
so if I add a page called home I can say

00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:50,209
it's a sample page for example and give

00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:52,160
that save now I instead of having

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:55,129
different blog posts on the home page

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,170
just having a blog feed I can have a

00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:00,519
have a static page where I can write

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:04,309
something like welcome to my website and

00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,600
yeah you don't know you don't

00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:07,490
necessarily have to have the blog

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,889
straightaway on the home page and you

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,499
can reassign the blog posts to it

00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:16,129
front page as well so say that let's

00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:20,119
show you properly so if I go to pages

00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:26,709
add new and if I add blog and just

00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:32,769
publish that and go back into reading

00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:32,769
after creating my page who wants to load

00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,730
there we go

00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:40,970
you can set home page assets of a sample

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:47,089
page post page I can set to blog

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:49,329
never save that now if I go to might not

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:57,169
come up in the map navigation yet nope I

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:58,999
can go to forward slash blog blog and my

00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,980
posts now appear on the blog page and

00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:05,419
any posts I add will add to this blog

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,160
page so they're the main set they're the

00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:08,779
main areas and settings that are in the

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,999
dashboard once you first log in and

00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,429
we're gonna go through a few of them

00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,989
again because I'm going to set up some

00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,379
stuff on the website and talk you

00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:29,179
through setting some stuff up yourselves

00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:30,949
just minimize this cool so that's kind

00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:34,129
of the first introduction of just what

00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:35,540
each of these sections does and because

00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,949
it's a workshop I'm going to try and

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,779
take a break between little sections

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:40,489
does anyone have any is there anything

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,959
to do with the actual dashboard and

00:12:40,489 --> 00:13:07,179
finding things that you're not too sure

00:12:41,959 --> 00:13:07,179
about well good oh yeah okay okay cool

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:14,569
that's okay that's okay because if

00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,669
you're not ready with a question about

00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:18,439
the specific system section straight

00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:21,230
away at the end I'm going to come down

00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:36,400
and have a proper chat with yes

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:39,680
so yeah yeah yeah in turn that was

00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,380
specifically in terms of users basically

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,120
and if you go to the user section in

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,330
your site for that and just list all

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,310
users say you've got a web designer our

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:53,390
developer or someone on the site who

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:54,650
doesn't necessarily make her not so much

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,210
because they might want to change the

00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,710
theme on your site but if there's

00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:03,470
someone who logs in and their job is to

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:05,390
their job is to just add content just

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,080
make sure that their roles are not set

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:11,090
to administrator basically because

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,580
somewhere else that could happen is say

00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,440
someone has say you've got like five

00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,080
administrators and one of them has an

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,700
insecure password their account could be

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,100
compromised and suddenly someone else

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,950
can login as an administrator so it's

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,670
just really important that you set your

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:30,440
roles for your users appropriately and

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,080
we'll go through other ways sites can

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,150
break in plugins and things like that

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,640
but it's mostly fine and we're going to

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,980
go through selecting plug-ins that are

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,930
usually more reliable and the kind of

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:48,100
things to look out for but yeah don't

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:51,200
worry yes oh it shouldn't break right

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,060
what we're going to do now is click

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,770
practice we're going to go through

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:59,780
changing the theme on your site and

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,760
WordPress has a ton of themes that you

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,520
can choose from and I'll just show you

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,620
how to install a theme and change a few

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,720
settings on it different themes will

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:12,080
have very different various ways of

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,940
doing this most of the time themes come

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:19,160
with documentation on their website so

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,430
we'll just add one as an example so if

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,570
you go into a parent and then themes

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,160
you've got some default themes here

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,160
which you can have a play with I

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,710
particularly like 2015 out of the

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,560
default ones that's my favorite so you

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,060
can activate that one if you wish to you

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,590
can also

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,450
to this corner here and if you like

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,460
these themes are a bit boring I want

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,880
something a bit more exciting you can go

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:47,690
to add a new theme lit up and this will

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:50,210
load you a lot of themes you will how

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,110
you'll be put on the featured section

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,180
straightaway

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,920
which these are the themes which

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,490
WordPress thinks are pretty cool right

00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,710
now popular themes is a good one to look

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,150
at I usually have a browser the popular

00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,400
themes because these are the themes

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,680
other people are using and ones that

00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,260
they think are quite good so you can

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,390
choose one from here but if you've got

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,870
something specific in mind for how you

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:16,700
want your site to look there's a little

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,670
feature filter at the top of the themes

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,580
area and you can click on that and it

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,710
gives you all these little tick boxes

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:31,370
that you can select so for example say I

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:35,000
want a food and drink website with two

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,880
columns so I want my main content and a

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,340
little sidebar hopefully when I apply

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,750
filters it will find me appropriate

00:16:40,340 --> 00:17:00,380
blogs for that purpose and straight away

00:16:43,750 --> 00:17:03,050
yeah right that's okay okay okay well

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,600
hopefully that's a bit better now cool

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,490
and yeah so you can use the feature

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,450
filter if you've got something specific

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:14,210
in mind for what you want to want what

00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,550
you want your website to look like so I

00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,560
can install this first one because

00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,470
that's got what I wanted it looks like

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:27,080
it's made for food websites and it's got

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:29,810
one column activate and now some themes

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,610
come with bundled in plugins which I

00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,200
will ignore that for now because we'll

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,320
go through plugins as a separate thing

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,960
but if I go to my website after

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,840
activating that theme my website looks

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,150
completely different now which is good

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,280
because I didn't want my website to look

00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,830
like it did before so that's how you

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,930
install and add themes

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:55,790
some themes will come with different

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:58,670
options let's see if this one did so to

00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:02,360
access most of the theme customizable

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:04,070
options when you go into the appearance

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,640
and themes area there's a little

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:10,250
customize button here and some older

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,000
themes have a theme options tab on the

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,860
sidebar and there might be a separate

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,040
section specifically far themed stuff

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,800
and best thing to do if you're not sure

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,580
how to customize your theme if you click

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,610
on the theme in the appearance area you

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,590
can go to the website of the theme and a

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,930
lot of good themes have quite

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:37,340
substantial documentation and we'll show

00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,720
you how to edit them but hopefully it's

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,060
nice and simple you can click on

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,590
customize from the appearance area and

00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:47,090
it should give you some specific theme

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:49,460
options here so I can change colors on

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:53,140
this theme so I can change my footer

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:57,430
color let's go for a nice bright pink

00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:00,220
because I'm great at web design Oh

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,960
doesn't look like it's done much okay

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,460
let's dissipate in furless theme let's

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:11,000
go for a background color in that case

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:12,920
ah yes that is hideous for but yet a

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,360
different themes we'll have a lot of

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,850
different options this one's got an

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,500
option to upgrade to a pro version so I

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,230
imagine if I downloaded the pro version

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,640
I'd have even more options there but

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,250
just to show you the kind of things you

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,510
can do and certain themes will have tons

00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,130
of these options they'll let you

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,580
customize every a little bit of it to

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:34,310
different fonts different colors for

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,100
different widgets and some of them have

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,450
a lot of different options so if you

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,390
want to tweak the appearance of your

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:44,090
website you can go into the customize

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:49,460
area and usually find ways to edit your

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:53,300
theme that way and I think that's it for

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,250
the basic theme stuff and is anyone not

00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,440
sure about anything to do with adding

00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,440
themes are configuring them at all

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:24,940
yeah yeah yeah that is a very good

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,650
question because a lot of the themes

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,870
don't actually look like what they do in

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:32,710
the preview image which can be super

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,300
frustrating and that's when I usually go

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,610
to the documentation on their website

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,929
because the vast majority of themes I've

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:44,020
come across if they for example this one

00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:45,429
that I have added it from the preview

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,380
image it looks like it's got some sort

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:50,830
of slider I couldn't find any slide

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:58,179
eruption and let's see if we go to the

00:20:50,830 --> 00:21:00,190
website it should tell us how to add one

00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:03,870
somewhere support theme documentation

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:07,120
right there and we can find the theme

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:09,450
documentation for food occur it was free

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,380
to kalaiy I was on because it wasn't

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:16,990
paid for within the preview image

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,210
usually it's because it's just suddenly

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,650
not obvious but a lot of themes are

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:36,010
really good like this and we'll have the

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:38,020
documentation for it yes yes yes the

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,170
website won't be owned by owned by

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,510
WordPress no it will be owned by the

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,280
theme provider and when you submit a

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,260
theme to the WordPress repository it

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,740
asks you to provide a website for

00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:53,740
documentation and so yeah it will link

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,660
you to that company's website are that

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,590
developer whoever made the theme well

00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:02,100
it's not actually a WordPress out it is

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,260
naturally a website that wordpress.org

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:09,280
have made themselves or administer at

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:11,260
all and so yeah depending on the theme

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,750
it might not have the best documentation

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,520
but in

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,440
Stickley in the popular section and

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,120
towards the top most of the themes

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,660
people are downloading the download and

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,450
cuz they're quite good and usable and so

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,350
if you see a theme that's potentially

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:37,450
maybe it's not got fantastic ratings

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:42,460
jumped over to Edinburgh on that go back

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:46,050
to modes so yeah if you go to theme

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:49,350
details and for an option to display

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,350
give me a set

00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,080
I'm just checking if themes actually

00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,650
yeah you don't have radians

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:03,370
oh there we go if you click on them in

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:06,090
when you're searching for a theme so on

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:09,070
this page when you go to add a new theme

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:13,180
anything you're looking at you can click

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:16,090
on and it'll have a rating I if a theme

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,410
has maybe a one or two star rating I'd

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,180
imagine other people have probably

00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,910
struggled to make it look how they want

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,760
it so that's something to bear in mind

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,890
but yeah I'd honestly if you're not too

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,380
sure how to use a theme the first

00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,110
particle would be the website that links

00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,030
to in your appearance section because

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:43,570
most people are nice and tell you how to

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:47,170
use things just going to go through

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:50,200
creating some pages and I will mildly

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:53,200
cover the new way of managing content

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,990
we've gotten big here so at the moment

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,390
when you have a brand new website and

00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:01,600
you want to add some content you might

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:04,210
do it in a post or a page and as I said

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,760
before post sir more for the blog style

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:10,210
type of content where it's date specific

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,250
and it will appear on the website in a

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,990
feed farm at so it will scroll up as you

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:19,390
are it'll scroll down the page as you

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:22,090
add more posts and whereas pages are

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,440
more for static content so the content

00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,970
that doesn't change like if you have a

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,520
contact form and you said you'd put that

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,429
in a page not in a post and

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,420
just anything that doesn't really change

00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:36,550
so a lot of quick post and this is what

00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,840
the current editor looks like which will

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:50,040
go through the other one at the end

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:53,140
and so I'm gonna post today at wordcamp

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,450
so you can set a title there and then

00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,900
add some content here and the current

00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:01,540
editor is quite similar to I guess if

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,750
anyone's use word before and you've got

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,450
tools to do bold italics it's fairly

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,420
straightforward basic stuff you can set

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:16,150
different paragraph types so if I want a

00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:18,490
heading here I that will change the type

00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:25,390
of font I'm using and make in a big

00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:29,410
header then I can add a paragraph and to

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:31,809
the side I've got some settings for my

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,790
post so you can set categories so say

00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:36,790
you blog about multiple different things

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:41,500
and you can set a category so I can add

00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:43,720
a category for word camps I can add a

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,160
category for food because apparently I

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,130
was making this a food blog but I've

00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:51,820
just posted about word camps my content

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,230
is on point so you can add categories I

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,080
recommend that you do add categories

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,700
because you can when people are browsing

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,020
your site they can browse between

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,380
different categories if you give them

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,780
the option and it just makes it that bit

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,330
more nice and readable or you can add

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,100
tags as well which function in a similar

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:12,460
manner so certain posts with certain

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:15,309
tags will group together depending how

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,809
you display them so I'd probably put

00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:22,200
this in a similar way to my categories

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:24,790
you can also set a featured image which

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,460
what you do here is you click on this

00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:29,650
and upload an image to the site and the

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:32,140
featured image and is usually something

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:36,910
themed specific which depending on the

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:40,659
theme it will display it in a nice kind

00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:42,820
of glorious way

00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:47,919
and I'll show you what I mean let's get

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:51,309
a nice picture of a pop there there we

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:54,809
go that one's cute and I don't recommend

00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:57,549
taking random images off websites really

00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:01,629
but I'll get rid of this website y'all

00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:04,869
don't judge me so I can click on

00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:08,049
featured image set featured image now if

00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:11,619
I go back to the top I can preview this

00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:13,419
post and see how it looks and there we

00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:16,989
go you can see that the featured image

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:18,580
comes above the title of my page there

00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:21,029
because it's a featured one it's not

00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,499
actually part of the content and

00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:26,499
depending on the theme it might display

00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:28,570
that in a big banner at the top it might

00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:30,429
do it other side different themes will

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:34,929
display featured images in different

00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:37,330
ways so you can set those per theme as

00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:40,629
well which is quite nice publish that

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:43,720
for now and now my post is live on my

00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:47,259
site you can also change on the status

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,149
area here you can also choose one for a

00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:53,710
post can go out you can set as a draft

00:27:49,149 --> 00:28:00,759
so if I go here I can change this to go

00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:02,919
out tomorrow at 10:00 if I wanted so you

00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,739
can choose one contents published say

00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,179
you have a lot of date specific content

00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:10,539
you can get all written off and then

00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:15,249
WordPress can and take care of posting

00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:17,549
it when you actually need it and now

00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:21,099
that now if I go back to my website

00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:26,970
because my theme has this already built

00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:30,249
into it not this let me start again and

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:34,479
the sidebar has now added my categories

00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:37,149
and it's got an archive because I did a

00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:39,460
post at November I might not

00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:42,999
specifically want some of this content

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:45,940
so I'm gonna just have a quick talk

00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:49,029
about widgets as well so if I go into

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:51,039
back into my parents area there's a

00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:54,670
widget section as well and widgets a

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,730
little blocks of content which

00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,990
the sidebar of your website and

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,600
depending on the theme again a lot of

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:06,820
where stuff appears depends on your

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:09,760
specific theme so for my theme which

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,770
I've chosen in the widgets area I've got

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,840
these sections to the side which are

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:17,980
different areas for different widgets to

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:25,270
appear so like we saw let me open under

00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:28,900
the tab with this yeah so my sidebar at

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:31,690
the moment has a search widget at the

00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,820
very top recent posts recent comments

00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:38,860
and archives I'm going to get rid of the

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:40,630
archives because I don't want them there

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,350
so I can just click archives in my

00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:48,400
widget area and delete that there I'm

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:52,630
gonna change my search bar to be in the

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,850
footer I don't know why but I can this

00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,679
doesn't have a Save button the widgets

00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,020
area automatically saves these changes

00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:05,049
that you make so if I just refresh this

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:07,299
page you'll see that my search bar that

00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:10,750
was here has gone there's one at the top

00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:13,059
as well but now I have search in my foot

00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:16,030
so you can customize the location of

00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:18,960
content using widgets and different

00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:21,309
plugins will add different widgets so

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,919
you might want a widget to show

00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:25,990
something like an Instagram feed there's

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,780
a plug-in for that so you can install

00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,400
that plug-in and then choose where some

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:38,260
Instagram pictures would go for example

00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:40,030
and that's how the widgets work go over

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:44,770
to creating pages because I got a little

00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:47,049
sidetracked when you add a page very

00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,000
similar to when we added the blog post

00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:51,880
it's exactly the same kind of

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,160
information in terms of you can set a

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,870
title you've got your little word like

00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,990
editor area where you can add the

00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:00,340
content that you want to and but you

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,620
don't have things like Catterick

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,630
categories and tags and stuff like that

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:08,710
because this is very much for just

00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,630
static content that just has an infant

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:15,279
that doesn't really need that kind of

00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:21,960
stuff so if I add a page for contact

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,960
I can add some contact details here and

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:31,240
publish a page and people can go to that

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:34,450
page and have that information I'm going

00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,279
to just go into menus because at the

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,490
moment I've added these different pages

00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:40,929
these different posts I don't know how

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,789
people are gonna find them because they

00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:45,130
don't have any kind of navigation or

00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:50,710
anything too useful for getting around

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:53,679
my site at the moment so if you go back

00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:57,279
into the dashboard there is again under

00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:01,330
the appearance menu there is a menus

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,760
option and you can add navigation bars

00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:08,620
with exactly what you want them to in

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:12,159
this area and you can add menus in the

00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:14,380
admin panel here but what in what I find

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,440
more useful is if I click through to the

00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:22,750
front of my website and then click on

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:26,350
the customize button at the top you can

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,880
also add menus in the customizer and the

00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,559
reason I prefer to do it this way is

00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,960
because you'll get a live preview as

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,279
you're adding them so that's two

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,260
different ways you can add menus you can

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,360
add them all in the backend and then go

00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,520
over to the site but if you go into the

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,220
customize option at the top click on

00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:45,159
menus and then you can click on create

00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:53,260
new menu and I'm just going to give my

00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:55,440
menu a name so navigation and then it

00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,539
will ask me to set a menu location and

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,299
again different themes different options

00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:04,720
this theme allows me to add a menu to

00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:06,640
the top a main menu or a footer menu I'm

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,720
just gonna make this my main menu and

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,919
see where that comes up I click Next I

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,870
need to add an item to it

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,450
so if I click add items I'm going to add

00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:19,330
my homepage my contacts page and my blog

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:21,940
page and then you can drag and drop them

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,480
so I can move my blog page up you can

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,480
nest

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,020
Agis so I can add my some sample page

00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:33,700
and look at two of them apparently

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:35,890
let's not add two of them and you can

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,660
nest them under and you can see it's got

00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:41,169
a little indent so this will appear

00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:43,299
under the contact page so if I have a

00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:45,640
look here the preview has already done

00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:48,309
this farmer I've got my home page my

00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,980
blog page contacts page with a little

00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:53,940
sub page which is my sample page and

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,960
that's how it translates on suicide

00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,790
we're going to get rid of the sample

00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:03,490
page and publish that and now I have

00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,290
some navigation for my site and you'll

00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,120
be able to add that in the menus area

00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:09,730
and people can use that to navigate

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,419
around your site let's add it to the

00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:17,429
footer as well and see what that does

00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:19,869
there's where my bright pink is okay

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:23,710
since my bright Pink's around publish

00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:25,720
that yeah so when it comes to the

00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,810
customer customizing of the appearance

00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,520
of your site beyond looking at

00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:33,399
documentation and finding out what does

00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,369
what a lot of it is kind of just playing

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,530
around and just try different things

00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:44,710
you'll see what works and what doesn't

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:46,240
few specific themes and yeah um is there

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,609
any questions will forget cuz I've

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,159
covered a lot there I'm gonna take a

00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:53,470
little moment is there anyone who's not

00:34:51,159 --> 00:35:28,390
sure about menus posts pages any

00:34:53,470 --> 00:35:29,730
questions about that yep yeah so oh ok

00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,730
so when you're sharing it on Facebook

00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,730
okay

00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,590
yeah and I don't know exactly how

00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:45,650
Facebook chooses the specific picture

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,300
but something I'm gonna go through in a

00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,150
little bit is configuring the Yoast

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,830
plugin and one of the features of the

00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,170
u.s. plug-in is it will let you choose

00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:57,080
the picture for the social post and

00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:58,609
pretty sure so I will show you how I'm

00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,190
going to do plugins next so we'll go

00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:03,470
into that and you might be basically you

00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:07,390
might be able to use Yoast to decide

00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:11,830
what comes up on your social post um

00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:14,660
this is for wordpress.org websites and I

00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:17,390
I'm not too sure if you can add your

00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,160
storm wordpress.com or not and if you

00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,890
can add Yoast you can probably do it and

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:28,960
I'm happy to sit down and have a lot

00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:28,960
with yeah by all means okay

00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,710
and that usually depends on the theme

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:51,720
because some of them in the customize

00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:55,050
menu will have a photo section and they

00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,480
can remove credit if they want a lot of

00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,430
themes won't let you do that and because

00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,000
they want to be credited for the theme

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:05,010
that they've produced and you could be

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,370
cheeky and maybe edit it in the code so

00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,920
it doesn't appear but I wouldn't

00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,150
necessarily recommend it because

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,830
basically if the theme wants credit and

00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:17,490
they've done the work and it's a free

00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:19,560
thing you may the general kind of

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,050
attitude is that they deserve the credit

00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,330
for the work they've done and but some

00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,880
themes will let you remove the credit if

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,770
you don't want it there that that will

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:35,400
be in the customize menu if they're ok

00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:38,070
with it that's ok I could and there's

00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,630
plenty of people who don't necessarily

00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:44,580
want this random link to another site at

00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:46,110
the foot or so and because I've realized

00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,510
that it's quite a - I'm going to quickly

00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,850
go through and guttenberg and how it

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,760
differs and then we've got a configure

00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:55,740
Yoast and then I'll come down and we'll

00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,330
see what we can do I think the fire

00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,660
alarm is going to go off somewhere

00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:03,360
during the session and we'll just give

00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:09,360
it a minute and don't carry that right

00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:12,420
so um currently when you go to add a

00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,210
post or page as I mentioned this is how

00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,420
it looks you can add your title and it

00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:20,640
looks very much like Microsoft Word in a

00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,070
way and it's something that user quite

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,040
familiar with for the most part and you

00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:29,520
can add content and use this bar should

00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:33,240
do it that's all changing

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,440
in a couple of weeks I believe the

00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,970
current release day is the 27th

00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,380
WordPress is changing the editor

00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:45,540
interface and it's using Guttenberg

00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,390
which at the moment Guttenberg is a

00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,280
plug-in but it's going to be built into

00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:54,540
core and this will be the new way you

00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:57,119
edit posts and pages so to show you what

00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,640
that's going to look like and this is

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,410
why on the home page when you when you

00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,880
log in to your dashboard straight away

00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,890
you've got this big prompts to try

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,710
Guttenberg before it's released so you

00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:09,690
can familiarize yourself with it so I'm

00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:12,930
gonna activate Guttenberg on my site so

00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:14,460
I can show you how that differs as soon

00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,770
as you activate Guttenberg it will show

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,630
you a preview page but I'm gonna go

00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,420
through it with you separately anyway so

00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:24,599
got some bugs activated same as before

00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:29,040
I'm gonna go to add a post if I go to

00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:31,470
add new it's got a little tutorial there

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,330
but I'm gonna show you anyway when you

00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:38,180
go to add a post it'll look like this

00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:40,500
instead which is very different and and

00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,780
from the look of it it looks like

00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,580
something completely new but it actually

00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,970
all the same stuff as before he's in

00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,310
there

00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:49,770
you've just it's just a new way of doing

00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,869
the same thing so as soon as you click

00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,750
on Guttenberg you've got add a title and

00:40:51,869 --> 00:41:01,740
then below you can add some content so

00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:04,500
let's do what I did before I've set my

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:09,180
title but click down below I can add a

00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:11,480
paragraph of text we've gotten Berg and

00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,690
rather than having everything in one

00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:18,480
word like editor Guttenberg handles

00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:21,410
different content types in blocks and

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,440
what blocks are this header is a block

00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:28,589
that is a header type block this is a

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,660
paragraph block if I press ENTER to

00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:36,690
start a new paragraph it does a new

00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:39,119
paragraph block no luck and when I hover

00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:41,810
over it I can see how these blocks are

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,810
highlighted

00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:51,650
I can choose to move them if I wish hmm

00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:54,290
I can add there we go

00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:57,440
if I want to use the arrows to the side

00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:00,680
I can move them I can drag them up and

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:04,010
down I can add different types of blocks

00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,840
the what I'd recommend usually when

00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,580
people are asking me to get them started

00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,600
we've got some good adding different

00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,880
block types

00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:15,440
the easiest way to do it is to use this

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:19,340
plus in the corner so I can add an image

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:23,870
from there let's go to my media library

00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:30,260
and add our dog in here and then I've

00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:31,940
got a little caption area here and yeah

00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,120
this is B this is basically how

00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,810
gottenberg works I'm trying not to go

00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,160
too deep into it because I could I'm

00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:43,360
going go into it for ages because

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,280
because it's such a new thing it's

00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:49,040
people are asking us a lot of questions

00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:52,400
on how to add content and do different

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,220
things we've gotten Berg but basically

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,340
it's just a case of instead of having a

00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:02,930
paragraph of different types of context

00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:06,340
like headers images all in one set

00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:12,290
location you add things block by block

00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:14,240
and if you go to the side menu here this

00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:17,630
is all the same stuff that was on the

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,540
classic editor so you can set your

00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:23,000
categories you can change the permalink

00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,470
of your website which it this is all

00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,930
stuff that's doable on the classical

00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:29,300
editor it's just it's just a new way of

00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:31,430
doing it and if people want to learn

00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,940
more about Guttenberg I highly recommend

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:36,380
going to the Gotham Bar later on and

00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:38,000
because I'll be there and I'm happy to

00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,330
sit down with people and create some

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,750
posts in Guttenberg and yeah I really

00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:48,320
hope people give it a shot before before

00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:53,050
it comes out and then yeah it might be a

00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,420
little bit confusing can add our tags

00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:59,520
but yeah

00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:01,710
if I publish that works exactly the same

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,930
way and it's the same four pages as well

00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:07,470
that's the same kind of content I could

00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:10,590
create in the classic head out it's just

00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:12,210
a little bit more it I feel like it's a

00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,950
different kind of mentality to adding

00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,140
content because you do things block by

00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:19,920
block instead of just here's all my

00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,660
content so yeah if you are starting a

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,320
new site I'd recommend giving Guttenberg

00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:28,770
a try sooner rather than later because

00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:39,110
it's what's gonna come in core soon and

00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:42,630
yeah it'll be they'll be fine and it's

00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:45,900
not not so much should be design tool as

00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:47,340
more of a content ad until you can you

00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,890
don't think of it as something that kind

00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,780
of changes the overall appearance of

00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,330
your site you can have different locking

00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,760
pages like you can set cover images for

00:44:54,330 --> 00:45:00,240
pages depending how your theme looks and

00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,120
but I tell people mostly to think of

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,840
this as just the same way you add a blog

00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,250
post and if you want to edit the way the

00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,190
site looks it's always going to be

00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,090
something more to do with the theme and

00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:18,000
choices you make in the appearance

00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:19,770
section and but yeah if anyone's unsure

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,270
about Guttenberg and the guts and

00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,300
barley' around it should be really

00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:26,760
helpful okay

00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,920
I'm gonna quickly add a plug-in before

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,480
the fire alarm goes off that's kind of

00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,240
my tent engine so adding a plug-in go to

00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:40,080
the plugins menu add new plug-in and I'm

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:44,760
gonna install the popular plug-in Yoast

00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:47,880
SEO and what your stores is and it's

00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,220
basically kind of like a review plug-in

00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,110
for your content which I'll show you

00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,420
what I mean in a second so I've clicked

00:45:52,110 --> 00:46:00,150
so I've searched first installed it

00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:02,880
click to activate and that's installing

00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,180
Yoast on my site now and hopefully it

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,180
will refresh

00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:13,660
there we go so that takes me back to my

00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,609
plugins page and I can see that

00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,880
Yoast at the bottom is activated

00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:21,520
different plugins are different contents

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,960
are different areas of your site so when

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,630
you install a plug-in it can be really

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,359
unclear what's actually changed luckily

00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:31,660
it's similar reads to be similarly to

00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:35,530
with the theme if you go to the plugins

00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:38,290
area and click on the view details this

00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:40,960
gives you the plugins page on the

00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,520
WordPress repository so say you add a

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,270
slider plug-in and you're not sure how

00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,099
to use it

00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:49,020
you can click on View details and

00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:51,400
there's FAQ sections and screenshots

00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,040
sometimes are helpful but you can also

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,540
click on the plug-in home page which

00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,020
will take you to the developers home

00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,359
page

00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,160
and you can find documentation there or

00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:02,560
you can go to the WordPress to add

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,270
plug-in page and there's forums and you

00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,490
can ask questions and people will

00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:08,950
generally try to help you use the

00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,359
plug-in but yeah if you're not sure how

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,450
to use a plug-in as soon as you install

00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:16,119
it you can find that information there I

00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:20,339
know what yours so I'm going to quickly

00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:24,250
show you when I go to add a new post on

00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:26,950
my page actually yeah yeah let's leave

00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:30,099
got some Berger because this is this is

00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:36,849
the way it's gonna be so I can create my

00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:38,440
I'm very diverse on my content so I can

00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:54,099
create a post about word counts

00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:56,140
I won't type today so I've created a

00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:58,900
post now you might have noticed that

00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:01,960
below my post content now I have this

00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:05,319
little Yoast SEO tab and this this is

00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,150
what Yoast does it doesn't do you can't

00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:09,010
actively see it doing too much most of

00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,349
the time but this is what the Yoast

00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:15,339
plug-in does it basically reads your

00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:19,450
content and gives you a review of how

00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:23,140
SEO friendly Yoast thinks it is so

00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:25,410
the way it usually works is what I do is

00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,849
I go down to the focus key phrase and

00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:30,970
type in basically when you create

00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:33,460
content and hope you might have a

00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:35,829
keyword in mind or there's a specific

00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:38,260
thing your post is about and when you go

00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:40,510
onto Google oh I want people to type in

00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:43,690
this and see my blog post so I want

00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:46,329
people to type in word camp and see my

00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:49,839
blog post and as soon as that type of

00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:52,630
word camp I get this very angry looking

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,900
red smiler I don't think the angry

00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:58,900
smiley suggests that I'm doing good SEO

00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:02,910
if I scroll down it's gave me this extra

00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:05,410
information here so basically Yoast is

00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:07,690
kind of color-coordinating what's good

00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,940
and what's not so I've got a few good

00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:12,760
points there which are the green dots so

00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,720
key phrases in the introduction yes

00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:19,990
that's quote for SEO key phrase length

00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:22,599
yep these are I've not done a lot to

00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:26,829
make this post very good and but

00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:28,779
hopefully Yoast gives you the red and

00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:31,839
orange marks and it tells you white

00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:33,579
thinks you can improve on per post so

00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,619
for example it tells me I should add

00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:38,440
internal links so I should link to other

00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:41,319
pages on my site I should add the key

00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,660
phrase in my title which I put word

00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:46,299
camps if I changed that you can kind of

00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,130
fool it and now I've got a green mark

00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:52,660
but I can't imagine that real it helps

00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:55,089
my SEO at all so and what I'd say with

00:49:52,660 --> 00:50:00,700
Yoast is some of its helpful some of it

00:49:55,089 --> 00:50:02,769
and can be cheated a bit so what I

00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,140
usually say reviews is write your

00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:07,839
content how you want it have a look at

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:11,890
what Yoast makes of it you're always

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,920
going to get some red some green some

00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:18,190
orange I wouldn't necessarily try to get

00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,680
every single dark green because you'll

00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,799
end up with a post that sounds very

00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:25,089
robotic because you've been just trying

00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:30,940
to please your so you've not been trying

00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:33,070
to write this nice fluent blog post what

00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,830
I usually do with Yoast is

00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:37,930
I write a blog post have a look over

00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:40,420
this and I'm like oh yeah I could add an

00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:42,760
internal link here I can make I can add

00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:46,750
a few more words for the post count and

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:48,570
then when you publish it are just saying

00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:53,140
it you don't have to publish it

00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:55,930
this icon at the very top is kind of an

00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,870
overall score so my overall score is

00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:01,840
more in the orange than the kind of red

00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:04,120
area so I so I kind of got that one more

00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,890
than trying to please every single green

00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,480
mark because every time I tried to

00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:10,960
please every single green mark on Yoast

00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:14,560
my post sounds like complete rubbish but

00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,900
Yoast is is a very popular and very good

00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,640
plug-in for just kind of giving you a

00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,920
little bit of feedback on the content

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,440
that you're doing so I wouldn't take

00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,990
everything it says as you have to do

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,270
this it's just more of a Oh fYI you

00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:31,240
could add a few links you can do this

00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:33,430
and yeah if something sounds reasonable

00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,760
and sounds quite natural for the post

00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:40,960
then yeah I do what you tells you to do

00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:43,060
and that that's an example of adding a

00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,060
plug-in and using it on your website you

00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:48,430
can add plugins for contacts files which

00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:53,350
fire alarms about to go off any second

00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:55,390
but let's give that a go so if I go to

00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,620
add a different type of plug-in I can

00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:59,320
show you how it's completely different

00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:02,980
to Yoast and how you don't do any of the

00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:05,530
same stuff so but well apart from the

00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:08,260
added private process going to plugins

00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:11,440
add new I want to add a contact form

00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:15,100
plug-in because I don't have a contact

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,880
form on my site by typing contact form

00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:21,340
and I'm gonna go for the first plug-in

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,980
that I see here which is contact form 7

00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:25,450
it's got over a million active

00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,630
installations and a really good rating

00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:30,490
so I think that sounds pretty good I'll

00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:33,280
install that there's tons of contact

00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:36,640
form plugins 127 returned in that search

00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:40,270
so if I didn't like contact form 7 I

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,870
could probably find one that ideal will

00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,870
activate that

00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:51,300
and again I go to the plugin page and it

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,660
doesn't look like a lots really changed

00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:57,170
and I don't know why I expected I want

00:52:54,660 --> 00:53:01,260
to add a contact form to my site and I

00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:02,940
know it's this there's contact two in my

00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,700
sidebar now so I can click on that and

00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:08,190
this is what contact form 7 does it

00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:11,640
basically allows you to create new

00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:14,040
contacts farms here ah it gives you a

00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:17,340
very basic corn out of the box and it

00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:19,110
adds this little each contact farm has

00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:23,730
something called a shortcode assigned to

00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:26,430
it so I can copy that I can copy that

00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:28,610
shortcode and if I go to a page maybe

00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:31,530
the contact page that I created before

00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:34,770
click on that and this is how short

00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:37,590
codes works work a lot of plugins out

00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:40,470
use short codes to allow you to place

00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:43,160
bits of content where you want them so

00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:47,130
if I paste that in there in my content

00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:53,420
update that hopefully when I preview I

00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:55,320
might have a contact form and I do hey

00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:59,520
that's a good question

00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:02,250
if you by default contact form 7 will

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,290
send the email to the admin email on

00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,290
your website so the one that's in the

00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:09,840
settings area but you can change that so

00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:14,120
if I go back into contact click on the

00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,120
contact form that I added to my website

00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:22,980
there is a settings area that's not the

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:27,330
right one no mail is the table master

00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:29,550
and by default it's set to use my email

00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,590
my email that I signed up to the website

00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:33,180
with I can change that to whatever I

00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:34,650
want so different contact farmers you

00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,720
can put two different email say you've

00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,410
got a contact form that should be going

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,900
to

00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,900
