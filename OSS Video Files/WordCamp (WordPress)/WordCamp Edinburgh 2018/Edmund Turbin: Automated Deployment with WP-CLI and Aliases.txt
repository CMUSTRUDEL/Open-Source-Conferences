Title: Edmund Turbin: Automated Deployment with WP-CLI and Aliases
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Edinburgh 2018
Description: 
	WP-CLI has introduced new ways of working with WordPress via automated commands and scripts. Aliases allow WP-CLI commands to be run on remote servers. Put them together and you have a powerful foundation to run automated processes remotely on multiple servers.
This talk will focus on using WP-CLI to automate deployment of a WordPress database between a development and production website. WP-CLI commands will be joined together in a BASH script that can be executed from the command line.
