Title: Neil Scott: Improving the User Experience of your WordPress sites
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Edinburgh 2018
Description: 
	WordPress is known for pre-made themes that make it easy to get started. However, after a while you might wonder why certain design decisions have been made, how they affect your users, and what you can do to make the site better.
This is where User Experience (UX) design techniques comes in. UX is way of bringing together user needs and business goals through research, testing, and design.
This talk will introduce the concept of UX and provide practical tips for improving your site.

thank you very much and really delighted

00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,510
to be here I was here last year and had

00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:17,170
a great time it was so good I got

00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,460
t-shirt but yeah like I say I really

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,750
like work first from the WordPress

00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:26,980
community because it does empower people

00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:29,199
in a world full of kind of social media

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,309
sites where you're restricted to a kind

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,649
of little box as to what you can publish

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,479
WordPress gives us this opportunity to

00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:41,199
take ownership of you know everything

00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:43,809
from the design of our sites the content

00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:47,800
all the photography and even you know

00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:52,719
security issues so what I'm going to be

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:55,510
talking about today is the user

00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:01,089
experience of the sites particularly if

00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:06,790
you have downloaded a site from the

00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:07,990
WordPress theme so pre-made themes say I

00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,500
don't know if you've seen this screen

00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:15,510
this is when you go on wordpress.com and

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:19,140
you have a huge variety of different

00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:23,380
designs that you can choose from

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,430
I'm like in a bit of feedback now the

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:29,170
thing is right like none of us live in

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:34,270
California and the content we have

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:40,930
doesn't look like any of this it more

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:44,310
often looks like this and so the trouble

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:48,070
is right like we have to adapt things to

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:51,010
how our sites work we have to make

00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,170
decisions we have to design things and

00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,940
so this is where user experience design

00:01:53,170 --> 00:02:05,410
comes in and so the first question we

00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:09,790
might want to ask is well if okay what

00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,740
is user experience design so does anyone

00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,150
have a good definition of user

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:26,440
experience design that they want to

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:32,050
share from I made at the back okay and

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:34,600
anyone else that's good in accessible

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,810
way does everyone put your hand up if

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,040
that you don't know what user experience

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,290
design is or you've never heard of user

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,850
experience does that say one person

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:48,850
there you may have seen this photo and I

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,400
like this photo is problematic in some

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,310
ways but what I like about it is that it

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,670
illustrates the breakdown between the

00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:03,970
designers intent and the actual users

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:06,220
experience and so you know like the

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,830
designer had a good idea of how this was

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,739
going to work and the consumer the user

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,989
just walked straight over it what is

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:17,019
problematic about this photo is it

00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:18,970
doesn't show true usage so we don't know

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,010
how many people are walking across the

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,780
mud we don't know what it's like when

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,260
it's rainy and people don't want to get

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,549
mud on their shoes and importantly we

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,510
don't know about accessibility

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,410
requirements so the the muddy path is

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,020
not going to be good

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:42,490
people that you know maybe can't get up

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:45,760
the curb forever reason so this is a

00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:48,040
diagram from Jesse James Garrett in his

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,250
book the elements of user experience and

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,500
this came out in about 2003 and really

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,410
helped promote the idea of user

00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:00,340
experience design amongst the web design

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:04,600
community and the way it's presented is

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,940
as a design process so previously people

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,990
would just design a site do some HTML

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,510
put their content up and be done with it

00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:16,420
whereas in here people started thinking

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:21,520
about navigation design information

00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:27,160
architecture content strategy and user

00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:31,360
needs and project objectives this is Don

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,390
Norman and he was the first person to

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,560
have user experience designer in his job

00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,200
title in the 80s at Apple and he wrote

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,480
this book the design of everyday things

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,540
about usability problems and his

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,220
definition of user experience design is

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,580
that user experience encompasses all

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,850
aspects of the end users interaction

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:58,440
with the company its services and its

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:01,960
products so this is a very broad

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:07,480
definition of user experience going way

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,370
beyond just usability and things like

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,970
that so I think it's more interesting to

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:18,250
ask why is UX like why do we have it why

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,870
do we need to think about UX this is a

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,800
good reason why we need to because we'll

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:27,940
be in the middle of a presentation and

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:33,100
the computer will stop showing okay so

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,870
why is UX and I think it is helpful to

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,050
think about this in the context of

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,330
Maslow's hierarchy of needs so you may

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,260
know mastopyra give me as it basically

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,620
suggests that if we're hungry and we

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,570
lack shelter

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,060
we can't think very much about the

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:54,770
meaning of life about self-actualization

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,940
and we can translate this into terms on

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,190
the web with a hierarchy of user needs

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,740
so at the very base level your site must

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:07,210
be functional for someone to access it

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:11,330
it must be reliable usable and

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:15,050
convenient and beyond that you get

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,120
experiences which makes something that

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,449
you want to come back to again and again

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,050
and we can see plenty of examples in web

00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:26,930
history where user experience was a

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:32,840
differentiator it was a competitive

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:35,150
asset so an early example is the

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,360
difference between Yahoo and AltaVista

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:42,949
and Google so if we go back to that

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:46,580
hierarchy whilst the Yahoo site is

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:51,289
functional reliable more or less usable

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:54,470
and it wasn't as convenient or

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:58,700
pleasurable or even delightful you know

00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:01,520
the I'm feeling lucky was just at that

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:05,000
little addition which made something

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,880
pleasurable we see it as well with

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,010
MySpace and Facebook

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,710
so both MySpace and Facebook did the

00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,510
same thing you know they allowed you to

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:20,110
connect with your friends and to share

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:22,699
photos and to write little bits of text

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,860
and that's not a typical myspace but

00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,260
that's what myspace could look like it

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:32,210
could look like a complete match and if

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:35,120
we go back we can see that as well as

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,449
being more usable and convenient

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,960
I think Facebook's emphasis on photos

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:44,419
and you know family were the things that

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:52,160
made it meaningful it had personal

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:54,349
significance and then if we move on my

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,890
favorite example WordPress so 10 years

00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,790
ago I was asked by my company at the

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,340
time

00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:06,230
to choose a CMS and I went through ten

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:09,110
different CMS's Drupal mods mod X all

00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,120
they think that WordPress was the one

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,980
that had this five minute install and

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,630
this five minute instable was great you

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:19,160
know like it was the only one of all

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:25,430
these PHP CMS's that was quick and easy

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:26,720
to use and talking more about meaning if

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,260
you go to meetup.com

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,060
this is the message you get what do you

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:38,570
love do more of it with meta so if you

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:41,870
can get to the point of meaning then you

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,960
know you can get to a point of creating

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:48,110
users that come back again and again who

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,320
find pleasure in your site I mean I'm

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,470
very interested in web experiences that

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:59,300
help bring people together and I think

00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:01,430
that is an extra example of meaning and

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,440
so if we're talking about user

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:09,410
experience what I'm going to do now is

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:13,550
present a process so this is what I call

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:16,460
the learning spiral of UX design and the

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,630
idea with this is that we all start from

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:24,320
a position of relative ignorance so no

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:28,300
matter how old our site is we can always

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,760
learn more and with each stage of this

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,860
design process we hope to learn more and

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,630
by learning more we make better

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:42,440
decisions and so we start off with some

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:46,940
goals now these can be anything a goal

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:50,690
could be you know make more sales get

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:53,660
more visitors get more signups to your

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,380
mailing list anything that you can track

00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:00,680
and that you can use as a way of

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,420
focusing your efforts regarding that one

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,310
of getting people signed up to your

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,760
mailing list you have to be very careful

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:11,030
because I mean we're all booked by these

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,980
pop-ups asking people to sign up to the

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,370
mailing list right

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,190
but probably on the data end it works

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,459
you know because people do just type in

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:25,850
email just to get rid of it but how many

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:29,329
people here have just closed down a site

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,779
because they've been so annoyed right so

00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:35,420
virtually everyone in here is the most

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:36,680
annoying thing ever but when you're just

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,300
looking at digits

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,800
you know maybe think oh yeah we've got

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,829
an extra hundred people on the mailing

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:47,480
list a hundred possibly very gullible

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:49,190
people are prepared to endure this I

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,630
mean I didn't know if you see the back

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,889
end of this often you get people

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:57,639
swearing in these lists but yeah you

00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:00,529
also need to track your bounce rate and

00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,980
so once you've established your goals I

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:06,709
think it's helpful to actually get some

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,839
insight into your users or your

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:14,389
potential users you can do this through

00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:18,670
online tools so this is a demographics

00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:21,319
section of Google Analytics this is not

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,940
terribly helpful but you know it does

00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:25,430
give you a little bit of insight and the

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:30,290
type of people that are looking at your

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:34,910
site this one I really like if you go to

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:38,350
you go profiles you can type in any area

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:41,389
of interest and they will use their data

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,930
to give you your kind correlations of

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:48,769
what people who are interested in those

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:53,360
things are like so what we have here

00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:57,170
hopefully is people who enjoy yoga tend

00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,079
to be female they tend to be young they

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:02,300
tend to be fairly well-off and pretty

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,699
left-wing I mean I don't know I think

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,699
like this yeah it's like a communist so

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:17,480
and it also tells us what kind of things

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:20,050
they enjoy in terms of entertainment so

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,860
they like Casper the Friendly Ghost

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,370
Marty fellow and Ken Worley

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,480
I mean

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:32,380
I don't know how they work I mean so you

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,530
know in a way this looks a bit like a

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,750
stereotype I think it's based on about

00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,870
like a sample site so it's only a sample

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:45,050
size 123 maybe not take it too seriously

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:49,520
but maybe you'll find some insight in

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:51,650
there of something that yeah you know

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,980
like maybe yeah this will be something

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:58,550
that you can use in a future marketing

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:02,480
campaign or something like that you can

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:04,970
also do ethnographic research so a

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,360
friend of mine set up this Instagram

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,770
account called receipts from Tesco and

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,130
what she does is she goes to the

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,640
self-service tools at her local kind of

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,870
Tesco

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:21,170
local and she just takes receipts and

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,750
posts at one Instagram as a way of like

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:35,150
getting an insight into what people are

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:37,520
actually like okay and so I mean the

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:41,990
example we saw a bear the person's got

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,070
Red Bull painkillers and chocolate and

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,530
like that's what you know like that's

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:55,420
quite a interesting insight into that

00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:58,130
person's life you can also actually

00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,960
observe people say I mean I really

00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,730
enjoyed Kenda's talk because you know

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,200
we're talking about a system 1 and

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:07,790
system 2 like most of what we actually

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,180
miss right emphasizing to people come

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:13,880
from what they do rather than what they

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:17,570
say we often tell people that we are

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,700
into this that and the other but we can

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,890
you know really judge those by what we

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,530
actually do so if you go into a cafe you

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,410
know maybe you can you know observe in a

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,330
non-creepy way like what people what

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,820
people are the websites are on and what

00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:36,890
you know how they're interacting what

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:39,230
kind of distractions they have and yeah

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:42,590
I think I think you know even talking

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:46,430
to people yeah you know like can be very

00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:48,740
helpful but like I say you know I think

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:53,450
it's often better to observe what people

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,310
do rather than what people say I find

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,320
this really helpful once we've got our

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:01,430
goals business goals

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:05,240
and once we've discussed a user needs we

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,960
get this crossover where your business

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:12,020
goals intersect with your user needs and

00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,790
so the idea is that you know one of your

00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,850
business goals might be to sell

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:19,640
something but that's not necessarily

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:23,660
user need but maybe the user needs

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:26,240
really informative content about in a

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,160
WordPress or whatever and through them

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,280
accessing the thing they need getting

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,280
into your site through Google you can

00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:39,350
kind of push them on to you know hiring

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:41,750
you to help out and so yeah we just go

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,180
back through this learning spiral get

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:49,640
our goals do our research and the next

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:52,070
stage usually is to build a prototype so

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:57,200
the idea is that we want to test our

00:15:52,070 --> 00:16:00,830
idea our thesis as soon as possible

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,720
and there's plenty of kind of

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,080
applications that will help you do this

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,570
this is something called Val Sam ich

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:11,360
which allows you to create a mock-up

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:14,030
that looks it's all done in kind of

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,280
Comic Sans and the idea with this is

00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:19,040
that you're not distracted by the design

00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,070
and you can just focus purely on the

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,900
actions so you might present typical

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,750
user with something like this and then

00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,900
say to them you know can you tell me how

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,880
to edit this page or something like that

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,920
and see how they got on without being

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,360
distracted by the design

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:43,010
there's also Axia which is a bit more

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:47,480
high less like less lo-fi Adobe

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:49,430
experience design envision and the idea

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,820
is at each stage you don't need to worry

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,560
about the

00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,630
you don't worry about the back end you

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,440
can just build something very quickly

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:02,510
test it you can click through this and

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,260
get some insights into how people use it

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,450
but

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,460
WordCamp I would recommend just using a

00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,790
wordpress you know you can go on

00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:17,330
wordpress.com set up your content put a

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,790
few images set up your pages and in what

00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:23,300
two hours you've got a site that is

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:30,800
clickable workable readable and all

00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:34,610
importantly testable so again there's

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,040
tools that will allow you to do testing

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,030
if you haven't got lots of human beings

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,180
near you

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:44,120
usability hub have a whole suite of

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:48,620
things like they do this five-second

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,550
test where they flash up your site for

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,160
five seconds

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,050
and then ask the user you know what is

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,300
this site about you know what is the

00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,410
message of this site and the idea is

00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:03,320
you're tapping into that system one

00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:07,550
thinking they also have a kind of

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,740
comparison test so this is one I did for

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:13,370
city of Glasgow College when they

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:18,680
designed their site and the new site had

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:22,190
a 70% test rate this is not kind of you

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,830
know if not amazing data is not going to

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,800
change the world but it is often helpful

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,680
when you're dealing with a client or

00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,860
helping to inform your decisions to help

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:38,060
make different tests and different

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:41,930
prototypes this is user testing which

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:45,590
alongside what users do they allow you

00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:48,680
to send a site to actual users all

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:51,230
around the world and to get them to use

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,050
it speaking out loud doing the tasks

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,080
that you set them and what they'll send

00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,610
you back is a video and at the end of

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,570
that video they'll do a website

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:05,540
usability test and it's really really

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,650
insightful to get that information to

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,630
see

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:13,340
what people actually do Jakob Nielsen he

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:18,320
he kind of worked out that you only need

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:21,529
about five uses to uncover 80% of your

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,409
usability problems so you don't need to

00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:27,890
test it with thousands of people but you

00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:34,309
can get very good insights with just a

00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:38,870
few people so my wife recently finished

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:41,260
a yoga teacher training course and at

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,299
the end of that course they did a little

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:48,470
marketing segment and they asked people

00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:50,720
to create their own site and so she what

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:53,659
she did she went straight on to work

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,659
fresh calm went through that big list of

00:19:53,659 --> 00:20:00,820
themes and she chose this one

00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:04,460
Karuna which apparently is Sanskrit for

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,020
compassion so you learn something every

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,760
day

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,570
and this Karuna the-- you know it's just

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,419
a free theme from wordpress.com I think

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:17,510
it is actually yeah it's made by

00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:20,870
automatic so you know fairly trustworthy

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:24,700
it should have everything neat it's got

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:28,549
a little kind of lotus flower logo and a

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,100
photo of someone doing yoga but as we

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:33,230
saw earlier you know like just because

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,929
you start with a theme that looks good

00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:39,200
here once you've got your content and

00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:43,279
your own photos often looks very

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:48,140
different and you know one size of fit

00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:50,090
all so this this is what she came up

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,799
with so I mean it didn't take her very

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:56,120
long but this is what she came up with

00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:59,779
and what I did is that I got someone to

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:05,179
test this website I asked them the task

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:07,820
to find out how much yoga class was so

00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:09,649
they went on the homepage got this

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,720
massive advert which is what you get

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:14,600
when you have a free website on

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,980
WordPress com they scanned around the

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,970
homepage see if there's anything on

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:24,350
there eventually clicks on claw

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:28,310
some courses and then kind of scanned

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:30,440
this information and what you'd be doing

00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,240
when you're asking someone to test is to

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,540
speak out loud to ask them what they're

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:40,190
thinking so this person they had that

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:42,530
table up there with the colored units I

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:47,900
don't know if actually I don't know if

00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:50,300
we can kind of rewind but so this table

00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,220
is just an image and they you can see

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,930
them clicking on that clicking can I

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,260
make it bigger because I can't read this

00:21:53,930 --> 00:22:04,040
at the moment then they found this list

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:06,110
of classes and days I mean can anyone

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:19,910
point out any issues with this just

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:28,130
looking at it now too much yeah you know

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:31,150
what sort of scrolling so I got them to

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:33,140
speak out loud as they were doing it

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,270
yeah and I was looking over their

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,140
shoulder so yeah this is one that was

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:46,700
done in real life rather than with the

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:50,180
automated tools so one of the things

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,700
they noticed is that the the yoga studio

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:56,840
is completely empty

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:59,270
like right that's like that's a bad sign

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,840
right like we don't want to practice an

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:05,000
empty yoga studio

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,540
they also yeah pointing out the thing

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,570
about the table which was not clickable

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:18,680
and a bit all over the shop and if you

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:20,990
go down you can see that the prices it's

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,330
like prices for students but you know

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,330
like how are we a student like do you

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,160
have to be a student to get that rate so

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,470
there's lots of confusion we got lots of

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,690
feedback in what like two minutes of

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,190
looking at the site looking at real

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,860
content so

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,920
what I'm going to do is run through some

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,960
heuristics some kind of rules of thumb

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:46,010
five things that we can look for on our

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,410
own sites either when we're just looking

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,860
at what we've got ourselves or when

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,890
we're doing testing because we'll be a

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,470
yogi like there's nothing in here that

00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,720
requires any jargon you don't need to

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,950
know anything about yoga to get started

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:06,560
with this next thing is make sure your

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:10,640
design is purposeful I really love

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,710
dueling goes home screen so simple

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,630
learning language for free forever get

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:20,570
started if we can boil down our USP into

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,920
something that simple then you know

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,730
we're going to make it super easy for

00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,680
our users to get started I mean it does

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,290
you know carry on and you can find out

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,770
more about the subject but you know why

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:36,230
would you need any more it's so simple

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,880
in yoga terms we've got something

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,220
similar experience hot yoga today

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,500
introductory offer very clear

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,680
call-to-action compare that to this one

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,370
Centon

00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:52,910
no real call to action lots of

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:55,250
navigation options doing yoga reiki

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:59,330
Swedish massage it's kind of all over

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,950
the shop coming to this site you can see

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,910
what they're thinking like oh if we

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,010
cover everything

00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:07,250
people will come along they'll do it but

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:11,360
actually you know you may end up just

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:17,900
losing them entirely because what is it

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:22,340
decision fatigue that's all well so I'm

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:24,290
a bit ambivalent about this so I would

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:28,100
say in the first stages follow

00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:32,660
conventions you may have seen this joke

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,420
which is the idea that all websites look

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:39,320
the same that right like we see that

00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:41,270
again and again and again and you can

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,800
understand the thinking that people want

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:47,660
it to be frictionless so here's an

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,929
example of that it's almost exactly the

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,259
same

00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:53,480
right like the three boxes the big

00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,499
call-to-action and the navigation along

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,320
the top

00:25:54,499 --> 00:26:00,350
I think WordPress does a pretty good job

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:05,690
of not making all the themes look like

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:07,129
this but there are plenty that do but

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,720
yeah like I say I think those

00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:14,570
conventions need to be treated carefully

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,570
so it's become a convention recently to

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:21,799
have a hamburger menu everyone's got a

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:23,960
hamburger menu simple it's clean but the

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:28,190
we should test these things Luke

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:31,249
Wroblewski he's a designer he did some

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:34,669
tests with Google Analytics on an app

00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:37,460
that changed from having a three menu

00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:42,309
item just a very simple menu to a

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:45,590
hamburger menu and they lost kind of 40%

00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:50,379
okay so I think I've got an example up

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:54,230
here oh yeah they say hamburger menu

00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:56,629
sorry is those three lines there so this

00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,490
is a good example there's like people at

00:26:56,629 --> 00:27:00,379
a word press conference it don't know a

00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,230
hamburger menu it and lots of people

00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:05,179
won't so it's supposed to be a hamburger

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,639
because it's got a top layer middle

00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:11,450
layer and a bottom layer and all your

00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:13,490
navigation is hidden behind there but if

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,669
you can test these things test it with

00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,369
users let's see if it makes a difference

00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:22,159
if you add the word menu you know like

00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:25,669
maybe that will make it clear enough for

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,019
people that aren't aware of it but yeah

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:28,299
this is what you get when you have

00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:31,249
something that doesn't follow any

00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:32,480
conventions it's a little bit of a mess

00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:37,639
you don't really know where you are

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:41,379
you've got to learn the site every time

00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:44,480
it's not completely frictionless and

00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:47,749
finally clarity again this navigation

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,909
there's a kind of rule that says that

00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:53,539
kind of more than seven bits of

00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:56,480
information on a navigation becomes too

00:27:53,539 --> 00:28:00,710
confusing to choose so if you can kind

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,049
of limit that down it'll often be a lot

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,029
more help

00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:05,940
for four users and to tap into system

00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:10,739
one if you compare these navigation

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:15,330
items this one actually covers you know

00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:21,419
in six in six words what this does in

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:26,909
about twelve so things like you know

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:29,070
like a studio and about you know they

00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:30,809
can easily be put into one and maybe you

00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:35,539
know you can break up the page to make

00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:39,989
that easy of use so this is the before

00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:42,679
we gave the usability testing and this

00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:45,769
is after so it haven't changed radically

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:49,739
the different simplified a little bit

00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:52,529
the navigation items I think I should I

00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:54,269
should say the goal of this site is not

00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:57,480
to kind of take over the world it's just

00:28:54,269 --> 00:29:04,519
to establish herself as a yoga teacher

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:07,889
and yeah yes he was very appreciative so

00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:10,169
hopefully these kind of ideas this kind

00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:12,859
of awareness of what's going on when

00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:16,289
people are visiting your site actual

00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:18,570
testing with human beings is something

00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:22,289
that you can all actually go home and

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:27,529
use even if you're just downloading

00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:40,769
themes from the WordPress theme library

00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:54,929
any questions what what have you got in

00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:56,789
your menu then what's the I think you've

00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:59,730
got more problems than the drop-down yes

00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:04,080
it's like a relationship with the client

00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:06,899
where you've got to I mean you can use

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,909
data you know like do an a/b testing

00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:13,740
maybe and see which one leads to more

00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,710
conversions or clicks or something like

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,200
that

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,370
that's one way around it but yeah

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,160
usability testing if you can test both

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,440
then you can arm yourself with data

00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:43,000
because otherwise design just becomes a

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:45,550
matter of opinion yeah yeah I mean yeah

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,670
absolutely I mean I think over 50% of

00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:52,360
visits um you know at least all the

00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:54,900
websites I made make our visits from a

00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,900
mobile phone

00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:20,710
absolutely but yeah I mean I think a

00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,210
journey as well so you may start with a

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,790
free site but it's quite easy to

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:27,430
transfer all of that content into a

00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:30,160
self-hosted solution and you know people

00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:32,530
might get more into customizing the site

00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,980
I guess what I'm trying to emphasize is

00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:38,740
that improving your design doesn't mean

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,870
adding a lot of plugins doesn't mean

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,660
adding sliders it could often just be

00:31:40,870 --> 00:32:01,840
taking away stuff and focusing on what

00:31:43,660 --> 00:32:03,520
your user needs are okay if that's a

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,760
good that's a good question I mean if

00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:11,070
you can have your own photos and ideally

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,350
do you use them I think especially

00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:16,000
because people become clued in I guess

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,670
it depends how kind of clued in your

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,840
users are if that photo is seen in

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:26,920
multiple places you may end up being

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,010
associated with other people but yeah

00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,980
it's a good question of

00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:33,970
whether is better to have a great photo

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:38,120
that's a stock photo or a mediocre

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:40,090
authentic photo I mean I would strongly

00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,910
recommend getting professional

00:32:40,090 --> 00:33:53,419
photography can make a huge difference

00:32:42,910 --> 00:33:55,419
to your site do you have an example yeah

00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:57,710
I think if you could get a room together

00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:00,530
everyone in the same room so you know

00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,630
they're all working at the same time I

00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:07,010
think especially there's lots of

00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:13,490
community groups in Scotland so I've

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:15,830
done some testing on a website in

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:18,550
Renfrew sure which is providing advice

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:21,220
to people and we just got everyone on

00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:24,950
around the table all using the sites

00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,780
independently but just it is very

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,919
comfortable situation for people to

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,470
speak out loud

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:35,590
and to talk to each other whilst they

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:35,590
were testing so and I think yeah

00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:26,040
yeah I mean I think if you could get

00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,960
that number of people using something

00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:32,190
that they're not already using like if

00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,320
the if the thing you're offering is

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,810
appealing enough that people will use it

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,690
because it's very difficult to get

00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:42,840
people to change their habits anyway and

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,940
to do something new but yeah I would

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:50,520
just try and get as many people as early

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:53,010
as possible to use it because yeah I

00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,950
mean I know like people set up a Minimum

00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:58,140
Viable Product just using Facebook right

00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,480
like they didn't even they just created

00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,180
a group and got people to post every day

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,550
like how much exercise they're doing how

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:12,270
many calories they post they consumed it

00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:16,040
was like a testing for an app for like

00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:18,750
weight loss whatever and you know it was

00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,380
impossible to get people using it for

00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,840
more than a week

00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:26,400
they've got bored or you know like it

00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:28,410
became in a form of shame or

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,940
embarrassment like maybe oh we haven't

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,400
done as well as we did in the first few

00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,280
day there's like that kind of New Year's

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,640
resolution syndrome where you give up

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,140
after a little while so yeah I mean

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,470
without seeing it I would I would

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,710
suggest just open it up and I don't know

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:48,900
maybe what Ken that was saying about

00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:53,270
giving it value so yeah maybe the way

00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:55,250
you frame that offer that introduct

00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:57,260
you know as a big discount or something

00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,299
to present it as something that people

00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,660
will want to carry on using they're

00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:09,740
getting a lot of email like thousands of

00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:10,130

there is one absolutely absolutely and

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,599

00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:51,170

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,660
