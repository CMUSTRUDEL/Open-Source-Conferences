Description: 
	With ‘only’ 56,000 plugins to choose from, how hard can it be to choose the right plugin for your WP project?
There is no magic button to press, no silver bullet.
But there are some basic tips you can follow that will help you decide if a plugin is going to actually do what it promises.
This talk is designed to walk you through the process and make your decision-making process much, much easier.

okay Jeremy thank you very much so yes

00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:13,840
say that give me a thing to walk up and

00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,309
down on which is written I might attempt

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,189
to do that or practicing my cutting

00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:20,470
skills I'm not sure which and I've never

00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:21,369
been captioned before so the temptation

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,680
to use words like

00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,680
antidisestablishmentarianism justice if

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,699
real oh okay so how do how the heck do I

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,859
choose a plug-in I was really tempted to

00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:38,350
call it something else but heck is

00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,909
fairly close to what I was thinking and

00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,289
you can put the emphasis where you like

00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:49,899
really it's a pain but just by briefly

00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:51,699
who the heck am i yes - boy - for three

00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:53,859
years I spent being something called a

00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,929
Solutions Architect and there's a whole

00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:57,969
team of us and if any of you idea what

00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:59,789
what one of those is please let me know

00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,079
because we never worked at what it was

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,330
although we didn't know we did manage to

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,590
hack piss off the all the architects in

00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,820
the department next door because it's

00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,010
been eight years becoming an architect

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,830
and because we're IT we just call

00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,690
ourselves architect which is fine most

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,330
of that time I was with baa the airport

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,860
company working on flight information

00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,990
systems which is brilliant and

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,850
fascinating and working on Oracle

00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,910
financials which I really really don't

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,800
probably do so any accountants out there

00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,440
I've been doing my own thing since 2012

00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,410
and yeah play tennis I sing when I talk

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,650
which means I don't blog really um so

00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:38,800
that's basically what I do so what is a

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:42,220
plugin hopefully most of you aware and

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,220
that's WB beginners definition of what a

00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,320
plug-in is don't need to pay notes on it

00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,810
it's not very exciting I would point out

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,510
the words integrate seamlessly at the

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,750
bottom I be tempted to put the word

00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,510
should before that because they don't

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:09,819
always obviously that's part of the fun

00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:12,939
but let's go so yes the the far more

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:15,129
basic than that kind of definition is is

00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:16,569
this well actually the plug-in if

00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,830
looking at the bottom there is a plug-in

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,400
is what your site

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,080
does now she's a hugely over-simplistic

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,670
split of the two but the theme is about

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,550
your design in your layout and your

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,960
colors and all the rest of it and plug

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,680
in is the bells and whistles and all the

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,690
sexy stuff

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,640
now I'm sure lots of 2015 developers

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,260
would argue otherwise and yes there's

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,740
lots of themes that do clever stuff as

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,960
well but again an overly simplistic view

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,470
but the point is at some point you will

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,960
have to choose a plug-in so I'm not

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,780
offering the definitive solution to

00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,440
choosing a plug-in this is a way it's

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,510
not the way so it's our stress again

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,709
this is my get out drawers this is

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,810
simplistic its generalized and these are

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,030
not rules this is just guidelines in the

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,540
way I've found it my experience in

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,490
WordPress as I said in my intro was just

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,130
kicking the buttons until it did as its

00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,220
told or till I found out what the hell

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,110
about that button did and I'm not

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,420
offering a silver bullet a solution to

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,490
everything you're still going to have to

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,170
put the hard yards in you it takes some

00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,840
works it takes some effort and take some

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:30,820
time to find yourself a plug-in that

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,010
does what you wanted to do so 55,000

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,580
plus plugins I know I haven't looked at

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,050
them all in fact that was what it was

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,840
last week

00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,160
I think it's checked about an hour ago

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,470
was fifty five thousand eight hundred

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,180
and forty now and I was overlooking

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:50,230
another one appeared so there's there's

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,850
new ones coming on all the time so the

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,860
question is where do you go to find

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,750
these to your plugins well no big

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,870
surprise there wordpress.org is the

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,790
place to look

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,480
wordpress.org slash plugins is where you

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:07,209
will find the bulk but before you jump

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,260
in and start searching like crazy and so

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,630
on so forth you need to think about what

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,690
it is you're actually going to do with

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,780
this year plug-in so you need to think

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,780
and decide for yourself what you need a

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,790
plug-in to do it sounds simple but it's

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,440
very easy just to leap in there and

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,470
actually find something that looks like

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,110
it might be and set yourself up in

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,590
totally wrong direction

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,060
so make a list it sounds against sounds

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,310
dead straightforward but make a list of

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,569
what you need plug-in to do for you what

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,729
you were looking for functionality

00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,090
you're looking for and then expand the

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:49,080
list and try some different terminology

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:52,319
because like any search routine they're

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,479
not perfect and you will find different

00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,020
terms come up with very similar terms

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,870
will come up with different answers and

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,639
once you've done that and you've got a

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,550
list of terms divide that list or

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,280
defined a list of what you've got to do

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,050
you've got must have fine you've got

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,969
nice to have and you've got what I like

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,330
to call Widnes which so there wouldn't

00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:17,580
it be nice if okay now wouldn't it be

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,469
nice if tend not to come from you if

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,229
you're if you're putting a website

00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:24,810
together for a client or a friend or a

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:27,150
group or whatever they're there the

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,629
really good ideas that tend to come up

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:34,139
about between 24 and 48 hours before the

00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:36,529
things going live and some bright sparks

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,690
is all and you know what's coming

00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:42,900
because they say nice if it did this and

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,879
go yes it would and if you'd asked me

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,129
about three months ago we could have

00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,770
maybe done something about it but now's

00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:52,169
not a good time but if you can actually

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,319
try to preempt those and if it's a case

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,610
of going through with the client or with

00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,349
yourself or your group you're working

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,990
with and so on and actually trying to

00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:03,360
identify those things you'll find some

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,710
of those things on the wouldn't be nice

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,120
if and you know it takes a bit of actual

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,339
thinking it takes a bit of thinking

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,620
around talking around the subject but

00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,089
some of those things will be yeah

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,469
actually that's something we could

00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:15,360
really really do with and it might

00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:18,349
actually just still steer your search

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,650
lightly but be prepared to compromise

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:24,379
yes wouldn't it be nice if so lovely but

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,719
maybe that's the phase 2 of the project

00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,789
or phase 3 or whatever and particularly

00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:31,199
if you're getting paid for it that's

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,529
really nice because it actually gives

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,759
you a route to take so you can say yeah

00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:37,710
we'll get you up and running we'll get

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,270
you live we'll get you going with the

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,819
basics with the straightforward stuff

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,380
you wanted but we'll come back to that

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,729
because that's a really nice idea and

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,819
maybe when the things establish

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:49,740
we'll build we'll build the project or

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,029
we'll make it we'll make a Phase two

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:58,439
so don't do you sell family a few

00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:59,909
another stage three the project so okay

00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,240
you come up with a list of what you

00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:06,180
actually want to happen now where do I

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,189
look okay we mentioned wordpress.org so

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,650
I'm waving my hands around hand in the

00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:15,240
pocket we mentioned wordpress.org and

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:19,319
wordpress.org is a list as I said at

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,270
55,000 plus plugins great however

00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,029
there's plenty of people out there who

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:29,759
are prepared to give you a list of the

00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:30,960
10 best plug-ins for something all the

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,830
this one down here

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,330
beginners 124 must have WordPress

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,529
plugins for business websites now

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,629
they're chucking these things out all

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,889
the time and they're great because they

00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,479
can actually do some of the filtering

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,399
for you because they they'll have

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,740
chucked out some of the rubbish which is

00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,270
always helpful and B if you've got a

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,800
particular area you're looking for that

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,969
might actually give you a focus and give

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,669
you some ideas of what some some plugins

00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:58,889
might do and might not which is great

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,959
but bear in mind some of these or both

00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,810
of these are commercial organizations as

00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,060
well now if there's anybody here from

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,969
those organizations as prepared to tell

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,899
me it's not the case on books I

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:15,479
alone I'm quite prepared to be told it's

00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,099
not the case but there are vested

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,680
interests at work here so there may be

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:22,559
sponsorships and there may be I'm

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,289
guessing come it's pure guess don't take

00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:28,649
me on that as a quote I really don't

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:30,330
know but they're there for purpose they

00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,979
can be really useful in giving you some

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,819
guy cutting up some pointers as to where

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:40,289
you might go but just bear that in mind

00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:41,519
so well what do I search for okay well

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,959
I'm going to go back to the wordpress

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,630
store or you might have filtered down

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,910
your list a little bit but you're going

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:52,139
to wordpress.org slash plugins and you

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,510
type in a term or a word now put into

00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:58,970
turmeric key word and so on so forth

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,970
and look for clues in the first answer

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:06,770
and try synonyms if you don't take take

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:10,290
you takes you there way to go

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:12,000
take for example start with general took

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,650
very general terms if you if you really

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,110
thought through this sort of clued up

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,710
because you don't know necessarily the

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,600
terms that are the the in words or their

00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,760
jargon terms that may be used for the

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,650
area you're used for so a lot of people

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,020
search for example forms because lots of

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,520
lots of websites need forms and very

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,620
quickly you find that actually a lot of

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,640
them are split into into contact forms

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,170
and other forms so find synonyms and

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,020
actually trying to focus in your search

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,930
it's logical but it's it's a thing to do

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,670
I would also suggest particularly if

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,490
you're going back to revisit and do

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,680
other other sites in the future it

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,840
sounds totally nerdy and and then bit

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,230
OCD but take a note of the terms you

00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:02,250
used because occasionally it floats

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,200
across your eyeline or there's a plugin

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,660
I might use I might not use it for this

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,030
project but I actually might need what

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,040
might need it later on and six months

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,960
later you can spend 80s going now what

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,540
the hell term wasn't looking for and I

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,320
remember looking like saw some and and

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,450
you've done or where the hell you're

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,330
looking so it's worth taking a notice

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,920
it's a it's a bit a nerdy and it's a bit

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,120
hailing if you like but it it is if is

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,250
effective you can actually go back and

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,990
are well I actually looked up contact

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,350
forms that gave me such and such and

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:35,460
going somewhere to go so look what types

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:38,490
what types of plugins that we got the

00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,350
vast majority of that's not affair a lot

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,070
of the plugins you'll see on

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:46,230
wordpress.org are free plugins great but

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,540
they tend to be light versions why they

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,230
liked versions well they have some of

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,050
the functionality you need and if you've

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,580
got a very simple sites and some very

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,650
straightforward ideas that might be all

00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,790
you ever need good on you well done

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,270
great

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,250
highly recommended it's free why not

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,450
however you do see in the reviews some

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,500
of the people say happen they just

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,600
they've done all this thing it doesn't

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,640
do all the things I will need it to well

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,660
yes because people have invested a lot

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,819
of time and developing

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,550
these things they obviously want you to

00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:20,009
know some of them not go by donations

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,769
and so on and so forth but some people

00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:25,649
have got a living to make so there are

00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:30,689
premium versions or the pro you'll often

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:33,259
find something like contact forms has a

00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:35,639
like version but also has a pro version

00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,579
so I use something called calculated

00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,009
field form because it allows me to or

00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:43,110
for one site idea it allowed me to do

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,990
spreadsheet style stuff with like a

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,300
pickup feels and I can actually do

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,509
raisins and functions between fields and

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,129
so on and so forth which was quite fun

00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:57,089
and I had a mortgage calculator and all

00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:58,829
sorts of things built into it and it was

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,000
quite fun to use and that's okay I paid

00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,339
a premium for it that was a one-off

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,540
payment some of the other ones some of

00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,199
the particularly popular ones like

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,939
gravity forms it's a subscription and

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:11,730
you can be paying for one site you can

00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:13,050
contain 59 dollars a year for that but

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:17,279
if that's what you need you better pay

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:20,160
$59 great don't know you can't do the

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,600
whole thing for free necessarily so

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,970
there's subscription ones and then you

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,639
have things like will kind of said

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:30,509
WooCommerce which is a freemium site

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,779
freemium site is one where the basic

00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:35,850
plug-in is free but there are hundreds

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,680
possibly thousands of other plugins that

00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,829
have been built that and attached to

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,100
WooCommerce around it which are payment

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:45,959
once so you basic stuff you get free but

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:52,610
all the add-on stuff so it's a plug-in

00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:56,100
for a plug-in if you like bless you is a

00:12:52,610 --> 00:13:03,660
is extra so those are sort of types of

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:08,670
plugins you can get so how do I choose a

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,370
good'n well cheapest advice you can get

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,259
this word-of-mouth and somewhere like

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,439
this is a great way a great place to do

00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:21,779
it so the word camps go to meetups they

00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:24,480
number has a meetup might have something

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,900
to do with and forums and blogs and so

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,680
on great way to pick up

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,930
free advice I'm personally very cheap

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,720
I'm yours for a hot chocolate and a

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,720
blueberry muffin

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,730
as you can tell however don't take this

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,390
you know some people are trying to earn

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:49,120
a living so that advice though may come

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:51,250
with some caveats but equally there some

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,870
of that advice might be skewed slightly

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,550
because if their personal tax you

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,400
develop the plug-in that might be the

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,580
one they're pushing but you know it's do

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:04,570
all these things it's a balance the

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:07,750
other thing is if you're going to have a

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,260
look at the search on WordPress at all

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,760
this is a sort of response you get

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,470
you're going to things to bear in mind

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,840
the things to look at how many times has

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,210
been downloaded has it been now and only

00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,170
twice so has it we've downloaded

00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,970
gazillions of times because that might

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,950
be a clue as to whether it's any good

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,720
and also with how popular it is now if

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,930
it's brand new not obviously might be

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,510
very few but this compressed JPEG wanted

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,370
one I've used a couple of times it's got

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,520
a hundred thousand plus installs great

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,530
well that sounds promising now next to

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,010
it right now the picture is smush which

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,690
has over a million just as it happened

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,540
that didn't suit my particular

00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,830
circumstances that one did but the fact

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,630
he's got a hundred thousand plus was a

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:54,720
good start how recently updated and what

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:58,740
the forums and reviews say about it well

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,330
this is that compressed JPEG one again

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,370
last updated nine hours ago well that's

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,240
promising

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,800
might be that there was something

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,900
fundamentally wrong with it and they've

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,420
updated it but it's actually tested up

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,580
to five point zero so that WordPress 5.0

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,100
that's encouraging they're reasonably up

00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,950
to speed now if it hasn't been updated

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,080
for eighteen months or a couple of years

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:22,750
you start thinking is that because it's

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,120
so rock-solid that it's brilliant or is

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,290
it because developers just probably fed

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,200
up that's gone on done something else

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,930
and every used with lost interest so

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,190
might work perfectly well but if you do

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,040
have a problem you might not get the

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:40,509
support you're perhaps hoping for

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,800
and the other placed of course is the

00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,970
other thing you might want to look at is

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:49,540
the reviews

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:51,190
oh the reviews what joy so here you are

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,829
yes yeah I'm looking at I'm interested

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,959
in the five-star reviews this one has 97

00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:58,209
five-star reviews and you have things

00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:00,009
like fantastic good plugin very useful

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,600
plugin amazing plugin and great support

00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,389
why it's all kind of encouraging that's

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,149
good good news and certainly for those

00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:10,389
of you in the last last talk that Claire

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:12,329
did compared to their the ratios of 5

00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:15,009
stars to 1 stars with that peopleburg

00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:18,430
example she gave I'd say that's that's

00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:22,060
looking quite promising probably five

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:25,930
star reviews is yeah most of them very

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,180
useful so that third one down excellent

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,639
not stingy on free version compress

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,319
about a thousand images monthly yeah but

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,759
if that's what I want you that's that's

00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:35,430
pretty much answered my question that's

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,540
that's a good sign

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:41,529
hey it's telling me out to the free

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,470
level and B that's all that's all I'm

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:47,110
really interested in it doing result

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,790
however I find this happens with more

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,329
with themes and with plugins right

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:55,510
enough themes tear off it seems in

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:59,949
particular five star reviews tend to be

00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:02,740
written by the developers mum and the

00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:04,419
granny Antonelli and whatever because

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,270
they've said just give me a five star

00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:10,900
review rated and the developers love

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:14,230
five star reviews for you maybe not so

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,860
useful because they tend to be fairly

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:19,150
straightforward fantastic rate which is

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,350
fantastic and great but doesn't really

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,770
tell you a great deal about it so I've

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:26,260
got a preference for four star reviews

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:30,730
because I'm weird like that but the

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:35,190
great thing is that word but they tend

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:38,409
to come with it is a great plugin but so

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,790
this one says great only missing mobile

00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,070
apps integration well if that's the bit

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,929
you're looking for you know perhaps that

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,880
puts it puts a flag up and perhaps

00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,980
that's where I'm going to find a problem

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,180
so it's worth looking at the four star

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,560
reviews because they

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:56,290
to be I find a little more objective so

00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,570
you might get a slightly more you know I

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,520
say intelligent kind of thing about you

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:05,980
know a bit more thought through type of

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:09,370
response this as an example also has two

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,950
replies to it this particular one so I

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,290
looked at what the replies were so Rick

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,510
Ricard asked about this mobile apps and

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:20,950
the author time PNG came back

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:23,440
specifically with an answer and OB it

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,290
was a couple of years ago it came on

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,870
says so firstly he raised a concern and

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,450
if the develop could come back with an

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,010
answer understand the solution and under

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,590
further underneath there the card

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,230
himself had come back and said tiny PNG

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,670
rocks which IRA tells me he's terribly

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:45,580
cruel or is about twelve not for which

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,950
language but anyway that's encouraging

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,330
that's a sign of things to come down the

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,610
converse of that of course is the one

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:55,680
star reviews when you get quality stuff

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:58,210
like it's absolute shite which again I

00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,670
find one-star reviews tend to be written

00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,720
about 2:00 in the morning because they

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,210
tend to be written when you've had a

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,670
really bad day it's not done what you

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,380
wanted to do the support guys not come

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,080
back and give me any help whatsoever I

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,580
think it's really really hacked off and

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,360
you had out it's just the end of a bad

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:19,780
day in a fit of fury you hammer down on

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,430
the keys just like one start so you tend

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,850
to get very emotive type stuff in

00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:28,600
one-star reviews so review is very

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,460
useful but no seek a balanced look for

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,570
objective kind of responses and it might

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,930
give you some of those stuff you're

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:37,000
looking for a word of warning what you

00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,740
regard as a five star four star or

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,870
whatever ain't necessarily what the

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:46,360
other guy considers to be a five star

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:49,810
four star exhibit number one this is one

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,390
for ad Club which is her and add adverse

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,640
events description thing he's only got

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,710
two four star reviews

00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,370
hey exactly what I needed will be this

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,390
plug-in sucks and they're both four

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,540
stars go figure

00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:07,990
I have no idea but so bear that in mind

00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:10,180
now the dates are a bit slightly but why

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,160
the kindly aren't put four stars and

00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,190
then say this plug-in sucks okay

00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,070
that's his problem so nobody's perfect

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:21,550
so take him as you will that's what

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:23,500
review that's what reviews do okay

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:28,830
so I've chosen the plug-in I want what

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:32,020
do I do now installing word of warning

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,120
makeup right done this and may have made

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,670
a mistake when you install a plug-in

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,890
make a note of which version is and when

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,800
you installed it because it doesn't

00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,510
matter how much testing you do there's a

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,980
possibility that's there's a conflict

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,480
somewhere or something doesn't quite

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,570
work the way you expect it to and

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,770
whatever and I don't know how I don't

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,770
care how brilliant you are

00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:57,100
how much time you can devote to your

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:59,890
precious website you can't test you can

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:04,060
modify that you can't you seldom can

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:06,340
test everything and chances are your

00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,970
user or your still your customer comes

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:12,040
back two months later and says you know

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,360
last couple of months if this fitting

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,820
this funny thing it does this and it

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,470
does this in your home since when

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,550
oh I don't know it's in the last couple

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,530
of months or couple weeks or whatever

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,030
you go okay you go back and find that's

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,330
the time you take you updated that plug

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,190
in maybe test that thing and try again

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,460
with a previous version and final yeah

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,820
actually it that's when it started going

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,030
well and you've you've missed it so note

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:42,040
the date and motion number and keep a

00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:43,510
copy of the version get the easiest way

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,420
to do that is rather than installing

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,660
your work your plug-in directly from the

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,360
website download it to your own PC or

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:55,210
Mac first and then upload it from your

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,620
machine onto them onto the website only

00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,820
means you've got your own personal copy

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:03,010
of that version again bit nerdy that

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,990
anal take that what she will but it

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,910
means you've got a copy and if you it

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,980
might be easier to find that copy of the

00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,320
old the previous version then it is

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,809
going back to the developer and trying

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,679
to track through there

00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:18,840
however efficient or not there their

00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:23,629
site is to find a previous version and

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:26,159
get it back but before you go whoa

00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:29,309
ruffling and with a with the plugin you

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,200
do need to test it because it doesn't

00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:35,100
matter who you spoke to a work camp

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,740
which review you read which forum you

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,379
went on and so on so forth does it do

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,749
the thing you want it to do because the

00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:45,990
chances are your requirements are

00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:48,059
slightly different to anyone else who's

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,100
used to use the plugin and obviously the

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:54,289
more esoteric we get the more particular

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,399
that might be so have you tested it well

00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,840
easiest place to test it is on the site

00:22:56,399 --> 00:23:01,649
itself and of course if you're not lied

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,269
yet that that might be ideal because at

00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:05,009
least you can test it in the environment

00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,710
it's within which it's going to live but

00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,690
pick your moment because if your users

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,659
or your customers testing at the same

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,730
time you might be a bit disconcerting

00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:18,480
things are changing now as easy as that

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:20,940
as they're using it and that goes to

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,649
some extent for for live sites as well

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,759
eventually you've got to put it on your

00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:29,429
live site test it that's why site

00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,570
designers tend to be working into stupid

00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,649
hours of the morning because they're

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,679
hoping no one else is looking at the

00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:36,720
site itself however if you can't use the

00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,139
site itself check a staging site does

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,869
your host provide a staging site 34s be

00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:46,080
who is standing out there provide a free

00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:48,090
staging site and sign up with them site

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,999
ground who's another big hosting company

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:54,440
they do the same thing very very useful

00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:58,799
take an instant copy of your website and

00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,690
you've really got a an exact copy that

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,399
you can practice and beats up the hell

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,440
you know people add all the stuff you

00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:08,580
like into it hopefully without anyone

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,960
else being able to see it the other

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,340
thing to do is to set it up on your own

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:17,999
to set up the website on your own

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:19,409
machine there's a system called local by

00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,750
flywheel which is very straightforward

00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:23,730
for setting up your own basically

00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,240
virtual machine on your own PC or Mac

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:28,279
and basically sets up

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,499
your own copy of sight and you could get

00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:31,700
no no way anyone's gonna see that

00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,470
because it's only existing and your

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,869
machine anyway great way to try things

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,119
out they're slightly more complicated

00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:42,350
but basically the same deal wampum

00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:47,690
anthems amp that's basically Windows Mac

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:49,490
and the other one shows my technical

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,159
prowess sir

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,610
but basically o's are again virtual

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:59,659
machines allow you to set up your own

00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:02,059
your own environment so you've got it up

00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:04,580
you've got it running brilliant one of

00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:07,340
the questions you get regularly talked

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,440
about I can't get asked as regular

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:14,509
debate amount is how many plugins is too

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,159
many plugins for my website and my

00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:20,570
general principle would be keep it lean

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,309
and mean but depending on how big and

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,259
complex your site is pending on how many

00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,269
of you know how many plugins you're

00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:28,039
gonna you're gonna require if you take a

00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:29,330
very simple theme it might be that you

00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:33,919
need lots of plugins to get it through

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:36,559
all the sexy stuff you want to do but if

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,159
you're looking to do that it's worth

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:44,690
continuing to test your plugins because

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:47,419
if you stop using them you you need to

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,700
deactivate and delete them so if you've

00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:54,529
got an option to take a plug plug in out

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:56,450
do so just be careful to remember what

00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,360
did he actually does because you might

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,740
find that something some other element

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,419
of it you'd forgotten all about it it

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,629
doesn't suddenly it's gone out of the

00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:07,009
sign but because you're good folk can

00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:14,409
test all your stuff then you'll spot

00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:14,409
that a little more so you'll be fine so

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,869
yeah there's lots of people with an

00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,730
awful lot of plugins on their website if

00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:24,590
it works and it's not causing the grief

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,230
there's actually nothing wrong with it

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:31,639
but just for the sake of it for your own

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:33,529
peace of mind and ability to get get to

00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:35,529
bed before midnight then keeping it lean

00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:39,610
and mean this make that make sense and

00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:43,130
finally do back it up before you start

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:46,100
updating everything I know it's a bore I

00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:48,080
know it takes ages and depending on the

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,840
size a website can be crushing you down

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,450
but I know through painful experience if

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,710
you don't act as an athlete some late

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:59,870
nights so yeah there's thousands of no

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,310
there's lots of options for backing up

00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,440
there's lots of plugins that help you

00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:06,110
back up things like cloud fair seems

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,840
like volt press many others are

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,670
available check on wordpress.org but do

00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,050
make it back up because it doesn't half

00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,600
make life easier particularly if

00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,600
someone's paid you through privilege

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,680
they kind of assume that's their and

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,580
rebuilding the site from scratch when

00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,080
you've rebuilding the shape of the site

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,670
isn't bad trying to remember what

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,020
content they've given news can be more

00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:35,500
of a challenge and finally finally made

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:39,230
your choice relax well for a bit anyway

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,690
but you need to keep alert you need to

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,060
keep testing there's lots of other

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:47,390
changes going on your site is never

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:50,810
finished for one thing it can always be

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:55,430
better but also there's other stuff

00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:59,290
happening WordPress is continually

00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:01,340
making changes for security reasons and

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:04,640
little things like Gutenberg coming

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,430
along just to make life interesting but

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,620
your theme gets updated and your and

00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:12,290
plugins both the one you just put in and

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,300
all the other ones tend to get updated

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:18,950
too so you need to check keep and keep

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:21,350
your eyes open and check those and

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,960
that's really all I have to say thank

00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:28,150
you for this

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:30,770
[Applause]

00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:34,870
okay thanks very much Jeremy they don't

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,870
get any questions yep

00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,850
it's good question I'm sufficiently

00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,650
paranoid that I would I would sooner do

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:56,680
it myself

00:28:50,650 --> 00:29:01,210
but I've still got the time and

00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:06,590
sufficiently few websites that I can

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:09,260
have the luxury of doing that the danger

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,420
of letting the host do it is that they

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,750
apply to things like WordPress updates

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:17,600
and so on let me just throw those in so

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:21,320
long as they let you know it's happening

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,520
that kind of helps because it's kind of

00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,590
embarrassing and particular if you're

00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,090
taking money for the privilege when your

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,940
client rings up and says boom you know

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,370
the site's down don't you then you don't

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,740
[Music]

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,820
so practice your of course I know it's

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,130
down I'm working on it right now

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,730
responds that's kind of that can be kind

00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:42,230
of useful and I was hoping you'd notice

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,270
that just to check that you're keeping

00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:47,060
an eye on it all that is kind of useful

00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:49,460
but personally I would I like to do it

00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,610
myself I like that level of control and

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:56,270
I like this I like the element that says

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:59,990
I decide when it it goes live or I will

00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:01,880
agree with my customer customers when it

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,200
goes live because it makes it look like

00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:18,980
I'm in charge and I know what I'm doing

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:20,960
which is always useful well yeah there's

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,580
there's an old IT adage which is you

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,830
never go for the point 0 of anything

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:28,840
whether it's an operating system or a

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:32,720
theme or anything and I must admit

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,760
personally 5.0 we have sounds terribly

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,410
exciting but doesn't really fill me with

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,290
a great great great deal of confidence

00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,860
right now

00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:43,080
just wait a little bit unless they're

00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,330
going to make radical radical changes or

00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,390
there's something radical on the

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,340
security side of things my temptation

00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,930
would be if just wait let someone else

00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,640
take the steam other than that and the

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,760
hassle

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,620
before I jump in there but I shall be

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,710
testing 5.0 when I will be doing on

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,900
staging site roughly we with sandbags

00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:12,390
built up behind aside and will it impact

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:13,590
on oh yeah yeah I guess from a plugin

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,980
because he tend to be sort of developed

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:20,160
by much smaller organizations deciding

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,560
to go from version one point seven point

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,760
two seven point twelve point three to

00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,230
one point two or two point zero okay

00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,280
what a big changes they just changed the

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,070
numbers for the hell of it because they

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,500
run out or it's hard it's sometimes hard

00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,850
to tell but occasionally I mean jetpack

00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,140
was famous at a famous one obviously

00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:42,900
jetpack massively used had a terrible

00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,490
reputation at one stage because it had

00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,520
been built once and then had umpteen

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,670
things built onto the side of it and

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,080
it's just big cumbersome massive

00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:54,030
whatever and I challenge someone

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,560
automatically it's this terrible low

00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,910
thing and they said well no actually we

00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,520
did we build it from scratch and it's

00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,930
actually a lot slicker now and I do and

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,680
I do use it now so I'm the kind of a

00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:06,890
kind of a convert I say kind of because

00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,450
I haven't found out all he does yet so

00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm still learning on that one but that

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,790
one was one that actually said no we're

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,350
going to go for a whole new version and

00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,980
we just rip the whole thing down and

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,980
built it up again

00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:42,779
yeah that's that's that's kind of a sort

00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:45,929
of thing that keeps you awake at night

00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:46,919
isn't it it's it's there was one and I'm

00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:51,480
now desperately trying to member what

00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:53,880
it's called it was built it was

00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:59,190
developed in Australia and basically

00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:01,080
it's it was one of the first plugins I'd

00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,309
seen and it wasn't wasn't very

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,870
particularly clever one and it certainly

00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:05,909
wasn't the one I was I was reliant on

00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:07,230
but it was kind of I thought it was

00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:08,759
quite good in terms of building and it

00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,059
was it was called something like laid

00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,289
white label and all it did was when you

00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,480
go through a login screen rather than

00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:16,830
just timing the regular WP logging it

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,929
had to be it could you put your own logo

00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,250
or the logo for the company on it which

00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:23,549
when I put it in the customer and all

00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:26,490
about my logo that's kind of useful and

00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:27,960
it it stopped and and stopped being

00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,279
supportive and so on and so forth and I

00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,480
resisted the point of going I need to

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,419
scratch around and find something else

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,740
and start that search process again when

00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,779
actually another company picked it up

00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,200
and took on the sport which was like

00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:41,909
yeah ok type touch words and that's just

00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,429
kind of close as it's got but you're

00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:46,980
right occasionally stuck something that

00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:51,330
you regard as key to your site and the

00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,730
way things work just the developer loses

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:55,320
interest now if you're lucky he tells

00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,149
you is lost he or she tells you they

00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,620
lost interest and say look forget it I'm

00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,090
not gonna be around I'm not gonna answer

00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,610
your questions anymore I've gone and got

00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,440
to do something else if you're unlucky

00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,409
they just leave it and I think just

00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,730
drifts off into the ether so you do have

00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:12,990
to kind of keep an eye on these things

00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:14,909
and the chances are you seldom have to

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,290
reinvent wheels apologies to developers

00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:19,079
out there I'm not a developer as you

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:22,010
might have gathered you know chances are

00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:24,450
somebody's done the thing you want to do

00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,099
something with some for now it might be

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,349
tacked on to a few other things and

00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:30,179
might have to adjust a little bit but

00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:31,470
the chances are that there's something

00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,849
out there that does something pretty

00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,139
damn close to what you were doing before

00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:38,990
so there are there's usually

00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,990
alternatives yes sir

00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:57,630
yeah I the worst I've come across

00:34:54,870 --> 00:35:04,110
somebody cheerfully said to me I've got

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:06,030
72 online which seemed a lot if it if

00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:09,420
it's doing what you wanted to do and

00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:11,280
it's not crawling like a snail and it's

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,480
not keeping you awake at night because

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,990
one's getting in the way or the other

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,930
one

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:20,070
I'm tend to say yeah that's fine I'm

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:21,210
sure you could pare it down with some

00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,880
effort but if but if it's if it's

00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:32,670
actually doing what it needs to do I

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:35,050
wouldn't lose sleep over okay another

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:42,239
big hand for Jeremy

00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:42,239
