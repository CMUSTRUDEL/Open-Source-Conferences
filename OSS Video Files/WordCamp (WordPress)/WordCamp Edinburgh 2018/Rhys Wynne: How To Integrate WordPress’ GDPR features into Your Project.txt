Thank You Somali greeneries hello

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,959
everybody I am Reece and as I said it's

00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,519
talk to you today about how to integrate

00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:21,160
your GDP our features there impress into

00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:23,920
your project so I'm first of all to

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,250
begin with I am NOT a lawyer I am NOT a

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,109
lawyer I attended speed warrior there's

00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,730
a lawyer and I did date one once I did

00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:43,920
they want one for about six months but

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:48,190
apart from that all myself so I am in

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,949
2015 2009 I got a plug-in called WP Iman

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:54,850
character basically what it does is

00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:57,069
allows you to pull into your site if you

00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,870
name an email box and it sends an email

00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:02,769
saying do you want to subscribe to my

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:04,750
newsletter they don't click yes please

00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:07,960
save the email address and the name of

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,430
the database you can then explore some

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,830
politics or something like MailChimp or

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,960
something to send email actually having

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,230
probably worked that way now my plug-in

00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:24,640
is designed to collect data so I can't

00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:27,940
see come by and gdpr came about in late

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,210
May so I left it really really gritty

00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,980
late and it daily made I began working

00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,810
on my own solution my own solution was

00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,610
basically have a privacy policy box and

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,860
there's back ends of my plugin you could

00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,840
copy and paste from the various ecology

00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,140
box into your privacy policy and you

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,530
could also export and delete data based

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:55,390
on email addresses it worked it did work

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:58,990
but in was already very robust so 16th

00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:01,090
of May 2018 there were as much as

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,040
WordPress user group I've had a came

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,950
down and gave a talk on the work that

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,819
she'd been working on with the privacy

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,489
team and it was a mate it was like oh my

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:13,760
goodness this is like everything which I

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:17,390
have been doing

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,709
I'll say plug in developer I had to kind

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,300
of make a decision and I'm a decision

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:23,180
them then to basically scrum what was

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,250
effectively two weeks worth of work most

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,239
of it scrapped and decided to integrate

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:31,580
with WordPress's Rosi features the

00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:36,530
reason for it was twofold first of all

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,599
from a first of all from a developer

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,099
standpoint it was far easier for me to

00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,360
maintain because rather than just me

00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:46,400
maintaining it I have a large WordPress

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,989
community who would be maintaining those

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,239
tools and it was also bad for the users

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,560
because rather than go into the users

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,489
and go right okay if you need to do a

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,110
gdpr export or DDP I'll request you need

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,150
to go here oh yeah except from my plug

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,280
you might need to go here so you need to

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,150
do - we can just train user to kind of

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:13,040
go to one place do one GDP other quest

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,720
from that so that was May 16th May 17th

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,609
where press four point nine point six

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,430
was released it was last and security

00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,750
release but probably should have been a

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,930
mine or at least because the amount of

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,519
features in added I'm not going to

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,799
mention the gene word but there's all

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,079
sorts of reasons behind WordPress and

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,760
blanket four point nine six instead of

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,660
four point at which you should have been

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:44,690
but it wasn't automatically updated

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:45,680
initially but eventually it was also you

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:56,150
do the future something

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:59,390
it was okay the 4.96 had a number of

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,239
privacy features they have a privacy

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,750
policy creator a data exporter and the

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,170
data eraser it did have also a lot more

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,269
features that we're not going to talk

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,980
about in this talk such as like if you

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:17,120
leave a comments you can choose whether

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,859
to keep your name and email address in

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,109
the cookies in the comment box by

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,580
sending the cookie we're not going to

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,460
talk about those but they're all there

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,479
but for the purposes of the next 15 to

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,889
20 minutes we're going to be talking

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,539
about these features and find something

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:35,270
to break them project the first thing is

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,970
approaching policy creator when you go

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,650
to settings and then privacy you can

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,330
choose a privacy policy page on your

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,060
site this can either be one you've

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,270
already written or it can be one that

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,030
exists that you haven't written but you

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,150
can create a brand new page that is

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,130
treated as a privacy policy page what

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,099
happens is when you kind of create this

00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,570
page like similar when you've got like a

00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:02,090
front page or you've got like a news

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,479
page like you have a little label by you

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,310
know a label just as crimson policy page

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,060
when you go to the page this is on the

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,370
classic editor you get a guardian prompt

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,830
and this is this is equal to both when

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,289
you create a page and if you assign your

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,120
page to be your privacy policy you get a

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:21,979
little prompt that says you need help

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,630
putting this together check out you guys

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:26,840
for recommendations of what content to

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,020
include and there's a link into the

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,759
approve of policy guide the only

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,250
difference is you create the page and if

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,320
you've already got a page assigned is if

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,990
you create a page those headers are

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,610
automatically pasted into below but if

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,930
you've already got a page assigned it's

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,820
not

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,229
when you click on that link to go to the

00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,990
college you get taken to the primacy

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,900
policy code this is like an introduction

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:54,169
it basically says this but bunch of

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,850
headings and it kind of says right this

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,539
is what you need to write for these

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:02,539
sections you will need to write it it's

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,310
not boilerplate is on the whole the

00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:07,880
reason being is that everybody's got

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,979
different sites you could have a you

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,360
know kind of Facebook pixel pixel which

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,669
you'll need to account for you could

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,949
have for google analytics which you'll

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,660
need to account for equal you know could

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,919
have a Bitcoin miner I don't know why

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,770
you'd want to put one on your side but

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,050
you could have one be and you need to

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,300
write sections for these for every

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,840
single plate after every single than

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,740
they have on this site now WordPress

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,080
does things that it knows what it's

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,639
doing so so basically things like when

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,470
you log into your site we put a cookie

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,849
on your computer because that way you

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,199
don't have to log into every single page

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:46,639
and things like that

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,979
now those those things that kind of

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,169
known so there is a there is kind of

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,110
boilerplate to text now if you're a

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:57,919
plugin owner or you write a plug-in you

00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:00,139
can't actually out to this page and you

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,630
can do so by the way this is all the

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,580
code but if you go to that link I don't

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:09,139
put this line zip up there so this is a

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,669
code example so you can see this so you

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:15,949
can actually add to this page so for

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:19,460
example you can add to the admin init

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:22,310
action which is an action that runs on

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,490
any admin page that's initiated you can

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,349
add a function I call my function to EP

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,409
email capture privacy policy content

00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:34,880
I've run it quite late this is just a

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:37,130
very basic function that runs the WP

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,840
underscore add underscore privacy

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,510
underscore policy and it's all content

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,840
function this function has two

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:46,820
attributes pregnancy sorry the first

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,889
parameter is the title so if you want it

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,010
to be a title on the page this could be

00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:53,880
like a section so

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:56,810
wp1 capture and the second parameter is

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,640
content so this block here is just the

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,010
looker text on what my plugin does and

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,420
the data it collects and you can add to

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:09,240
the page when you update to this version

00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,980
that plug-in or if you add this to your

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,660
plug-in you'll get a notification at the

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,850
top of the page say this is just to

00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,040
privacy policy text has changed please

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,710
review it which encourages the user to

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:24,450
their interview the page and to make

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:26,100
changes so you can see here see here

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,770
like the source that would be able to

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,450
capture that's a title and its body you

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:37,050
can press copy and you can copy it and

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:39,240
paste it into your privacy policy second

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,560
section is the user Explorer page which

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,680
is added in the tool section it's called

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,170
to export personal data when people make

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,090
a request for data they generally use a

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,950
request such as your email address or

00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:53,370
username and then they click send

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,650
request an email gets sent to the

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,690
username or email address requiring

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,840
confirmation so you're basically safe hi

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,910
we've received this request full user

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,250
export please confirm you are who you

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:09,180
say you want to stop people making

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,760
airiness request you've got this next

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,190
step once once they click the link it's

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,330
this next step change for waiting from

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:22,110
confirmation to confirmed once confirmed

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,310
you can download the data attended to

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,630
them now you can actually come loaded

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:29,220
before they confirmed as well to you

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,170
when when you download data you get a

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,090
file a little something like this so

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,250
this is like your personal data export

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,720
and it's basically all the density house

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,300
this is this is one of my test sites

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,650
with my email address so everything

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,900
associated with the email address so you

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,250
can see at the bottom I've uploaded a

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,150
couple of images there are sites where

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:52,530
you are dressed

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:54,390
so that they can say yeah now you can

00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:58,080
add to this page and come out to the

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:01,620
export file to do this you need a filter

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:06,300
which is WP privacy personal data

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,830
exported this filter is connected to an

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,940
array which lists all the Explorer

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:16,890
functions as the sim array you can add

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:20,760
to it you can add to it an array with

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,610
two keys exports a friendly name so this

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,480
is like in my case of wpml capture which

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:30,000
basically says that if it goes wrong you

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,650
know where to look to kind of fix it and

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,810
it also adds callback which is a

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,460
callback condition and I'm going to

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,610
apologize because the next slide is

00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,160
really complex

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,420
so the callback function will be

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,220
something like this this is only part of

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,130
it and then only pollow relevant part of

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,140
it start off the callback function by

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,300
grabbing your data however you choose to

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,760
do that whether it's in MySQL query

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,650
whether it's a I mean it could be in an

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,900
API however you choose to do it you grab

00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,860
the data and you have it in whatever

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,830
format you choose

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,270
you then need to put it into an array so

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:10,830
this is the data array on the side and

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:15,090
this data array you two keys in an array

00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:17,310
it is the first key is name which is the

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,860
name of the data and the second key is

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,680
value which is the value in the data so

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,900
for example if you have a Twitter handle

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:30,300
the name will be Twitter handle the

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:32,310
value would be at or whatever you don't

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,160
have this data roaming right so this

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,020
data I'm sorry you don't put this into

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,420
another array which is called export

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:45,690
items over here this has four attributes

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,160
first one is group ID which is the group

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,350
that you want to associate with this

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,040
data so it can be post page media

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,910
comment whatever or you can give it your

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,820
own so

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,400
it's a dopey mile capture the grip label

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,800
is a human-readable name so my case of

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,560
double piedmont capture data and i said

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,240
item ID which is like a unique

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,080
identifier for it and all the data

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,140
you've created in the previous step you

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:16,070
then take battery and put it into

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:21,360
another array which is the dasie return

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:23,850
so this array has two attributes a turn

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,490
which is everything you've built up to

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,100
this point and dun dun is either true or

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,420
false so if you have a lot of data you

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,540
may want to kind of split this up into

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,330
two or three different two or three run

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,730
throughs if you click and if you return

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,880
false the function runs again if you

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,160
return true it goes on and do something

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,630
else

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,300
complex I apologize it's a lot easier

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,560
from here on it what you end up with is

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,110
something looks like this so this is

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:56,640
like this is my degree label and they

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:59,690
supplied the group of the group ID the

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,190
left-hand column is all the names and

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,280
the right-hand column is all about the

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,280
user

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,230
use the leisure page the use of deletion

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,620
page works very similar and very similar

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:20,290
to what happens is a user will send an

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:24,279
email so make a request to delete the

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:26,649
data and you give them either a user

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,320
name associated with it with the data or

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:36,520
an email address this send sends an

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:39,399
email to the user so as we've received

00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:43,089
requesters delete your data please

00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,800
confirm they don't confirm and then you

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,839
can then go ahead and delete the data

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,490
again you can delete it beforehand but

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:55,000
you probably got a lot of people similar

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,040
to the exporters you have an eraser and

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,690
you have it you having a filter for

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,250
erasing data and that's WP under school

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,459
of privacy and school personal and it's

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:10,120
called a token school for ages this is

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:14,380
an array of all raising functions so you

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,200
can add to it similar to the exporter

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,500
there's you add to it an array with two

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,690
kitties arrays a friendly name so that's

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,810
the name so if something goes wrong you

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,560
can know where to look the debugging

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,560
under callback function

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,490
in the callback function you build a

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,080
function at the lease items for your

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,060
database table however choose to do it

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,600
again API

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:46,300
you know the VP query SQL however you

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,780
choose to do so more than a liter when

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,570
you have the query the runs you return

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,670
an array with four values and all the

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,490
thing is because because there's no data

00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:01,450
return you can't be returned too much

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:04,120
but you have to return something you

00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,340
return then arrivals Paulk each items

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,110
underscore removed is a number of items

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:13,570
Eva roses like the road users removed

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,110
items retained Isis retain means that

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:20,610
any data leave choose to retain for

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:23,830
whatever reason you can do so I think

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,870
again not a lawyer but I believe you

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:30,430
need to retain sales records for example

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:34,960
for some pointers messages and messages

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:37,030
you want to send and a done filter so if

00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,420
you need to run through this process

00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:42,310
through all times for false he only

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:49,200
needs to run through at once returned

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:54,640
Terry I race through this it's a unicorn

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:56,470
right a useful option is WP underscore

00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,280
page under school involved underscore

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:03,790
privacy under school policy this is an

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:07,000
ID for the privacy policy page so if you

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,070
need to be more plug-in or theme linked

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,170
to it use that ID and use a get

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,170
permalink on that anything to return

00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:20,220
being principal see you page you cannot

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,260
call if you choose to release your

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,980
plugins on the wordpress.org repository

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,140
you cannot call them DDP element the

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,709
reason being was hypothetically speaking

00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,570
this is a thought experiment but you if

00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:36,329
you have one plug-in that makes your

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:40,560
site gdpr compliant which doesn't exist

00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:42,269
for those two you can I would you are

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,100
working in Allah you're working in a

00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,899
coffee shop with your laptop and you

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,380
take a phone call and you leave your

00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:50,790
laptop open all of a sudden what was

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,459
your and you're working on your

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,959
WordPress site and you logged in all of

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:58,709
a sudden that plugin can't do anything

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:03,269
really so you can't call the gtp are

00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:07,169
compliant what I use is compatible with

00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:10,339
WordPress is courtesy features or GDP

00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:13,850
are friendlier or something like that I

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:18,179
prefer using being compatible with

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:21,750
pretty pictures that doesn't mean you

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:24,660
shouldn't do this taking away the moral

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,929
and legal reasons for doing this sort of

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,690
work it's actually when I introduce this

00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:33,510
into my plugin from a business

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,910
standpoint I had number of people who

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:40,559
turn you switched from other people's

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:41,500
plugins to money not everybody does this

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,520
either

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:50,260
through the fog VIP plugins abandoned or

00:17:47,520 --> 00:18:06,940
you know they have reasons for not doing

00:17:50,260 --> 00:18:51,580
if you can which is available there's a

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:53,679
lot of yeah I mean I mean generally

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,470
meant I woulda seen him just like a

00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,100
contact form right so building club

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,799
where'd I put some form that right I

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:07,990
don't think there is to the best of my

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:11,169
knowledge I would do I just if you put

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:13,440
in your privacy policy I'm assuming if

00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:16,059
you if you want to order requesting

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,760
either email this I mean this is this is

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:20,260
more for stuff that I've done outside of

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,970
this is for plan stuff is when they've

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,080
rewritten the protein obviously they

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:31,080
usually include

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:34,360
address in it obviously in terms of

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,610
details elution is there any move from

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,470
wordpress to give us functionality to do

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:47,679
opportunity twice keep him by having

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:50,380
expiry dates against the data well but

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,090
to give us the opportunity to again so

00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,039
maybe i keep your data for five years

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,659
and years for seven years so again and

00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,549
also its granular so you may have

00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:00,159
multiple pieces of data in a single

00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:02,049
record we would have different deletion

00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,299
dates one thing we're looking at is

00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:07,149
putting a did we do this I don't know

00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:08,919
who did this but putting obfuscating the

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:10,450
personal data out of comments after I

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,130
think they're long time with six months

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,330
so that after six months it's just to me

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:18,700
it's not the IP address if you'd like us

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,830
to build that functionality for certain

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,779
things you can look at that but because

00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,179
it's so granular is really difficult to

00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:29,110
provide a one size fits all in a

00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:30,909
situation yeah so it almost becomes this

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:34,690
is why reese's tom is so is so valuable

00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:36,850
because he's showing how he put that

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,279
into one specific plugin or one specific

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,370
purpose as opposed to trying to create

00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,019
some sort of universal functionality so

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,279
if there's any specific specific user

00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:47,649
case you need before I'd love to hear

00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:50,830
about it looking like medical records

00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:52,000
yes of like small businesses yeah and I

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,010
know that they're going through that

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,230
metal filing cabinets after so many

00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,570
years and putting the naive original you

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,240
know could we not do something for there

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,769
and you know it be specific to them so

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,889
they could put their own timescale on

00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:07,240
but yeah and again that's assuming that

00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,769
all the records that you need to delete

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,750
live within a wordpress database yeah

00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:13,510
that's exactly yes yeah really

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,659
yes no it's not an easy things what

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,460
we're doing

00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:18,349
see teams were encouraging people to

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,090
come to us with these specific cases

00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:22,809
like tell us what we need to build

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,249
because we're very much working off of a

00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,899
theoretical and very knowledgeable basis

00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:28,519
but what we're missing is people say

00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:32,450
like right if I have X blogger that

00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:37,269
doesn't help me with this so one thing I

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:38,659
do when I talked about scrapping the

00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:41,570
already done

00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:43,129
I did actually keep some of it and one

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:48,649
of the features I did keep was the

00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:49,879
automatic deletion of the of the record

00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:53,539
so basically the way we look like it

00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:56,889
works is it stores data in one table

00:21:53,539 --> 00:22:00,470
that and then moves it to another table

00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:04,220
once it's you know ones people that

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:06,830
prefer what is in the first table I put

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,440
in I've put in something into my plugin

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,450
that basically wants every bag I think

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,619
it does it deletes data that's older

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,999
than three months because the chances

00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,779
are they're not going to click on there

00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,509
yeah

00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:20,239
so for something like that I built I

00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:24,349
kept that which is just a very very

00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:26,059
simple function yourself again that's

00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:28,419
because I know the data I'm working with

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:31,599
yeah and I know what to do with it so

00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:31,599
that's why

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:41,860
I mean any other general privacy

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:44,080
questions that's a great question I'm

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,070
not gonna code that in campus you have

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:51,580
to be possible to abstract that so that

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,090
say I could say now I know what I'm

00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,470
working with

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,080
the law says I need to keep it for five

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,090
years and then I can just say all right

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,400
so like five five years and then a new

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:05,020
run once everyday it's a check

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:10,740
oh how old is this five is Albany yeah

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:14,230
it would be possible and to be honest

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,880
it's fairly simple so it's one of those

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,320
things where it's like if I because it's

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,850
because it's like it's specifically

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,280
designed for my plug and it's actually

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:24,100
really really kind of this was four or

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,049
five lines of code just open the

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,179
database check check a date records and

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:31,210
things like that

00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,640
it depends I know that there's a date

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:38,260
record in my table so I know this is

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:40,210
this is where to go from once people

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,830
will saw date people's tour dates in

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,970
various different formats some people

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,760
will store it in the tactical some

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,250
people's for it as a as a proper date

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,530
time object and things like that so it

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,390
would be kind of tricky to kind of do it

00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,480
but so this is this is why I'm trying to

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:58,059
say I mean I can put it up and you can

00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,429
you can see it and start from there

00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:06,070
that's that's not a problem but it's

00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:13,750
tricky to generalize it because of I can

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:18,640
show you it because you've already done

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:19,960
it it might be a great tip there's not

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,700
for cardboard but something that you

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,440
wouldn't look I'd be like oh maybe I

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,909
should just yeah make sure that I'm

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,870
storing my days correctly so that I can

00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:31,720
check them yeah probably I mean within

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:34,390
this is because I mean for my plug-in I

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,270
had to go in when I am update when I

00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:39,159
release this version I have added the

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,809
date column because it wasn't there to

00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,010
begin with you what it was in one of the

00:24:40,809 --> 00:25:46,270
tables it wasn't in the other

00:24:42,010 --> 00:25:49,090
so yeah I mean okay that's all of our

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:51,280
world oh yeah yeah

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,620
some years five years I'll keep up so

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:59,110
things can change if you have to get rid

00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:01,870
of it after you stop using it so was it

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,220
a point to do so there's there's no

00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,180
throwing out the baby with the bathwater

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,820
is the other way around

00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,710
any data that you are obliged to keep

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,300
for any other statutory reason does not

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,190
have to be wiped out that's one of the

00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,170
most commonly that's the two most

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,520
commonly misunderstood aspects of the

00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,590
right to be forgotten or number two the

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,150
absolutely everything and number two it

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,670
is a universal right no it's the right

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,750
to oppressed it the right what I always

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,800
tell people is right to be forgotten

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,990
it's not the right to fly under the

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,330
radar so for example that you have to

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,340
keep seven years of purchasing sales

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,160
records for tax purposes it's even more

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,800
I think Italy it's ten years you so the

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,690
trick the challenge for us is have you

00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,340
come up with a means of deleting the

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,660
information you don't have to keep which

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,760
frankly shouldn't be on your database

00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,680
and keep still keep those records you

00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:51,180
need for other statutory purposes other

00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,500
thing is like if you've got like someone

00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,420
who's abusing the system trying to hack

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,210
in or whatever you don't have to delete

00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:01,470
that record so there's no black and

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:03,480
white binary or delete be aware of what

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,660
information about a you have to keep for

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,620
statutory purposes and then what the ICO

00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,030
would like to see is that you come up

00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,130
with a data retention and deletion

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,020
schedule for everything you hold how you

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,550
define how long you keep that data it's

00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,690
entirely up to you as long as you can

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,520
document justify it you say we keep all

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,730
[Music]

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,530
contact form submissions for a year for

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,210
x y&z reasons that's fine as long as you

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,790
justify what they're looking for is

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,590
people who have you know the the proper

00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,050
focus I always talk about in the

00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,880
conference meeting the charity that had

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,650
five years of contact form submissions

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,290
of people's sensitive medical data on

00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,610
the website database hacked you know

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,750
there's no reason for any that those

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,430
forms to be there for more than six

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,810
weeks they had five years worth so five

00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:49,440
thousand confidential medical records

00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:52,020
leaked as long as you can explain and

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,140
justify why you're doing things they're

00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,920
fine with that but as I advise people

00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,080
make sure it passes the lab test

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,730
if your explanation would make someone

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,700
laugh at you you need to go back and

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,050
revise it be surprised what nobody

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,790
should be surprised what that got home

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,200
and this is one really healthy things

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,090
that I found in all the GDP our work

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,800
I've done it's making people go back and

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:16,700
say okay what do we have where do we

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:19,340
have it oh my god we've got you know zip

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,710
drives we've got paper files um I love

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,390
this giant purge that's happened in past

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,420
six months of like completely useless

00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:29,800
paper and terabytes of outdated data

00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,800
that just didn't get me there

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,650
cuz I'm doing work in Hawaii I'll just

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,060
be like yes okay five minutes so very

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,240
very quickly so when you log in to my

00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:43,070
project you there's a box here called

00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,920
enable GDP our side this is all the

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,860
features I kept I've put the privacy

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,530
policy thing in here which is basically

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,420
replicated on the privacy policy section

00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,790
so I've got thinking about how long you

00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:00,290
want to keep the data on your server so

00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:02,510
for example to ten days now you see here

00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:04,940
I've signed up to this email address the

00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:07,040
email address have probably been is

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,880
longer than ten days ago so in theory

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:16,300
that should I won't delete actually

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:19,100
because it needs to run it once per hour

00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,140
so what will happen will be at some

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,930
point that will be deleted within the

00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:29,060
next hour or so

00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:31,010
as in the code the code is run in this

00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,450
line here which is an alkie function so

00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,210
this is like a cron job that runs want

00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:37,940
to know and this is the GDP are no GMO

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:43,930
captured GPR deletion

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,930
when you go to it this is the function

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:53,560
I still check I'm still failing you with

00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:05,060
right so basically your function and

00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:08,090
runs every hour if the GDP our features

00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,980
are enabled you get the unit the unit is

00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,960
day to eat once or whatever and the

00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,770
number is the ten that I put there

00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,420
it then says well basically if the if we

00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:21,290
have a unit so it's present and the

00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:25,280
number is more than zero we grab the

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:27,250
time string which converts it from so

00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,100
basically we we get the time with now

00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:38,660
and we get we convert it into the MySQL

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:40,480
day for fact if then runs a couple of

00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,940
SQL queries which is basically delete

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:48,100
from Temple members table and richest

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:53,120
member table where date is less than

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:56,720
what the date is and it just runs those

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,970
