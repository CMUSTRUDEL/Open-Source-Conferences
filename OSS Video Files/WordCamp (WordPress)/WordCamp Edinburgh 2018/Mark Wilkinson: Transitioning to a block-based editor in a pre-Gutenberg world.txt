Description: 
	How do we move towards a block-based admin UI in a pre-Gutenberg WordPress?
With the rise of page builders and ‘block-based’ layouts, and the imminent arrival of Gutenberg – WordPress’ new block-based editor – we needed a solution for transitioning towards this new way of editing content while sticking with the mature and stable technology stack that we know and love.
We, therefore, set out to find another solution and this led to the development of the HD ACF Blocks plugin that we use on most sites today.
This talk introduces the plugin, how we built it, how it works, and how it provides value to our clients and our business.
