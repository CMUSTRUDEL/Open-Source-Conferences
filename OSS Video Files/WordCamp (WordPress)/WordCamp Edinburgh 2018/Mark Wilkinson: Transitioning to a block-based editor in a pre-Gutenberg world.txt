Title: Mark Wilkinson: Transitioning to a block-based editor in a pre-Gutenberg world
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Edinburgh 2018
Description: 
	How do we move towards a block-based admin UI in a pre-Gutenberg WordPress?
With the rise of page builders and ‘block-based’ layouts, and the imminent arrival of Gutenberg – WordPress’ new block-based editor – we needed a solution for transitioning towards this new way of editing content while sticking with the mature and stable technology stack that we know and love.
We, therefore, set out to find another solution and this led to the development of the HD ACF Blocks plugin that we use on most sites today.
This talk introduces the plugin, how we built it, how it works, and how it provides value to our clients and our business.

because working brilliant motors yes so

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm gonna talk to you today about how we

00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,890
have moved to using a block-based editor

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,500
in WordPress before Guttenberg well to

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,810
think and as been little bit as well

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,609
about how we're going to try and move

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:34,290
that towards easily invert as well

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:36,899
obviously it's very very imminent so my

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,030
name is Marc I am a founder of a

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,030
WordPress agency called Paradise digital

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,570
so first of all this talk is going to

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,670
talk about an alternative approach this

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,239
is not to say that we don't like

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,370
Gutenberg it has issues yes but it's not

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,989
something that we're saying don't use it

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,420
just wasn't right for us when we started

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,850
this journey so we ended up going in a

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,250
different direction but that's what this

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,320
talks want to be about we will use

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,909
Guttenberg definitely but it just wasn't

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,220
right at the point in our journey when

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:20,180
we decided we needed to allow our

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:20,180
clients to use it so just a little bit

00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:28,979
so how did this all come about in our

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,950
journey well we've noticed over the last

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,000
few years that designs have changed and

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,829
we've get designs we're not actually

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,829
design agencies we don't do much design

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,200
ourselves at all we are our twenties get

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,299
a design build this in WordPress and the

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,119
designs we received changed over the

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,250
last five six years and the designs we

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,439
are receiving now are becoming more and

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,540
more challenging to level customers to

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,310
be able to keep editing that the content

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,500
of their website and what's the point

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,119
make that easy and intuitive so you

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,479
don't have to anything's in 14 different

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,950
places to make it work and because of

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,780
designs have changed things have got a

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,100
little bit more tricky and it led us to

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,540
this approach thinking and how can we

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,670
make this easy how can we actually help

00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,520
the car plans to make the editing

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,900
experience a lot easier so let's have a

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,150
look at a typical sort of design

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,500
we've seen three or four years ago we

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,019
probably wouldn't have received this one

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,470
because it's the Facebook News blog site

00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:29,000
things actually wordpress.com and and

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:33,379
this is kind of the traditional design

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,909
that most websites kind of all bike back

00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:40,579
in the day not a month ago actually and

00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:44,930
as you can see it's got edit so the

00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:47,659
header is usually worth usual have a

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,120
menu in there and possibly some some

00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:51,470
sharing the store from there be but most

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,900
sites had some sort of a header with the

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,720
menu in it that's what they look like

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,950
most artists have this block of content

00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,959
well you could put images you could put

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,049
links but usually there's just a block

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,359
of text with some things like that it

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,709
was the main body of the article and in

00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:11,510
this case it's no different Scott

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:13,790
headings got a publish date etc often

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,019
they had a sidebar it doesn't have to be

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,430
on the right it doesn't have to be able

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,540
to work sometimes it doesn't actually

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,849
have to be at the side

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,799
but they'd have this idea of concept of

00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,690
a sidebar that it displays on the site

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,459
in this case it's got like the

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:31,010
legislatively so you can click on view

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:33,859
news from particular categories authors

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,019
in it you know there's lots of examples

00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:39,739
but essentially as a sidebar somewhere

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:42,560
on the page and and then at the bottom

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,810
we've got the footer so this user has

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,470
often a menu again and some sort of

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,989
copyright information sort of stuff

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,930
so that's what an old design kind of

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,180
look like this is a more modern design

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,500
that we've been working on recently and

00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,989
these are the designs that we will

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,510
receive from the from the designer so

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,220
come we build these in WordPress and as

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,159
you can see some of those concepts have

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,949
disappeared so we do have some sort of a

00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,900
header up here and it changes on every

00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,340
page this is this hero section at the

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,079
top and we've got different images

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,019
coming in some have a different layout

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,370
somehow a video behind them etc I'm

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,109
still got men you've still got the

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,560
longer idea that's always kind of the

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,419
same

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,699
oh we've got a footer which even

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,699
probably say is this similar this has

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,069
got some sort of

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,990
many users of cones and something cut

00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:34,020
battle with ice water areas where you

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,539
can drop off which it in and this ways

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,189
it in common concrete but this being the

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:40,409
middle is work changes this is actually

00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:42,689
a snippet of this design it's been more

00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:45,240
of these down the page I've cut it up so

00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,740
you can see on the slide but we've got

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,740
these sort of sections going across the

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,259
page with an image and some text and the

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,599
call to action woman cetera this is

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,939
another page from the census I'm this

00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,979
has got some videos it's got some post

00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,360
grid at the bottom here obviously these

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,569
we've got a featured image is one of the

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,099
obviously displayed out on the side and

00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:10,349
this is on page so so these pages are

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,569
kind of built or four blocks box of

00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:14,219
content you see them across the page of

00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,099
how I want in greed and money right and

00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:18,449
I suppose this is what good mobility is

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:21,029
trying to solve in that we can build

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,680
pages of these blocks and output these

00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,479
blocks on the side and his little page

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,400
you could say there's three blocks here

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,080
cuts off this is the same type of block

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,819
obviously it's just reversed where the

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,979
image goes on the right rather than the

00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:35,879
left and then we've got the content with

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:41,520
the bottom so those are the blocks of

00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:45,229
the page so what is the problem with

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,229
that with with WordPress

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,980
so we go back to the old design older

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,510
design and we had things in WordPress

00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,870
that we could use to build this design

00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,610
so at the head of there we've got a

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,290
beautiful menu system in WordPress that

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,960
allows us to build all of the menus that

00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,970
could be nested we can assign them to

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,830
different locations within the theme we

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,390
can custom links to them we can do all

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,010
sorts with it there's even plugins where

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,600
you can turn them into mega menus and do

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,250
all sorts of things so we've got a

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,570
really good menu system brilliant we've

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,150
got somewhere in the WordPress admin to

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,670
edit out this content block on the Left

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,100
we've got but we see we get it - it does

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,770
exactly that allows images in it allows

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,320
us to put text in links videos without

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:32,140
embeds all that sort of stuff it really

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,640
works quite well sidebars we've got

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,740
widget app widget as there is in

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,990
WordPress that can do that these are

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,430
just the default widgets elizabeth's all

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,980
your categories and similar with the

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,690
foot to footer with new widgets and

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,060
menus and things to make that content

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,490
editable so what that's worked really

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,980
well for this design because it gives us

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,390
gives the tools in the backend to our

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,760
clients to edit that content quite

00:06:52,390 --> 00:07:00,370
easily but how do we do this sort of way

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,430
out it becomes a bit more difficult how

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:08,680
do we allow someone to do that this

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,090
image left or right buttons titles how

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,040
do you like to do that in this editor

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,840
and it's not very easy and people have

00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,020
tried and tried and tries to make it

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,970
work and some successful some not so

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,340
successfully but we just don't have the

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,990
options in here it's brilliant for that

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,930
first design it does exactly what it

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,370
says this gets your text in there you

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,530
can't really do those dynamic sort of

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,160
way outs which you've got more design

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,600
score upon which was dead so many of

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,070
trailers have said so I just have a look

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,410
at some of the attempted solutions that

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,410
people have tried to make it work

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,720
so the first one is the good old

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,790
shortcut so I'm sure you've all seen

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,080
shortcuts there working like this so

00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,720
they're not as big as that in the editor

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,430
but just to prove the point it set there

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,050
in square brackets and there's usually

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,030
the string of text in square brackets

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,830
and what happens is when you save your

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,530
post and you view that on the front end

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,410
of the post that gets replaced with some

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,850
dynamic content so a popular one might

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,139
be that you'd have one that says like

00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:17,000
tweets retweets equals like for using M

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:20,780
equals WP barking it was short for

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,990
tweets from usually mark and that's

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,430
that's kind of an option that been used

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,610
quite a lot to try and get those down

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,400
anybody else in there but they're just

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,719
not very good I mean you're writing

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,880
something you need to know exactly how

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,099
to write it you don't have any visuals

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,330
to see what you're writing you know how

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,979
many parameters does this thing take

00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,300
there's nothing on the screen to tell me

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,279
that it's even available that can add

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,279
this to the page if you know about it

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,900
cuts great if you don't you don't some

00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,300
plugins add buttons where it says add

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,370
media so you can click a button and then

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,400
it'll drop this code into the page for

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:59,930
you which is good it's better it's not

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,430
perfect it's been tried to be sold if

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,520
anyone's ever used this pudding called

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,980
shortcake and it's it tries to provide a

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,290
user interface with short codes so it

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,540
allows a bit more of a beauty interface

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:15,350
so that users can add short calls

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:18,230
without having to type things in and

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,240
it's quite good actually it gives you a

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,190
screen like this so next to the add

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,350
Media button there's a button that says

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,970
I think this adds a post element you

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,860
click on that and then it pops up and

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,200
then any short codes that are available

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,700
have been registered with this plugin it

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,740
puts a book on the screen and says which

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,400
one you want to add so this is a like a

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,750
quartz

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,839
shortcode that gives you like a full

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,580
court or testimonial so you click on the

00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,900
button C at one write a testimonial and

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,600
then you get this food and you just get

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,430
boxes to enter information in and so

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,140
this is where the quality itself what's

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,400
on the quotes are to be and then you've

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,560
got the source of the quality of the

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,340
bottom lip and then I think some of us

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,800
just on this button there's a

00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,120
Cotton's about to post and then what

00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,250
that does is it drops the actual

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,960
shortcode itself that string of text

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,750
into the editor rather than you having

00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,100
to type it all out and the great thing

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,410
about this as well as he tries to

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,030
preview what that will look like on the

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,860
front end in the editor so you can

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,810
actually see what you're gonna get on

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,880
the front end as well it's not perfect

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,760
at doing that job but it's not bad it's

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,550
not bad I'd use this this plugin to do

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,020
things like before-and-after photos in

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,030
the editor so that you can see it was

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,760
quite well so that's something that's

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,650
been tried short cause they're very good

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,990
but they're not perfect and they need

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,340
they're not very intuitive for users the

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,230
dog know exactly what they are if you've

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,940
never seen them before then you know why

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,320
am i typing this string of text and then

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,740
on the front onions turning into this

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:46,230
sort of thing page builders there's lots

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,960
of them now lots of them and these are

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:55,200
just a few so we've got visual composer

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,340
element but there's quite a few of them

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,410
out there page builders and they've

00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,690
tried to solve this problem of allowing

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,420
clients to build up the layout of their

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,010
pages of different components so you

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,900
know I won't have another role I want an

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,940
image here want some text I want to put

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,150
a button underneath and to do that sort

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,690
of way that we've been provided and a

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,460
lot of them are very good and but a lot

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,220
of them on and a lot of them they all

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,110
save the date in a different way there's

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,270
no sort of common way that that happens

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,560
and moving between one page building

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,320
another page build that can often be

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,760
very difficult but they are getting

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,420
better and better and better all the

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,300
time

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,160
but she's got to be good now we've tried

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,410
some of these as an agency we've looked

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,030
at some of these and tracks from out but

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,120
they have some fundamental problems that

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:44,010
we just couldn't get past and the main

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,680
one is that let just provide too many

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,270
options for the clients there's just too

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,950
many things that they can control they

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,600
can control the margins and the padding

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,120
or everything they can control the

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,650
colors are everything actually that's

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,660
not what we want to other clients to do

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,450
they should be responsible for editing

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,770
adding their content and the site should

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,999
do the rest

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,379
essentially

00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:06,909
because otherwise they just become the

00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:09,099
designer what's the point in kind of a

00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:11,229
beautiful design when you just break in

00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:12,489
two seconds flat by changes and values

00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:16,449
that you don't you shouldn't be able to

00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:18,159
change so it comes very hard to create a

00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,979
website that sticks to the website's

00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,379
design principles the brand guidelines

00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:26,939
because people just want to experiment

00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:29,349
too much and most of these page builders

00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,969
have that out of the box some about than

00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:34,089
others some you can turn things off and

00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:39,879
give control but they're not they just

00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:40,989
give too many options for our liking and

00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,599
I suppose that brings on to the latest

00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:46,569
solution which is the Gutenberg Project

00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:53,859
itself which is going to be launched

00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:55,299
extremely suzet 20s today but we'll see

00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:57,579
we'll see what he comes it's certainly

00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:59,889
not going to be anymore it's gonna be

00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,239
probably even if it's not just before

00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,789
Christmas it'll probably just after

00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:06,039
Christmas and but it's coming and coming

00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:07,449
very shortly and I'm sure that

00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:11,169
everyone's got mixed opinions of what

00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:12,999
Gutenberg's like and I've used it Potts

00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:15,249
and ethically really good parts of it

00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:16,599
things are not so good parts of it I

00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:18,039
think are really good for developing

00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:21,009
parts of it I think they're not really

00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:23,169
good for developing but it's it's it's

00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:27,129
comments gonna stay and I'm sure that it

00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:33,189
will be a success in time which is she's

00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:34,989
good for some but as an agency it had

00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:37,929
some problems to start with but then we

00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:39,999
really couldn't use it so 12 months ago

00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:41,679
when we started on 18 months ago when we

00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:44,979
started on this journey of trying to

00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:48,009
create our clients to clearly create

00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:50,109
these block based sites and it wasn't

00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,399
really ready it had been started it was

00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:53,849
out there you could have a play with it

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,049
but it was just too much in his infancy

00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:58,509
it's written in a completely different

00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:01,869
language but I know so it's all written

00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:04,179
in JavaScript and I do use JavaScript

00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:06,879
but it's not really what I do so I'd

00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:10,449
have to learn all that in react some

00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,949
things which was difficult and it's up

00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,839
there some of the problems so the page

00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:14,740
builders suffer you've got lots of

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,570
options

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,160
so but if you've used it but if you have

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,900
power about the engines the background

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,840
color you can set a drop cap on it you

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,430
can change the font size and yes I'm

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,130
sure you can take those things away from

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,630
it again as a developer who doesn't know

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,480
of JavaScript very well that was really

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:34,270
difficult for me so we made the decision

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,920
early on that at this point in time we

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,330
couldn't go forward with using Gutenberg

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,120
and we needed to look for something else

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:45,370
to try and help our clients make these

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,400
sort of sites easy to manage so that

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,100
that brings us on to our solution the

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:57,220
solution we found to try and make this

00:14:51,100 --> 00:15:00,100
work and it's a very common solution

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,530
probably most of you have seen if you

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,030
don't use the self so you're not usually

00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:07,980
putting called advanced custom fields

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:10,720
then this is a plugin that allows

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,750
relatively straightforward actually uses

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,240
to create different admin screens to

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,190
allow users to enter data that can go

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,660
get out on the front end in a much more

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,280
straightforward fashion so for example

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,110
if you've got a pulse that is about a

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,210
person and it's displaying like a

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,130
profile information you could quite

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,930
easily edit screen where they just box

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,610
put a name in there a box for a job

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,350
title in that company their email

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,090
address the contact details of short bio

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,630
and the back end screens real easy to

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:43,810
create and it's nice and easy for the

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:45,610
users to understand how to do that but

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,470
there's one particular feature advanced

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,960
custom fields that we took advantage of

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,520
in Proverbs you actually paid for

00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,070
version it's not very much I think it's

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,280
about $25 for a license and it's called

00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:00,000
the flexible content field now this

00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,400
field actually allows us to build these

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,800
block base systems that Gutenberg's

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,090
trying to do you have any idea from what

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,750
to do with this little screenshot here

00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:12,490
so on sites that use this credits where

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,470
they want add some content they look at

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,670
this button you can change the label on

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,010
this button but it doesn't have to say I

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,660
draw so I think ours has add content or

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,820
add block or something like that and

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,530
then you get a choice of which types of

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,010
content that you want to add and these

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,829
wheel creates using the

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,089
wicked so I think the woman in the

00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:31,250
example that you saw on the designs

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,959
where we've got the image the text at

00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,600
the bottom we call that like a feature

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,100
role so we saw in the quite monster

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,139
iPhone we click add content and it would

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,519
say feature of it click that and then

00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,980
they get a screen that appears on that

00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,600
on this some fields that appear but it's

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,130
been like a forum with all the rad

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,279
fields throughout that content in for

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,139
that particular time so the facial

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,449
content fields allows us to create these

00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:55,100
different blocks and allow the users to

00:16:53,449 --> 00:17:02,540
choose which ones they want to add to a

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:04,250
page at a certain point in time so this

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,839
is an example of what the backend could

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,459
look like for a series of blocks so each

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:13,850
of these blocks with the dark-colored

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:17,120
headings is a flexible content field

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:19,040
it's a good invokes sense for such and

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,720
as you can see from the little animated

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,220
gif you can drag them up and down you

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,020
can reorder them just like you can do

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:30,410
both and content it so it brings an

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:33,200
element of layout building or as far as

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,900
page building to WordPress and and we

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,940
think this is a nice ease of use user

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,250
interface for clients to be able to

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,410
manage their content as you can zoom by

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:48,710
the Apple is what we've leveled it at

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:51,590
least use this for a few months and it

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,690
got to the point where thinking would do

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,669
the same thing here over again each

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,799
client wants the same sort of blocks so

00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:00,140
this is ridiculous we're writing the

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,210
same pieces of code for this client for

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,919
this client and for this client so what

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,110
we needed to do was to standardize this

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,020
and try and make it so that it was more

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,910
portable from one project to the next it

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,320
would save us time it would save

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,020
therefore the client modern because we

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,750
did enough to keep redoing things and

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:22,160
that was something we did when we built

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,720
this plugin called HD ICF box and so

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,240
this is something that we now use on

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,890
most of our sites so we didn't want to

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,900
have to do this every time with the

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,700
world is we'll build a plug-in and we

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,640
can add this to the sites that require

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,590
this sort of layout

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,010
so it works alongside that that's custom

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,270
field

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,040
obviously you need that installed and

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:43,400
activated to it to work properly or for

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,470
it to work at all and and the idea here

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,690
was that we'd have a suite of blocks to

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,190
be able to use at any client site so

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,200
it's quite in text comes along says what

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,880
I want of this sort of block we might

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,700
only have one that almost fits the bill

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,620
in which case we could use that and

00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,059
changing slightly well it might be that

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,160
we had a new one and then we could make

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,110
that available to everyone else or we

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,220
could have that available in our suite

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,740
to use and all the projects in the

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,230
future but what was really important was

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,580
thrown save time trying to make the code

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,490
base that we used all the time more

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:17,360
consistent so that we would be in a bit

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,770
more efficient in our development so the

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,570
actual blocks for you at the moment has

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,970
thing these are all of the box we have

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,320
the map you got my time this month so

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,660
we've got a four hour plot that logic

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,790
try to perform the users graph form so

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,410
you need an obviously we've got my own

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,820
callback recent content which means you

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,950
can display about the latest by post

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,750
from the post type or you could display

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,660
a post by the ten poles from this

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,760
category and so on feature well you've

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,710
seen a document so you have like a list

00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,140
of PDF documents often clients want to

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,480
do that do this word documents what

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,460
everyone was accordion because ref they

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,110
accused things like that a pricing block

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,410
that allows us to be like a pricing

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:57,080
table of different features or products

00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,460
if you like and a content blog probably

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,020
really bad with an end but centers us

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,260
just like the WYSIWYG box that you can

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,110
use like the normal content and hero box

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,809
or blocks or that allows you to either

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,790
have one hero section and that could be

00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:13,460
like an image with some description of

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,600
the top and title and that's a repeating

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,919
block as well so you can have more than

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,480
one here and it'll turn into like a

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,580
slider slider and then we've got a

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,110
little easier on that so and like I said

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,860
some of them have repeating blocks

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,750
inside them so

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,769
yes because the call-to-action he had

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,860
about one on you could have more than

00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:38,799
one the front end will sort of whatever

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:40,299
appropriately as it does that and so

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,399
this is an example of one of our blocks

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:45,190
so you this is the content block nice

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:47,860
and simple I'll show it and each block

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,870
has some right what we call default

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,059
field so we can we can turn them off on

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,679
and off for each block we want to do and

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:56,169
our default field essentially a block

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,700
title as most most blocks on page want

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:00,130
some sort of tag for a point somewhere

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,539
and a block introduction this one

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,029
doesn't have the introduction which is

00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:06,279
just like a paragraph of text you can

00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,750
add some stuff too and because obviously

00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,600
is always giving itself so you can just

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,070
put one in there and and they all have

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,940
this option at the bottom for a custom

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:17,230
class this one is it's a Content block

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,850
and you can see you can add another

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,380
column if you want it here so what this

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,000
is is just repeats this further down the

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,029
page you know from the time we can turn

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,470
that into a column based the way out and

00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:27,940
we can set a maximum number of columns

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,320
that they want to allow as well so we

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,299
could say you might have three columns

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:36,789
or four columns or two cones or the

00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:40,029
grayed out so we can't click it and then

00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:41,799
each block also has some an options tab

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:43,480
so we split it into a Content options

00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,549
content there's a better level than that

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,169
a sense of us I still forget yet seen on

00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:48,309
front end options and the things that

00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:51,250
they can sort of change for this

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:52,870
particular block so most blocks and

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,090
again we can turn these on and off on a

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,860
per client basis using our plugin so

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,809
most locks aladdin's have a background

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,880
color so they can set a background for

00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:03,580
the whole block across the page they

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,990
could use a background image and then we

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,419
had it this option on the right hand

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,100
side so if they choose a dark color

00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:10,539
obviously we can't have dark text on the

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,630
dark color so we need to build our way

00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:15,429
through 13 up tanks and there are there

00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,840
are sort of PHP libraries used as the

00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:18,610
temple cover these in the backend and

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,860
then but we found this was a good way of

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,539
doing it tick box and then it'll it'll

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,399
add a class to the to the block we can

00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,830
then use to sort of do something to

00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:29,019
change the color of it and each block

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,610
has the option for a custom class so if

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,080
you want to do something a bit different

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,789
with a barbecue in focus

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,580
passing there and these the customizer

00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:38,320
to create a bit of CSS and I put that

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,470
block in a bit of a different way so

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,970
that's how that works like I said all

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,929
these can be turned on and off on a per

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,669
client basis so it was really important

00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:51,010
when we started developing this that we

00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:52,690
wanted to develop in an extensible web

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,750
you're not sure what that means it's

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,850
essentially a code base that we can keep

00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,789
the send but we can change things

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,440
on a per clients basis without changing

00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,179
the code base of our plugin so that

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,240
always stays the same it's nice and

00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:09,190
stable and it means we can we can update

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,830
that code base and it's not a brick any

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,600
sites that that's gone on to so the way

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:17,230
in which we make it extensible is we

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,750
have lots of template overrides so each

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,399
of the blocks that you see on the screen

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:24,429
the plugin includes the front-end markup

00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:26,740
for that so and that is included in the

00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,899
plug-in so but what we've commit allowed

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,700
it to do is that if you include the same

00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:31,299
file in your theme it will use that

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,100
instead

00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:34,779
just like WooCommerce uses if you ever

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,600
use that you can override its template

00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:39,250
by placing them into your theme and that

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,769
allows us to then change the markup for

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,330
a specific client if that's if that's

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,730
needed for the design that we achieve

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,350
them with them so again we're not we're

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,049
not breaking the plug-in we're just

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:53,679
using the same file in your theme and

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,269
you can make some changes to it all of

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,419
the fields that make up all of the

00:23:55,269 --> 00:24:00,370
blocks are all filterable so they're

00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:02,559
essentially in a huge array in PHP and

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,240
as a developer I can take them out of

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,570
there I can push new fields into there

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,450
so if a client wants to have the call to

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,460
action block which has got like a title

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,440
of an image description and Apple to if

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,809
they want to a second button in I can do

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,580
that quite easily either in a plug-in or

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:20,440
in the theme functions file I cannot be

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,809
without a field into there and then we

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,399
could use the template authorized to put

00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:27,039
the template into the theme and actually

00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:30,100
output that extra field so it's nice and

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,870
extensible and there's lots of actions

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,850
and filters so each of the templates

00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,260
allows us to put content before and

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,049
after the different places

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,600
we've got classes that are all filter

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,370
all

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,049
so that we can add extra classes to

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,840
things we want to do them to spell and

00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:46,730
things like that and based on classes

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,610
there's a lots of helper classes so

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:51,080
where we've got a call to action block

00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,570
it will have a build class will be

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,970
output if we count many draw so as the 1

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,830
as the 5 is the 2 so we can use that to

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:01,429
style things in different different way

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,110
apps and this classes such as if they've

00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:03,740
added a background color and the class

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,860
gets added

00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:09,080
what has background color that was a

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,640
image class gets added how about the

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,650
background image so we can use those

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,600
classes to style the different blocks

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:18,289
based on the options that the client has

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:21,309
chosen the back end so it was really

00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:24,799
important that we built it extensively

00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:26,510
it isn't perfect by no means is it

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,789
perfect and we did face some challenges

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,210
when we were building this I want to

00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:33,799
just cover a few of those quickly now

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:37,179
so the first one was the actual backend

00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,799
interface it isn't perfect this is an

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:42,140
advanced custom fields flexible content

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,570
without was doing anything to it and

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,010
this is with all the fields collapsed so

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,539
you can click on these to expand them

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,900
and ensure that the fields inside them

00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:52,850
but it it's not very easy to see where

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,919
your content is on the front-end so

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,600
obviously this is a Content which

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,190
paragraph on the front end is inside

00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,900
that block what's at the top so it's

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,110
probably the first it's not that easy to

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:06,950
see where you content this so we tried

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:10,640
to make some improvements and it is a

00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:12,169
lot better than this which is a site we

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,690
actually got an inquiry about and they

00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:15,679
were saying we need some help we can't

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,260
edit our content

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,610
I think that's visual compose I think

00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,620
but yeah where is the content it's

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,659
somewhere in that it's better than that

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,330
so what did we do to try and prove this

00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:31,520
and we styled the headings so they were

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,740
dark and we found that really helped

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,049
could visually see the differences in

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,200
the different fields just stood out from

00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:40,549
the rest of the app a little bit and

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,400
you'll notice we also added additional

00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:45,080
tags on them so we've got content which

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,230
is the block name and then the block

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,730
title

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,080
welcome is what we put next to it so you

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,910
can see which section you're in on the

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,820
page from front end that's a bit nicer

00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,320
as well

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,640
heroes are usually used first so we

00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,169
didn't bother with us that's why you saw

00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,669
was obvious where they are and that's

00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,140
probably the best screen job because you

00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:03,450
prefer to see moments of it they go with

00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,860
more often but it just isn't that look

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,169
good or people make it look a bit nicer

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,110
and it's easy to find the different

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:12,210
sections all the things that the problem

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,280
is that obviously advanced custom fields

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,400
saves everything this post meta it's not

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,000
saved into the content of your post in

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,799
the database so as far as you know the

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,120
world is concerned there's no content

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,880
for all your post he doesn't have any

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,340
it's all the metadata why is that a

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,169
problem well it's not searchable by

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,299
default in WordPress WordPress doesn't

00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:34,620
search metadata by default there are

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,080
solutions for that there are plugins

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,809
that help you do that but this is not

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,309
perfect because it's not searchable all

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,919
the problems with that is that if you

00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:46,380
use Yoast SEO and I suppose it probably

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,850
everyone in the room does and you also

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,950
can't analyze your content on the page

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,630
because it isn't in the content of the

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,940
post and that's what you're supposed to

00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,049
do it tries to look at the content that

00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,750
you've written in that we see we get it

00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:59,190
to and I said we can't do that and again

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,380
someone thinks released a plug-in that

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:06,559
would help you do that we tried it is a

00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:09,929
bit flaky so that's a bit of problem and

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,419
and the last one is reusable box

00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:13,980
Guttenberg does this very very well if

00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,510
you specific overused Guttenberg you can

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,910
save a block and then you can use it in

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,650
multiple places it's really good and if

00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,960
you change the block once it changes it

00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,059
every word so that's quite nice and

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,500
clients didn't want that feature we've

00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,580
actually built that into our plugin now

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,470
and it works really well

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,900
and we've been trying with the design

00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:33,090
that you just saw before which was good

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,950
and it's working so far so good

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,270
so they can create a block and then they

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,580
can use it in all the other place on the

00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,470
website and then to change it in the

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,620
place we create

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,970
so that's been really good but I

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,770
wouldn't say been fully tested yet but

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:51,210
it is working and then and this can be

00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,770
real to the future and the next part of

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,770
our journey with with this plugin is

00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:59,100
that again I'm not a JavaScript

00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,240
developer so I can't sort of jump that

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,180
barrier have been able to develop

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,820
Gutenberg box-and-one and the great team

00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,190
at ACF have built tools into advanced

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,350
custom fields that allows you to pretty

00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,930
much correct fields than you used to in

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:15,420
ACF and make them available as a block

00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,410
in Gutenberg and this is something I was

00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,530
actually looking out on the train

00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,260
yesterday it's actually really good you

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,840
don't need too many JavaScript you can

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:27,830
write a bit of PHP not a lot and it will

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,870
create your block as a Guttenberg block

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,760
which then has the benefits of being in

00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,040
the Box content and that sort of stuff

00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,870
so this is something that's coming soon

00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,900
he's stealing beer actually the moment

00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:43,100
in the uplands custom fields I think

00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,110
there ought to be two two now that this

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,360
weather the launch as WordPress launches

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,770
a minute available Dom no but it will

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,420
obviously be absolute there is a blog

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,800
post on there if you want to read it I

00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,290
think there's a couple answers have been

00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,330
located to that one with some new

00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,690
developments in it so that's going to be

00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,830
our next project and it's going to be

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:05,420
converting our plug-in that we have now

00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:07,560
so that it will work in Gutenberg's well

00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,510
the best thing was to try and use the

00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,670
same plugin we've got and they call the

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,170
box available is both as I said how to

00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:15,000
put play with that and I'm not shield

00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,440
and they'll to do it or winds are

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,610
technical reasons why but certainly

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,560
we're going to look at building another

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,510
different one that uses Scouten burg and

00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,980
then we can have two alternatives

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,840
applied to use whether they want to use

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:29,550
duplicate or the one to stick with the

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:32,010
old system for now and and that's that's

00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,720
kind of neat as I said I'm mark I'm a

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,880
wordpress developer I tend to do more

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,180
back-end development than front-end at

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:43,230
all to follow me I am WP mark on Twitter

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:45,060
and and just look at the end we are

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,740
currently trying to hire a wordpress

00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,970
developer so if you're interested in a

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,970
remote role and

00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:05,080
if you enjoyed that it's gonna be more

00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:07,210
from mark tomorrow at 1:15 after lunch

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,440
in here in our glutton Burke out who's

00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:15,220
doing anything with Gutenberg's right

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:16,000
now is anybody making anything can you

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:31,240
tell us about it

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:39,490
I can't smart it does because ACF broad

00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:41,530
you have free version doesn't but I

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,570
think for just going back to that slide

00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:47,880
I'm pretty sure that's gonna be in the

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,880
free version to think so you might be a

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,910
bit of a nerdy question we've probably

00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,760
generics or a lot of fields of software

00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,920
development but so you built this isn't

00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,220
it extensible codebase so you've got a

00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,170
library of material is configurable yeah

00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,700
and you said you can bet you can change

00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,110
that library without breaking the stuff

00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,650
that's written in the older version

00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:16,300
forward how do you how do you make sure

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:19,800
how you regression test that you make

00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:22,750
sure even if you're David new stuff you

00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,440
don't break the old stuff that makes

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,860
sense in my head

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,990
yeah with difficult said is the answer

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,080
and something it depends what we do to

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:34,210
the plug-in in a way so obviously we've

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,240
got all the sites we build with it i

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,400
I've got a magazine or I've got

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,350
available to test it with I wouldn't

00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:45,360
test it with every site of ever done and

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,360
we'd always said to clients anywhere

00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,310
you know but I think I would not really

00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,350
automated things or anything like that

00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,900
that tested with I will be probably when

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,490
I'm developing something I'd be like

00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:01,460
that might break somethin if I do that

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:04,620
so I'm gonna test it before I do it

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,810
so yeah no perfect answer really but the

00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,210
way in which we would sort of edit the

00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,860
functionality would be through so you

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,410
would either I plug in to the site with

00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,350
SEO and then let's say we wanted to add

00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:18,120
some fields to our blocks or extra we

00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,520
most of us actually room we sort of have

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,290
a utility plugin which does all the sort

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,150
of site of tweaks and modifications and

00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,950
we just throw it in there with a

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,350
function that hooks into a filtering

00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,990
WordPress so that's do the modification

00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,310
to the actual core basic UI and the

00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,320
plug-in just sort of sits and stays the

00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:41,100
same if you like unless so it gets all

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:44,340
date or a reason yeah yeah is your HD

00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,680
box plugin public there you go terribly

00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,050
it's not yeah how's the first person who

00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,600
asked for elastica of this took it since

00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,730
early on at the moment and I don't know

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,380
whether we might release it on our first

00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,380
or something I don't think it would be

00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:05,750
it's not a moment it might be hosting

00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,750
space

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:18,830
thanks again barb

00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:18,830
