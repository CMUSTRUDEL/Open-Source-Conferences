Title: Ross Steedman: Tales From the Edge - Practical Advice from 10 Years in the WordPress Field
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Edinburgh 2018
Description: 
	I started working with WordPress 10 years ago – and I started my agency round about then too.
Join me for 30 minutes as I take you through the highs and lows of running a WordPress business. I’ll outline what I believe are some of the key things I did wrong, and I’ll provide you with a takeaway list of solutions to common problems, so you can avoid making the same mistakes I did.
I’ll be covering a wide range of topics including how we charged for work in the past and how we charge for work now.
This is a practical talk, for business owners who are starting out as freelancers, or transitioning between freelancer and small agency.
