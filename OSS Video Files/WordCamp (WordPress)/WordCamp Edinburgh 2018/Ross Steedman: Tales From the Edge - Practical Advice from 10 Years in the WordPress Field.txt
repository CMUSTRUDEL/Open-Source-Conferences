Title: Ross Steedman: Tales From the Edge - Practical Advice from 10 Years in the WordPress Field
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Edinburgh 2018
Description: 
	I started working with WordPress 10 years ago â€“ and I started my agency round about then too.
Join me for 30 minutes as I take you through the highs and lows of running a WordPress business. Iâ€™ll outline what I believe are some of the key things I did wrong, and Iâ€™ll provide you with a takeaway list of solutions to common problems, so you can avoid making the same mistakes I did.
Iâ€™ll be covering a wide range of topics including how we charged for work in the past and how we charge for work now.
This is a practical talk, for business owners who are starting out as freelancers, or transitioning between freelancer and small agency.

Eden just in case you need that that's

00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:43,989
cool so tales from the edge right when I

00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:45,010
thought about a title for this talk I

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,249
thought I should give it something

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,859
dramatic because it's been a dramatic a

00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:55,389
journey that Jason and I hope you know

00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:58,479
and Wow things can have been that buys

00:00:55,389 --> 00:01:02,079
candy well I thought I'd start off with

00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:06,010
a statistic and immediately lose visual

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:10,720
on the projector and if I give this cord

00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:13,000
a wiggle this is going to come back on

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,840
I believe this happened earlier on as

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,840
well fantastic

00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,910
okay somebody tell me if we get signal

00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:35,950
yeah

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:40,960
no dice ah fantastic I'll let you fellow

00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:44,670
into that Oh literally everything's gone

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,670
off okay yes

00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,540
No

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,750
okay right Julie's gonna get the

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,500
captions back up and running but I think

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,960
how who Sean and things kind of been

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,420
that bad kami well I looked at our

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,310
statistic just as was putting these

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,090
slides together and I'm just going to

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,830
read 38% there's been a 38% rise and the

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,390
number of business insolvency

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,160
appointments dude in the first quarter

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:38,700
of 2018 over 2017 figures so that's

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,100
almost a 40 percent rise and the number

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,140
of businesses having trouble the number

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,490
of businesses not having enough money to

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:50,040
see the bills and I I actually think

00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,230
that's quite an alarming increase if you

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,330
read the whole article maybe that is a

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:59,100
bit of a scary statistic to start with

00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,750
but yeah it's been tough I think and I

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,980
think if you're doing well at the moment

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,530
then you should be really proud of

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,820
yourself because treating conditions we

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,320
found would be tough we're having to

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,239
work a lot harder for the business now

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,670
we've been in business for almost as

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,450
long as this projector I think it's been

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:28,440
around let's go out okay

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:35,180
try again only the best word camera come

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,180
on you good at flicker

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:46,890
I'm gonna keep wiggling things around

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:48,180
just until yeah let's put them to the

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:55,170
wall I know we had issues with that

00:03:48,180 --> 00:04:02,180
earlier on no cowboy I will not be

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:02,180
beaten by technology yeah I'm fasting

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,519
yeah okay

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:49,350
yeah yeah how many WordPress people does

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:51,240
it take to fix up reject them yeah okay

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,420
I think we're going to get a different

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,420
one

00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,990
yeah thanks man

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,730
nice one there we go okay right thanks

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,500
pshaw you're gonna have to stand there

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,180
and it has been a bit of a journey right

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,470
and I've been working about WordPress

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,620
for 10 years we've been running an

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,770
agency for seven and yeah I could tell

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,580
you about the time we were fined by 500

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,930
pixels com4 using an unlicensed image on

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,720
a production website

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,970
yeah happened by accident but we've got

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,210
hands up to impede the thing at that

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,610
point in time if it had been three

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,050
images ten images immediate or into a

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,940
production wave say it would have sunk

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,100
my agency because we would not had the

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,250
money to be able to cater to what people

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,050
think I could tell you about the time a

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,670
client that we thought was really nice

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,030
and really good to work with repped as

00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:50,010
off for thousands of pounds I don't know

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,440
if anyone else can identify with that in

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,480
the room today but yeah when it happened

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,580
it was a crushing ball and we had to

00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,960
learn from it and move forward or I

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,210
could tell you about the time that we

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,790
were down to our last 100 quid and the

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,710
bank account and wondering what we going

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,960
to do next week how are we going to get

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,560
over this hump and but I'm delighted to

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,920
see that yeah we are still here but it

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,690
has been a bit of a roller coaster I'm

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,660
just gonna let us next slide Lord the

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,500
coast doesn't look like it loaded there

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,710
yeah there we go

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,930
and I have definitely

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,810
that person in the front and that person

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,750
at the back as well okay celebrating the

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,690
highs also absolutely terrified

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,060
so the intention my talk today is really

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,850
to avoid you having to shed tears that I

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,790
have shed and this is just you know

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,830
stuff that worked for us okay it might

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,200
not work for you but this is how we did

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,000
it this is how we built a wordpress

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,890
agency and this is what we concentrate

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,580
on city so five sections people process

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,350
pricing practice and party okay I'm just

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,210
going to dive straight in to people

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,290
that's the guy that I work with where

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,260
are you your hand up

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,060
love you man and Jason and I have known

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,500
each other for a long time and we work

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,950
together for a long time so I'm not just

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,280
an WordPress previously and not just an

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:15,750
agency say but I read this cool and I I

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,330
thought I'm gonna have to include that

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,720
so surround yourself with people who

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,060
meet you happy it's incredibly important

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,460
it's incredibly important that you enjoy

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,350
what you do and you enjoy the people

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,850
that you interact with every single day

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,730
and I'm not saying that life is like

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,610
that every day and our office but you

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:38,210
know what 85% of the time I would say is

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,620
we have great fun and we love what we do

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,650
it's not always been like that

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,600
he was a chart representing who did

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,710
everything when my business first

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,370
started that was me

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:54,360
I did everything then it looked like

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:57,000
that Jason and I sitting across the desk

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,490
some finish through that CSS bio me yeah

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,430
cool right newborn will do sometimes for

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,500
brilliant and today it looks like that

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,110
so there are five of us in design take

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,930
three myself Jason Danny Louie and

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,840
Levine and this graph I don't think it

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,310
accurately for trees the amount of work

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,620
that I do because I only says I can

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,780
times out there however when we break

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,620
that down into a WordPress capacity

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,510
we've got a movie that headings here are

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,520
potentially new and a slightly wrong

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,169
order but we've got a coding client

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,940
handling we've got creative we've got

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,260
front end we've got back-end dev and

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,310
we've got combined some accessibility

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,219
all inside our own agency okay

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:40,969
and we also work with the range of

00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:42,939
freelancers so we work with freelance

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,050
designers freelance SEO people

00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:48,980
copywriters devs and people that do

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:52,879
market and in PPC but for us fact is

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,620
just as important as ability okay so if

00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,329
you're a designer I would expect you to

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,470
be able to open up sketch and design me

00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:59,209
something that looks nice

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,009
all right if you're a dev I would expect

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:04,249
you to be able to solve a hard problem

00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:06,800
with some code and you know writer

00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:09,829
elegantly and adhere to standards that

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,160
we would expect so that's all almost a

00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:16,249
given for us it's more about the fet is

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,879
this person going to contribute to our

00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:23,300
team and help us grow as a business but

00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,160
it also applies to clients as well all

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,939
right and this is really important for

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,879
us okay we have to meet our clients and

00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:35,120
check that the effect with ice okay and

00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:37,160
I think this is a singularly important

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,559
thing that gets overlooked a lot of the

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,449
time client angles a few grand in front

00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,089
of your nose and you jump at it okay

00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:46,309
without doing any checks to see if this

00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:48,110
is actually going to be a good effect so

00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,850
how do we do that well it's very simple

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,300
we need them first of all but then we

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,500
think about working with them and we

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,600
check to see if they're going to take

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,290
any of these boxes I think would it be

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,470
fun

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:03,350
life's too short okay I like to joy what

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,449
I do so as this client gonna be fun to

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,759
work with are they gonna bring us Fame

00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:09,620
can we ride on their coattails as they

00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,529
go and achieve these stale are things

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,850
that they say Oh to do can we get a bit

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,519
of that are they gonna make us more

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,170
famous as an agency or let's be blunt

00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,790
about it have we got a lot of money to

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,829
spend because actually if I'm gonna have

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,470
to feel phone calls over the weekend

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,240
then I want to know that it's worth it

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,110
and actually there's n come coming into

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,269
the agency so we check the fit okay so

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,740
that's people the people around you

00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,509
whether you're a freelancer or whether

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,819
you run your own agency check the fit of

00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,679
the people around you but also check the

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:42,040
fit of the clients that you're working

00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:47,060
with because it's hugely important so

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:50,820
second thing on my list was process

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,680
come on there we go right oh oh it's

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,560
gonna skip ahead five slides though um

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,240
okay this is a company that we started

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,620
working with this year it's been quite a

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,220
big project for us I'm going to use

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,040
these guys as an example to talk about

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,180
our process that we work through

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,640
internally at design going to you this

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,980
is Edison everybody meet Edison this is

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,290
what they used to look like I grabbed

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,400
this image off the web archive the

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,380
wayback machine I'm pretty sure you

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,430
could see the rest of this fool at some

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,700
point that this is what it looks like

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:23,190
now on the web archive the mean cozy's

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,110
so currently they're developed in 250

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,300
new houses and sake and Central Scotland

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,300
and they built houses essentially for

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,180
families to yet to move into and what

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,790
did we do with them well we took them

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,710
through a foodie brand you were able to

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,290
see it for a second there and it was

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:44,730
like awesome

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:46,860
come on yes thank you so yeah I'm gonna

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,890
keep talking and we built them a

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,040
responsive website a responsive website

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:56,090
and crucially it had to be easy to use

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,160
okay that was one of the the kind of

00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,930
humans that a non-technical back-end

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,000
team had to be able to add new houses

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,950
new properties to do to the front end of

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,200
the website they had to be able to add

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,710
special offers you know so free carpets

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,360
with this one or helped by information

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,720
all that sort of information had to be

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,540
readily available and we took them

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,940
through a bit of a process that we use

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,410
that we've honed over the years to

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:28,140
really I suppose get the best out of the

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:31,290
project and how do we do that how do we

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:39,570
get from client sign on to finished

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:45,090
project okay look at that second so we

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:46,770
got four steps tour process and they all

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,710
began with Dean which is nice so we got

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:54,120
discovery design development and

00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:56,270
deployment and discovery is coming up

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,270
next

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:06,020
okay discovery starts when the client

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,120
has signed the paperwork and if you're

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,310
not using paperwork then stop what

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,700
you're doing and go and get a contract

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,250
document meet up PA lawyer to legal a

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,620
fire and make it binding okay and if

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,740
you're not doing that do that no I do

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,770
that to be it's incredibly important

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,300
that we have a clear vision for the

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,740
project right at the start that the

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,390
client understands what's going to

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,070
happen when it's going to happen how

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,710
much things are going to cost and

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,650
crucially at this point we also take a

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,750
payment okay and that is hugely

00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,340
important we normally ask for a 50% of

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,160
the project fee up front

00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,410
okay so in Edison's case we did exactly

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,810
that and we found that that Curry's the

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,680
main that sharpens everybody's focused

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:54,410
because money's changed hands all right

00:13:50,680 --> 00:14:00,290
we think that that tact works very well

00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:03,500
here we do juice and then we get into

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:06,080
some workshops with our clients so with

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,630
these guys we were branding them so what

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,670
that means for us is we are looking at

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,140
color schemes were looking at typography

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,900
we're looking at users we're looking at

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,180
all these things and we have a bit of a

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:26,030
process I would love to show you if we

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:28,250
can yes a d-33 dot il /the beeping ed

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,740
and I'm so glad I put the signs up there

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:36,890
right yeah okay and we're on slide

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:46,640
number 35 WC ed and yes or a good man

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:49,700
thank you a final yeah yeah d 33 thought

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,650
I all forward-slash that we see ed in

00:14:49,700 --> 00:15:00,610
it's a PDF you should be able doing with

00:14:51,650 --> 00:15:03,170
it from there and yeah we're struggling

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,820
struggling okay right let's keep going

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:10,640
so I'm on slide number 35 which is

00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,939
manifesto and some personas so we take

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,829
our clients through

00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:16,889
and in Edison's case we took them

00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,389
through a journey and understanding who

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,779
they are and understanding who their

00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:23,489
users are as well okay so why do we do

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,649
that well we need to we need to

00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,149
understand what the website has to do in

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:28,829
this case yeah it's pretty simple it's

00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:29,909
going to sail houses right what there's

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,979
going to be a journey through the

00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:34,439
website for each user so we need to

00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:35,789
understand who those users are and the

00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:37,559
only way that we can do that or the

00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:39,959
easiest way that we find to do is to

00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:43,259
workshop with our clients draw all of

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,149
that information out and we output a

00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,429
website at the end of this it's a

00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:51,809
discovery site and it has all of the

00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:52,979
clients discovery work on there so that

00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,989
means that if we're working with a

00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:57,569
designer the designer can reference back

00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:59,699
to the discovery site the client can go

00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:03,179
oh yeah it's the persona type that was

00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:04,619
the you know the probe divorcing or you

00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,869
know that kind of thing they can go back

00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:08,759
and they can we can look at the persona

00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:12,889
type and so we think that that works

00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:18,089
very well then we move into design know

00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:23,009
our design process is not set in stone

00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:26,220
Jason you're looking hopeful here yeah

00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:29,099
and it's worthwhile remained and our

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,379
clients and I always say this you might

00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:34,199
not fall in love with our designs right

00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:37,649
away okay you might look at them and

00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,419
think hmm I'm not sure about this and

00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,709
really it would be good to have some

00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:41,939
slides because the next few slides are

00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:46,109
paid visual because we're talking about

00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:58,589
this ain't right so come on we can do it

00:16:46,109 --> 00:17:14,539
we can do its thinking yes nobody

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:14,539
breathe come on that's progress yeah

00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:28,100
okay I think that if this isn't going to

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:31,330
work we should just sack it and it'll be

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:42,850
we can you hook min is TV instead so the

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:45,770
detriment of the captions yeah so again

00:17:42,850 --> 00:18:00,679
all right okay yeah nice one okay cool

00:17:45,770 --> 00:18:03,909
right so ah where do we go - hey okay

00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,350
you may not fall in love right away um

00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:08,659
yeah and at this point we start to

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,580
iterate designs pretty quickly okay so

00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:13,610
you can see here we've got some various

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,649
different visual routes for Edison's

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,520
logo Edison's typeface they're their

00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:21,679
word mark and we start to work through

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,870
bits of the website okay I'll come back

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,640
to why in a second but here's a home

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,409
page designer then quite make the cut

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,039
here's another completely different

00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:33,919
route that we took that was failed not

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,559
to be just quite right for Edison will

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,890
start to mock up bits of the website as

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,700
I said so this is a call to action panel

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,370
encouraging customers if they've got

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,480
questions to get in touch with Edison by

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:50,510
a either phone or by email and here's

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,950
the future of the finished website why

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,350
are we designing little bits of things

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,980
well what we found that it means is that

00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,409
when we get to the final iteration of

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,289
the website so here is the sketch fail

00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:04,610
but actually made it to production the

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,799
client already knows what they're

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,330
getting all right we've already seen the

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,210
colors they've already seen the tape

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,370
fridge there's no grand unveiling and

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,679
you wait with bated breath see if they

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,890
later or not you know there's none of

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,020
that and it helps our clients feel more

00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,330
more involved in the process it helps

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,580
our clients feel that they are taking

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,169
decisions through the design process and

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,789
there's constant feedback for our

00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:33,270
designers to learn from and to every new

00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:35,370
versions of the design so

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,040
at this point we take a premium as well

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:40,110
so clients quite happy blessed

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,020
experiment nice gets more cash into the

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:46,430
agency okay why did we take stage

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,660
payments well I suppose it just helps us

00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,070
have a bit of cash flow in the business

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,720
first of all but there may be costs

00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,370
involved with us you you might be

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,710
working with an external designer or

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,650
freelancer so you've got palin right so

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,150
staged payments taken payments at

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,570
different stages throughout the project

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,160
really really helps you manage that and

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,450
you're not having to think well you know

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,910
we're enough to make one get the money

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,530
to pay the designer for that's fine the

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,590
clients going to give you it at the

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:17,360
right point okay so what do we do next

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:21,960
well enter development and we've got

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,470
signed off visuals we then make them in

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,000
a browser I think that is pretty a

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,070
simple way of putting it but we work

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,760
with staging sites like this one so

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,890
behind a password where our clients can

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,170
log in and see our progress as we are as

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,900
we're working through the build process

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:44,180
and once we get to the stage that we

00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:46,530
have ana bros are visually the same

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:49,200
representation as the same Dorf mock-ups

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:52,500
we take another payment at that point

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,300
okay no you guys make do something

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,120
different this is just how we do it okay

00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,500
so we might mock up three keep a GC I

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,640
held up four fingers there if I say

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,930
three and four right we make before once

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,520
we get to that point

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,930
we kind of know how to build out the

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,100
rest of the site because we know where

00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,660
the header and the footer looks like

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,190
middle one each one and each two minutes

00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,530
and he looks like we know what hero

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,030
sections look like in forms look like so

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,130
we can kind of build out the rest of the

00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,500
site without too much more improved from

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,350
a designer no we found that that

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,770
approach works very well and once we get

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:28,140
to here we take a payment and the client

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,180
feedback that we get from this process

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,760
seems to indicate that they like this

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,040
bit because they can actually see the

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,840
designs come to life we can see the rule

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,630
for effects that we're using on buttons

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,080
or whole form interactions work and our

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:46,550
development process has I think it's

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,860
safe to see evolved over the years and

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:52,040
yeah I think like most of you we started

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,050
out with FTP and then we can have ruled

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,530
forward and to version control with yet

00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:59,230
and yet nowadays were continuous

00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,610
integration with Jenkins

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:05,360
Jason understands they spent much better

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:07,700
than I do that social so we are

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,280
deploying to the web we're getting ready

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,870
to deploy and what do we have to think

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,900
of it well this is a vet that a lot of

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:17,240
people get wrong we need to think about

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,790
301 redirects we need to think about are

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,350
we is this a new domain or are we

00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,780
redirect and from an old domain what's

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,550
gonna happen to all the old URLs do we

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,960
need to tell Google about any of this or

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,330
we use an analytics are we using

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,640
anything a bit more kind of you know oh

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,809
they're hot jar leads forensics or

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,750
anything like that you know what are we

00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,520
doing and are there any complicated DNA

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,050
changes that we need to think about just

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,130
know for example are we going to break

00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:45,580
Edison's email if we if we mess things

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,770
up at this stage so quite a quite a

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,600
tricky part of our project but we have

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,150
our trail list that we go through I can

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,620
a pre-flight list if you like that's

00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,290
always wrong it's always getting bigger

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,179
and being refined as we go the whole

00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:03,650
process where those things were at 9 to

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,090
12 weeks and yeah I mean it does depend

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,360
on the project some things we call

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:10,190
quicker sometimes we are slower depends

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,820
on the client anybody had small clients

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:19,220
before right yeah you know I'll give you

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:21,800
that copy by fraidy and I think really

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,600
the important thing to remember here is

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,240
if you're going to use staged payments

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,440
then it's good to think about that do

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,420
you know that there are going to be a

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,980
small client if you do then you should

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,170
maybe look at where you put your payment

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,559
stages so that you're not running into a

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:38,660
dry spell of money from their from their

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,820
project so think about that and advice

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,300
and that leads me on to number three

00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:47,000
which is pricing normally every other

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:51,260
talk that I've been to whether it's a

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,760
word camp or another Tech Talk when you

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,610
when you start talking about pricing

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,200
this happens I'm not killing you

00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,450
nobody's going to talk about it right

00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,930
particularly I have to say short corner

00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,140
with one

00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,630
okay but I run a business I need make

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,320
money and it's an important part of what

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:12,610
we do and getting our pricing strategy

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,830
right took a long time okay

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:18,890
how do you do that okay so here's the

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:22,130
kind of party line charge it normally

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:25,340
falls to me to write the proposals to go

00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:28,730
to new things to write documentation to

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,920
do research all of that has value okay

00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,420
and if you're not charging for that then

00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,460
you're messing the track because you're

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,110
giving your time away for nothing all

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,030
right and I don't know about you but my

00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,360
time is valuable I could be doing one of

00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,380
the other two things here

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,970
unfortunately it's part project work

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,280
there's quite a lot of people work who's

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,500
into the projects that we work on

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,620
there's quite a lot of reading and

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,790
understanding brief documents you know

00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,650
we have to really understand these

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,210
things when we're giving them so we

00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,460
charge for all of that project

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,520
management we charge for it builder

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,679
enter your costs promise you it's you

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,350
thing to do it's not just about design

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,720
and development there are other other

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,929
things to think of it who's heard of

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,720
this value-based pricing yeah you're not

00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:16,309
in yet I knew you have yeah okay

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,920
value-based pricing is something that we

00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,179
have tried in the past we've never

00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,800
really got it right and I'd be

00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:26,600
interested to hear from anybody that has

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:29,270
let me give you an example so really

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:34,250
really near the star of of design 33s

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:35,690
kind of suppose incarnation we started

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,880
working with an Edinburgh legal from

00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,200
quite a prestigious one there about

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,309
three hundred and fifty years old I

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,650
remember sitting in our boardroom

00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:46,190
thinking how did I end up here this is

00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:49,100
incredible and we had a system whereby

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,480
the need to produce legal certificates

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,790
if you've ever bought and sold a house

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,590
and Scotland your solicitor will have

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,350
had one of these certificates called a

00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:00,920
property inquiry certificate the charge

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,720
85 quid each for them and the process

00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,059
that we walked into was this manual

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,520
process right so person in the office

00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:09,350
generates the document then puts the

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,120
client details into their inputs the

00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,500
logo on it then make sure it's got the

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,230
right D and the right stuff in the fern

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,909
right it's taken far too long so and

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,120
they do a lot of these they do a lot of

00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:23,730
these so we were asked to build a system

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,529
that would help improve that workforce

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,509
so it's going to be IP restricted it's

00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:30,149
not publicly accessible it's just for

00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:31,169
the client so that can a cut stone or

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:33,480
and you know it doesn't have to look

00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:36,870
snazzy it can be very simple and

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,259
essentially user enters the data some

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,299
magic happens and then a brandied PDF at

00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:45,690
the other end then reality it was a

00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:48,450
wordpress site with gravity forms on the

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,340
site that the staff could see gravity

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,889
PDF I'm pretty sure is the name of the

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,200
plug-in that handles the di input from

00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:57,899
the forum and then it's split so the PDF

00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,120
at the other end they were like this is

00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:01,679
amazing guys this is incredible you know

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,210
it's gone from meeting four members as

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,240
fast to do this to one you know

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,779
fantastic so when I was putting these

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,690
slides together for work camp I looked

00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:14,850
and to date as of the from November

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,860
they've generated 19 thousand one

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,360
hundred and forty six certificates ok

00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,850
who remember it so much they were

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,000
charging their eighty five quid each ok

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:26,129
so currently as of the 8th of November

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,509
they have put through 1 million six

00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:30,330
hundred twenty seven thousand four

00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:32,700
hundred ten pounds through our system

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,789
right and anybody's that's a lot of

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,019
money okay should we have charged more

00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,850
yes

00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:42,720
should we have used value-based pricing

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:45,179
yes we got it wrong we didn't see the

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,440
inherent value we didn't understand it

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,409
because we didn't take them through a

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,639
process to help us understand what they

00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:53,399
were going to do with us and just how

00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:55,139
lucrative it was if you buy me a beer

00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,570
later I'll tell you much we charge for

00:27:55,139 --> 00:28:01,080
them for the belt but we should have

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:04,440
charged a lot more money okay we thought

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,210
about people we've talked about process

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,000
we've talked about pricing and we've had

00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,990
some technical issues in between

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,529
practice right I want you to meet

00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,230
somebody

00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:14,789
this is Emily Emily's 8 she's my

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,669
youngest daughter and she's learning to

00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:20,250
play the cornet anybody else here have

00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:25,080
kids that play brass instruments I feel

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:26,260
your pain ok yeah I say to the other day

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,610
and it she's fantastic

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,920
he's really packing off and it's great I

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,930
said to the other day you know what

00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,000
honey practice makes perfect and quick

00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,830
as a flash she came back and said new

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,840
dad

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:41,860
practice doesn't make perfect practice

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,980
makes progress and I thought that's good

00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,690
yeah I'm having that right so practice

00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,630
makes progress and I don't want to sound

00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:52,210
all preachy but there is no substitute

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,690
for practice and all of the the the

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:58,090
agency stuff that Jason and I do whether

00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,250
we are talking to people we're talking

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,320
to potential employees or potential

00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,210
clients whether we are thinking about

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,340
our process whether we're thinking about

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,620
how we have we actually complete our

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,720
project work or whether we're Lucan our

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,280
pricing why didn't we learn that piece

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,980
of work we were to experience the rate

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,910
we need to practice that again we need

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:21,220
to practice there is no substitute for

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:23,710
practicing how we handle our people are

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:27,340
we interact with our clients our process

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,620
you constantly being refined and we

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:35,800
should also go back and re-examine our

00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:37,480
pricing Awards well okay party right why

00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,490
is this in here well I thought I had to

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,930
kind of have five and then I there's a

00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,590
bit of a tenuous link in here as well so

00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:46,480
forgive me we do like to party at design

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:50,140
33 is anybody noses I'm sure will

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,570
testify to this was our agency seventh

00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,640
birthday last week an escaped room

00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,360
that's Jason and I mountain biking and

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,030
Glen dress

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,500
last year we do like to have fun

00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,080
together and this is going to turn it

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,710
back to I said ready to start we do like

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,230
to have fun and party a lot but enjoy

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,630
what we do besides that word count

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:14,850
Europe last year and here comes the

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:17,710
tenuous link I think what I get most of

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:24,220
working in a wordpress agency as I get

00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:26,680
the opportunity to participate I mean

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,540
that sincerely I think I've done I've

00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,430
done a number of different jobs and my

00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,340
time and I definitely enjoy running my

00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,860
agency it's been hard it's been hard

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,440
work and the ten years I've been using

00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,200
WordPress it's changed a lot and it's

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,290
been hard

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,120
it's not always been easy but we're

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,100
really lucky we worked in an open-source

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,900
community we get to learn from each

00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,080
other and we get to continually improve

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,850
the products we work with that's kind of

00:30:51,080 --> 00:31:04,190
it thanks for being with me through the

00:30:52,850 --> 00:31:05,990
the technical stuff brilliant yeah

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:30,800
thanks very much do you have any

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:33,020
questions for Ross as a good question so

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,340
we know the answer our project fee so we

00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:39,680
tend to charge on a project-by-project

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:41,600
basis so sometimes we get requests for

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,900
proposals and or tender documents and

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,540
and there is a fee attached to that you

00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,060
know that happens some things doesn't

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:55,190
happen always sometimes it can be quite

00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:58,670
a good way of suppose again a bit more

00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:00,920
information of your client as well so if

00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:06,950
you can phone up the client and see how

00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:09,080
much is the tenderfeet no sham indicate

00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:11,240
a budget either you know my financial

00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,620
director is winning give me an a if I

00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,290
double back to some information you know

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,290
please how many much the budget then

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,510
conversation we blow the end when we all

00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,340
if we're successful then that you know

00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,680
that this project is going to take this

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,690
amount of errors to work through then

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,380
yeah it's gonna have these courses we'll

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,250
see you later

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,250
so yeah

00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:52,669
so typically recharge 50% up front 20% a

00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:55,010
design sign-off 20% are your designs are

00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,630
known in a browser and then 10% on when

00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,980
you're safe ready for launch not when

00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,200
you say it's launched but when your

00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,289
stage ready for launch we can be really

00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,679
flexible yeah and I think you know it

00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:08,260
just depends on the clients aspirations

00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,429
their own that you know they might have

00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,650
financial milestones that we need to

00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:16,580
have to pay you you know so yeah we can

00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:19,460
be praised likes borrowing that much

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:33,440
pushback on that would start to ring a

00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:36,559
bell for me yeah yeah

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,010
at the moment we have named active

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,890
projects and in the last 12 months we

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:46,940
worked on 60 digital projects so quite a

00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:49,190
lot I am I you know I get really twitchy

00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,980
when we don't have much in the pipeline

00:33:49,190 --> 00:34:02,690
I like to have a nice flat full pipeline

00:33:51,980 --> 00:34:05,840
of inquiries interesting yeah yeah yeah

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:08,330
so um actually this year we've been

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,399
really surprised by the amount of repeat

00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,099
clients and I think it's because we are

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,290
in a bit of a space where we've been

00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:18,109
around for a few years so we may have

00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:21,290
built your website previously I know

00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:23,510
you're you're back for a new one so we

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:27,080
are starting to see an OP tech and that

00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,609
definitely yeah I think of three

00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,589
projects that we're working on just know

00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:35,679
there are four existing clients that are

00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:38,690
no again new websites yeah yeah yeah

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,399
it's actually timely that you asked that

00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:44,599
because we're looking at changing how we

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:47,480
deal with us we have various levels or

00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,919
tiers of the incidents so from somebody

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,179
that may have quite basic needs to

00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,679
somebody that needs an immediate

00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:53,750
response because their license and

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,700
system is thrown for example and their

00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,640
users can log into their safe so that

00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:02,000
can be quite challenging we use

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,700
I can have WordPress management system I

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:19,550
supposed to update multiple sites at

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:21,530
once and so on so yeah yes yes yeah yeah

00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:25,430
no seriously actually we talked you see

00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:28,849
yes as well yeah actually you know what

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:31,400
it might sound a bit philosophical right

00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:33,109
but life is very short I have two

00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,530
beautiful children you know and actually

00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:38,060
one of the things that I like most about

00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,680
running my own agency is that when DC

00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,329
that can come as school and do this

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,240
thing with us I'm like yeah you know

00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:46,070
what yes I can I can do that and running

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,230
my own agency running our agency

00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,089
together gives me the flexibility to do

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,220
that do we work too hard in the UK I

00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:54,260
think before we do you know you're on

00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:57,079
the train called home emails answering

00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,320
responding you know actually I think

00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,820
there is room for a bit of a change

00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,950
change there yeah definitely I could

00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:15,319
work four days a week yeah yeah start

00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:32,450
next week we got any more time for a

00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:34,339
student oh okay yeah so I thought we're

00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:38,240
going to get through the talk anybody

00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:40,190
mention a zoom right what are we doing

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,430
okay so I've been pretty open with you

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,470
let may be open with you again unless we

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:50,859
have been late to the party with your

00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:55,450
embark definitely and I think we will be

00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:57,680
not not not using it but we will be

00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:00,280
configuring our client sites to work

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,800
with a classic a terms I think for note

00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,560
so in the past we've used visual

00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,960
builders we've you know we've built

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,750
sites that are commercially focused

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,700
sites as well they can afford just it

00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:16,040
start working you know that the content

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,770
editors can't login and you know update

00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,380
sites so I think it's going to be

00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:24,830
challenging we're currently trying a

00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,450
bunch of stuff internally we've got an

00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:29,870
internal project that we're working on

00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:31,520
just know to really help us understand a

00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:34,430
message that we want to communicate we

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,340
are starting to get nervous emails from

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:39,650
customers you know sin I keep seeing

00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:43,880
this every time I log in you know a new

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,560
editor is coming you know well as far as

00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,500
I understand it it's been pushed back

00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,950
again right the release date so yeah

00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:54,050
yeah I think for now we're going to roll

00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,760
with the classic era but I think it's

00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,650
going to be interesting and we've got a

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,240
couple of projects that are sort of

00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,280
starting to bubble a weird I think we

00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,650
might end up building with your inbox or

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:24,230
you know they're books I think is the

00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:26,570
answer yeah definitely and I think

00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:29,090
that's something I really enjoy about

00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,760
what we do because of the size that we

00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:34,220
are we can talk about something I'm on

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,350
anything and be doing it choose the

00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,330
waves they write and there's nobody to

00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,400
see you know there's a review process

00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,990
there you know you have to pass up the

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,280
best pairs and then they have to say

00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,860
great actually

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,020
we get to the site and and that's really

00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,150
cool so if we want to start clean around

00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,600
with whether it's Gutenberg or whether

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:55,190
it's I don't know I'm mapping library

00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,680
then we can do that yeah so definitely

00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,540
one eye on the future one eye on our

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,950
clients as well making sure their

00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,850
behaviors but yeah definitely

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:05,900
Wyatt one eye on the future all times

00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:08,410
cool all right

00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,840
all right nice um thank you very much

00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,840
