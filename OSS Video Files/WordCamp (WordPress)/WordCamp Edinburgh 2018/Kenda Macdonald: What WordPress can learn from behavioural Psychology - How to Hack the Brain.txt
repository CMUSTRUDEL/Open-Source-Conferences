Title: Kenda Macdonald: What WordPress can learn from behavioural Psychology - How to Hack the Brain
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Edinburgh 2018
Description: 
	As businesses we can all too easily get focused on conversion rates… and when we become obsessed with CRO – we tend to forget all about the consumer and their needs and wants. Have we become too focused on the tech and forgotten about the consumer? I’ll share what can we learn from behavioural psychology – and how can we use those lessons to build relationships that last with the people who visit our websites. I’ll discuss how we really make decisions (and how this impacts SEO), what goes into a buying decision, and how to adapt sites and pages to make your audience more likely to convert – and stick around. We did not evolve to click around webpages – we evolved to survive – and that has serious implications for how we browse. I’ll show you how to think about how your audience thinks, and how to hack the buyer brain.

welcome to the first day of word camp

00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,790
how cool is this it is actually my first

00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,980
word camps this year so I'm really

00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,230
excited to be here if almonds fault that

00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,689
I'm here it totally persuaded me to come

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,950
and come and have a go um and today I

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:23,470
really want to talk to you guys about

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,210
what WordPress in general and people who

00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,970
are designing sites and people who are

00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,380
creating products and and anything to do

00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,360
with business really can learn from

00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,710
behavioral psychology because it's one

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,350
of those things that's not particularly

00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,030
accessible um it's kind of hidden away

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,860
under lots of posturing and loads of

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,120
jargon and so I just want to make that a

00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,980
little bit more accessible for us so

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,380
that we can make our consumers a little

00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,240
bit happier so my name is Kendra

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,970
MacDonald there is my twitter handle

00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,340
should you have any photographs of cows

00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,140
on your phone please tweet them to me it

00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,060
makes me very happy seeing cows

00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,650
especially in the morning some terrible

00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,450
in the mornings do you have any nice

00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,160
things especially Highland cars we're

00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,530
like in the right country for Highland

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,119
cars those things are awesome man like

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,490
shaggy that looked like the rock stars

00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:09,040
and cows I love them alright so let's

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,540
let's dig straight in to the biggest

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,830
problem that we're all facing as

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,390
businesses and being a business owner

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,880
myself this is something that we face

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,890
too and here's a little bit of audience

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,540
participation I know the British love

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,420
this I'm from South Africa so I'm gonna

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,460
push you guys and so what is it that

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,110
consumers actually want it's a bit of a

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,909
hard question to answer especially early

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,510
in the morning but come on chaps at me

00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:33,640
it's your opportunity to shout oh yes

00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:39,700
that's a really good one what else

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:42,670
what is it the continues yes yes oh yes

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,840
all of these things consumers really do

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,100
want only these things are great answers

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,010
by the way normally they're not that

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,320
intelligent you guys get an A+ rating

00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,970
but what consumers really really want

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,159
aside from all of these amazing things

00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,110
is to consume we want to consume stuff

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,240
and we want to do it without any

00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,710
interruptions we want to consume things

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,720
and we want to buy things but we

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,520
desperately do not want to be sold to

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,710
we want our value for money if we want

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,630
people to make our lives easier but we

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,039
don't want you to sell to us the second

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,599
we sniff that you're selling to us we're

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,430
gonna run in the other direction and

00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,959
that's like makes it a little bit hard

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,139
for businesses because what is it

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,470
effectively that businesses want we want

00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:20,660
to sell the

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,490
we want to sell stuff and that leaves us

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,230
with a bit of a problem and the Internet

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,410
has kind of enabled this problem in a

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:30,260
way because we have this divide between

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,870
what consumers want to do on the one

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,420
side here and what businesses need to do

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,130
on the other side and as the internet

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,900
enables us and as people become more

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,360
comfortable doing things the divide just

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,560
goes this way and we want to consume and

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,390
we want to do things you want to do

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,950
uninterrupted we don't want you know

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,530
like adverts in the middle of our TV

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,030
programs for 101 watch the next episode

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,710
we're going to do it right now within

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,060
three seconds I think that's what

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,710
Netflix gives you now a whole four

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,760
seconds to change your mind as to

00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,330
whether or not you want to watch the

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,530
next episode

00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,380
no whoops you're watching the next

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,870
episode right and we as businesses are

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,060
going oh all these people are hanging

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,710
out over here and I need to get my

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,780
message in front of these people I'm

00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,150
gonna buy some advertising and I'm gonna

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,100
shoehorn my way into their day and sort

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,440
of interrupting people that ain't good

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,270
right let me do it on our sites as well

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,220
you've got the person on your site and

00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,600
what do we do we throw up a pop-up right

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,250
so now you're interacting what they're

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,110
doing right when they're doing it even

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,280
when you've got their attention so they

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:31,100
ain't good and the two words that proves

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,140
this kind of thing are ad blockers if I

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,330
blockers didn't exist we could quite

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,610
happily say yeah consumers don't mind

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,320
being interrupted if ad blockers didn't

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,660
exist we could say yeah consumers love

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,220
advertising it's fine but ad blockers do

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,470
exist and consumers are getting much

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,420
cleverer with the way that they kind of

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,470
decide who they're gonna consume with

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,630
and who they're gonna spend their

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,700
precious attention on so we've got to

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,560
pander to consumers and that makes

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,630
things hard because consumers are off

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,769
they cool and they'll jump around as the

00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,030
clicker thing about Gary another

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,459
provider and that makes our lives a

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,140
little bit difficult um and in the end

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,220
like it can seem like when you look at

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,410
the stats you like alright I'm just

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,780
gonna go lie in a dark room and just cry

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,160
quietly to myself right because it just

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,590
seems like you're doing this uphill

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,430
battle all of the time so all we doomed

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,220
to fail is businesses well maybe it's an

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,989
entirely entire possibility and there's

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,360
some recent data from buzzsumo

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:27,110
on the decline of page views on

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,850
WordPress so at about May 2017 there was

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,190
a peak of the amount of page views on

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,650
WordPress and after that for the first

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,690
time

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,850
ever pageviews have started going down

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,949
right WordPress is just an easy platform

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,050
to collect that data from because we

00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:42,180
have access to it but this is probably a

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,940
global phenomenon so people are looking

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,000
at less pages then we've got some really

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,400
of the interesting data actually an

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
increase in conversion rates delivery it

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,120
doesn't matter

00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,509
oh I see oh I'll just stay away from my

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,850
slides in July there's actually an

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,100
increase in global conversion rates

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,840
right so it's now doesn't matter or

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,280
industry you and there's a slight uptick

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,039
in the amount of conversion rates so

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,930
it's very tempting to ignore the data

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,970
and the decrease in pages because

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,770
there's a big bar in here and the button

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,919
here is that in order to get that

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,539
increase in conversion rates you have to

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,360
get people to spend sixteen percent

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,160
longer on your pages do you got to get

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,930
people to spend sixteen percent longer

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,330
on your site to get the conversion rate

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,280
and they're not looking at as many pages

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,349
so we have a little bit of a problem

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,479
when it comes to how we address that

00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:38,400
with consumers and the data can be

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,620
misleading it can be very misleading we

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
can choose which bits of statistic we

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,400
like to pay attention to and you know we

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,479
can pretend for the blanket over our

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,909
head and pretend the monsters on

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,770
actually under the bed so we need to

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:52,260
spend a little bit of time figuring out

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,720
how do we get to the place that

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,360
consumers want to be while still

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,039
fulfilling our own business needs and we

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,870
need to bridge that gap and there are a

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
couple of ways that we can spend you

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,889
know spend time bridging the gap

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,880
marketing automation is one of them

00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:08,580
marketing automation is an interesting

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,650
thing though I really feel that

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,870
marketing automation needs a real and

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,870
new definition so marketing automation

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,610
as a term was coined like seven years

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,650
ago a little bit a little bit longer

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,199
back when marketing automation was

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,970
sending email campaigns okay I have

00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,590
nothing to do with WordPress at the end

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,030
of the day you can buy it a buyer list

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,699
you can send email so here we've got

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,380
marketing automation but let's look at

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,599
the new definition of what marketing is

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,210
some spreads with the two words article

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:39,570
marketing we got automation marketing is

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,880
now kind of slacking just like sales and

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,780
marketing put together because marketing

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,760
is kind of

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,040
a little bit of sales as it's gone on as

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,720
consumers don't wanna be sold to like

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,340
people have gone okay I want to be

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,139
marketed to but I'm quite happy to go

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,000
and read all of your content I just

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,500
don't want to talk to you or I want to

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
talk to you but I'll decide when I want

00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,590
to talk to you so it's no longer in your

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,350
control when you talk to the consumer

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,780
it's up to them and so marketing is now

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,130
not just the the coloring club in the

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,750
corner you know the people who are

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,370
coloring in knife things in the corner

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,590
it's now the people who are responsible

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,210
getting all the leads for sales they're

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,130
also responsible for making sure that

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,870
those sales already they're responsible

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,720
for part of the sales process and then

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,550
after that consumer is sold they're also

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,750
responsible for making sure that that

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,450
consumer sticks around

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,830
so because consumers can just go yeah

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,810
I'm bored of you I'm going somewhere

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,100
else

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,590
marketing's role is to make sure that

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,390
that person is like really happy with

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,580
the service that they're getting so

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,490
marketing is now also fulfillment so

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:42,060
marketing becomes everything that we do

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,950
to get and keep the consumer and so

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,960
that's a big role for marketing and that

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,600
changes the way that we approach things

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,790
because that means that anything you put

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,310
on your site any sale you make anything

00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,560
that you do becomes marketing and it's

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,270
impossible completely impossible to do

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,650
all of that by half you're gonna manage

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,570
all of that in spreadsheets you're gonna

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,180
get yourself into a pickle pretty much

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,010
straightaway so automation becomes the

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,020
human this is a lot of thing happening

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,660
in the screen I'm sorry my by Hannah

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,700
manager I'm sorry but it's my accent and

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,289
I think it's happier with the Scottish

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,990
accents and it is of a South African

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:17,430
accent bizarrely um but yeah you can

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,620
just amuse yourselves if I give

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,390
particular

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,400
definitely so your automation is kind of

00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,830
leveraging everything you need to do for

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,360
marketing so tada

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,300
what is your wordpress site becomes

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,240
marketing automation yeh so everything

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,469
kind of gets consumed by this you know

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,770
conglomerate the blob of marketing

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:39,570
automation now and we have to start to

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,789
bridge that gap and we have to do it in

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,190
a way that doesn't turn people off and

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:47,760
so that's where biased psychology comes

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,830
into it if we can understand why the

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,050
consumer is doing what the consumer is

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,000
doing and we can understand what they're

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,680
actually looking for and we can do it in

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,630
such a way that doesn't make consumers

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,069
defensive

00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,959
we can bridge the gap between what we

00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:02,149
need as businesses and what the consumer

00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,190
wants to do that's what Netflix has done

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:06,230
in a fantastic way you didn't want to be

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,759
interrupted Netflix said great I'm gonna

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,440
allow you to watch the full episode of

00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,970
something without adverse inside it and

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,880
I'm gonna like to watch the next episode

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,170
so Netflix has got this right we just

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,639
have to figure out how we do it properly

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,069
I'm going to take you through a couple

00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,750
of things first I'm going talk you to

00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:22,970
about click they not not I promise I

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,399
just love this title the one trick that

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,170
brains don't want you to know yeah click

00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,079
click be works for some very specific

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:32,300
reasons but it also doesn't work because

00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,220
we've got used to what click thing is so

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,600
it was a new shiny exciting thing and

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,600
then we got used to it and like a smile

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,550
same Viking anymore and so what does the

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,560
consumer actually most rely on when it

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,149
comes to make a decision some audience

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
participation think about it when you

00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:50,569
make a decision as a consumer what do

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:55,339
you most rely on yes yeah friends family

00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:57,370
trusted recommendations yeah effort

00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:01,310
require it requires Oh

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,779
hmm so here's something I may have set

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,560
you up for failure that I'm sorry and

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:08,810
but effectively what consumers most rely

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,389
on is actually rule sets we use all of

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,329
these little bits so information from

00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:16,250
everyone else information in its own

00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:17,959
like reading blog posts and stuff and

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,240
the efforts that required to make that

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,310
actual purchase we use all of this and

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,889
we build it into rule sets and and

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,529
schemas effectively so what we do we

00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,930
spend a lot of time making habitual

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:31,519
choices and that's why when you've wake

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,529
up in the morning I'm terrible in the

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,600
morning I can't even make my own tea my

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,519
husband has to make tea for me to get me

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,560
out of bed otherwise it ain't happening

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,149
I'll just be in there until it's the

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,839
afternoon and then it's okay to come out

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:46,100
and so that kind of routine of doing

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,930
things in the morning that's the

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,209
habitual pattern I've got myself into

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,769
but what's the first thing to do

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,899
despite the fact I can't make tea for

00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:56,089
myself I pick up my phone and I'll go to

00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:57,860
a few different sites and have a look at

00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,959
stuff I had to delete read it off of my

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,540
phone since I spent so much time on

00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,880
reddit that I had to be like no that's a

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,709
bad habit to get into and so I had to

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,110
train myself out of that and we create

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,930
these rule sets in order to cope with

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,490
modern life

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,070
um but it goes a little bit deeper than

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,470
that this is how we pay attention as a

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,290
rad dude called Daniel Kahneman who

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,839
created this some theory for how we pay

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,550
attention to things and it's kind of

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,170
very inventive he said that there are

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,240
two different systems for how we pay

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,650
attention to stuff system 1 and system 2

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,510
and that's what he called them

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,110
because obviously he had plus points for

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,220
creativity and these two systems explain

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,770
why we do things a little bit

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,990
differently so in order to pay attention

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,550
we have one system that is very fast

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,800
it's like immediate it happens

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,170
straightaway you don't actively think

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,570
about it we have a second system which

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:51,810
is a little bit slower it takes it

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,610
Ponder's over things um system one is

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,600
really automatic it happens is that you

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,460
think you might oh that's when you do

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,960
all your rules and and all your habits

00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,220
and all that kind of stuff when you pick

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,540
up your phone without thinking about it

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,820
and you're like how did I pick my phone

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,430
up and why am i on ready right that's

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,050
system one controlling you system two is

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,020
the module manual process so when I

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,480
asked you to work out what's two times

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,880
or fifty-two times twelve you're gonna

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,490
be like oh that system to write a lot

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,190
more manual of a process and we'd like

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,500
to like we like to refer to system one

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,540
is the autopilot we spend a lot of our

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,490
day in autopilot if those things without

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,709
us having to worry about it and system

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,370
two is our pilot these two different

00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:34,650
systems control most of our life okay

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,930
that's how we pay attention to stuff now

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,060
the best example for these two things is

00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,890
everybody in the room Drive or kind of

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,850
know how to drive or hide driving

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,839
lessons yeah right driving and it's

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,630
nodding because you're speaking about

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,670
this last night and driving lessons are

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,290
like when you're learning how to drive

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,990
doesn't it feel like the most

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,010
overwhelming thing on the planet

00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,470
especially if you learn how to drive in

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,990
the car with gears you're like wait I

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,910
have to use my feet and one of my hands

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,400
and look at stuff at the same time

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,620
that's not happening right and so you

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,060
spend a lot of time figuring out okay I

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,920
got to put the clutch in and then change

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,209
gears might just be me it took me a

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,610
while to figure it all out

00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,350
and but effectively you figure all of

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:20,250
that out and you're like oh now this

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,440
traffic oh now he's got a problem but

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,379
now you hop in your car you switch the

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,639
car and you drive

00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,139
the road and you end up the work and

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,749
you're like how did they get here and

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,729
you're driving like at least a minimum

00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:32,109
of a one-ton death machine and you

00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:34,569
didn't pay attention to how you got

00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:38,079
there it's a little bit scary a little

00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:39,909
bit scary so system one effectively took

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,099
over the process once it learned how to

00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:44,259
do something took a long time for it to

00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:46,359
put rules in place once it learns how to

00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:47,589
do something it was like okay I can do

00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,689
this you don't have to think about it

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,979
I've got this system too in the

00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:52,329
beginning had to figure out how

00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:54,129
everything worked and we had to pay

00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:55,809
attention to it now the two main

00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,220
differences between these systems is the

00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,889
amount of information they take in

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,929
system one takes in 11 million bits of

00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,129
information per second it's why you can

00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:04,479
be driving along and thinking about

00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:06,759
something else and you don't crash into

00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:09,729
everything that that's around you most

00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,099
of the time right system - are you

00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:14,349
taking 40 bits of information per second

00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:16,119
okay but is a significant difference

00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:18,549
between the two seconds between the two

00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:20,169
your system you rely and actively

00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:21,699
thought about all the decisions that you

00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:24,039
have to make during the day and you

00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:25,359
relied on that just to get out of the

00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,949
house in the morning it wouldn't happen

00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:29,529
our brains would freeze up and we

00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:31,659
wouldn't be able to deal with it so the

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,459
only reason that system one can take in

00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:36,459
that amount of information it's because

00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:38,019
it's associative it uses rulesets and it

00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,869
puts things in place and it grows okay

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,769
when I am sleepy the first thing I think

00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:44,049
about is coffee

00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,429
so when I'm tired I need caffeine and

00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,989
I'm going to make a cup of tea I'll go

00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:48,489
and make a cup of coffee and it creates

00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:50,529
those rule sets at the time we took

00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:52,929
awhile to get into that habit whereas

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,789
system two is much more intensive and

00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:56,709
effortful and it's what we like to think

00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:59,859
we spend most of our day in as cognitive

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:02,619
beings it doesn't happen right we spend

00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:04,239
85% of our day in system one so most of

00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:06,159
the time we're cruising along we're not

00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:08,919
paying attention to anything terrifying

00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,709
and I like to explain these two systems

00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,779
in terms of the minions if you haven't

00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:15,759
seen the minion movie that's your

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,939
homework to go and watch just for

00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,189
marketing purposes not for anything else

00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:22,929
but the minions basically they get given

00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:24,519
some commands and some control and they

00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:26,019
told to go do some stuff and they mess

00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,499
it up man and this is really really

00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,449
simple

00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,919
so the minions there's thousands of them

00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:32,049
they golf and they do their things

00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,449
they're controlled and created by this

00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,829
dude called GRU right who is like this

00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:36,510
criminal overlord

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,000
and

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,440
kind of controls the minions he created

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
them and they do the things that he

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,650
needs them to do so he can be the

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,750
criminal overlord couldn't be it without

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,070
the minions and so what I want you to

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,320
think about is every time you're

00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,240
creating something remember that your

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,520
consumers are more than likely in minion

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,990
mode okay so when they're looking at

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,580
your website you've got a bunch of

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,820
minions running around looking at your

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,530
site not this dude he ain't paying

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,690
attention he's only got 40 bits of

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,880
information that he can give to you he's

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,410
usually cognitive demand like massive

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,420
cognitive money is a huge amount of

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,340
calories the brain doesn't want to use

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,030
it the brain wants to use the minions

00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:17,550
right so just just keep that in mind one

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,650
thing we can really rely on is that

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,090
system one is gonna make mistakes you

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,610
haven't been so tired that you've done

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,170
something really odd like put the remote

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,720
control in the freezer but the ice cream

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,680
on the couch yeah that's system one

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,630
making a mistake

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,450
taking some rulesets and it's switch

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,860
them around we have a driven supposed to

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,920
be driving to the shops and ended up at

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,030
work being like how did I get here

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,550
that's just the one making a mistake

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,290
because it's it's made an association

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,420
it's gonna got in the car and I need to

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,130
go somewhere it must be work and because

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,590
system sugar is so tired it doesn't pay

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,470
attention to it so we make mistakes and

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,480
we call these heuristics the rule sets

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,580
are called heuristics and but we call

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,320
these mistakes cognitive biases as well

00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,450
so there are some mistakes that your

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,030
consumers will make absolutely every day

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:05,310
because they're running around in minion

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,079
mode and those cognitive biases will

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,880
affect how people interact with your

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,709
content so what we want to do is

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,930
businesses is we kind of want to focus

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,610
on system two and we want that to be in

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,670
the moment but we forget about the fact

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,829
that it's hugely demanding on the brain

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,720
and the brain doesn't want to use system

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,690
two so we've got to make all of our

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,209
usability and everything this nice

00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:30,060
pathway limit we have to make all of

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,980
that minion friendly if we can make all

00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,390
of our stuff minion friendly then we're

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,970
happy businesses because we'll get

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,980
conversions so we've learned through

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,330
different rule sets through the internet

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,280
we've all been to the school of search

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,110
no one's actually mean to the school of

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,810
search but we've all gone through the

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,300
process of becoming masters in school

00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,280
search doctorate

00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,430
and we know that when we type things

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,950
into Google and when we get to the ads

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,330
at the top of the search results that we

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,130
don't click on the loose because someone

00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,270
wants something from us right so we

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,160
scroll down and see if there's something

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,750
else relevant we don't find something

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,940
else relevant we'll go to the ads if you

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,460
absolutely have to right so we've

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,320
learned that when you click on an advert

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,550
somebody wants to sell something to you

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,810
and it's not exactly a great

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,640
relationship so you go in with your

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,470
front up but we've also learnt that when

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,600
you see a big flashy exciting banner

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,420
that has some odd words on it and you

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,040
click on it oh no I have a virus okay

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,660
we've learned that so there are some

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,580
things that we learn but it took us a

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,290
while to so we know what we need to pay

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,300
attention to because we've been to these

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,160
different schools of thought but we also

00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,770
know what we not what we shouldn't pay

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,350
attention to so here's a couple of sites

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,760
that I took a couple of search results I

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,520
took some screenshots for so this is

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,560
where and the kind of don't worry about

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,250
putting some glasses go on unfold

00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,500
through them sorry I know it's tiny and

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:51,890
the way that we pay attention has really

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,350
massive implications for SEO okay so I

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,940
search for life cycle marketing it's a

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,220
way of doing stuff and I was like okay

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,260
what comes up now there are seven

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,570
results out of the ten results that came

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,420
up that sound almost exactly the same it

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,440
starts with what is right so think about

00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,150
the fact that you've got minions

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,220
crawling over this page you're not

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,720
paying cognitive attention to it the

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,150
minions are finding the thing that

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,770
matched what you wanted to and so even

00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,510
though some of these are what is custom

00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,490
and lifecycle marketing and what is

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,950
lifecycle marketing it groups them

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,480
together because that's easy it's easy

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,890
if we group the things together so the

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,950
first thing it does is it looks at this

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,140
and goes that's the same that's kind of

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,120
the same that's the same that's the same

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,250
that's the same that's the same what are

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,020
the ones that are outliers the complete

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,450
guide to something and product lifecycle

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,980
management those are the two outliers on

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,990
this page the first thing is going to do

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,940
is find the associations and then it's

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,280
going to differentiate its founder to

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,920
differentiate is do the differentiate

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,750
and do what I needed to do and if they

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,910
do then great they'll take one of those

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,830
if the differentiate it doesn't they'll

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,960
go back to that Association and group

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,690
but it's created and gone do I trust any

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,740
of these sources so Marketo is a really

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,660
good trusted

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,370
for a lot of these things so because

00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,500
it's a trusted association it's going to

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,170
be fold for that so you've got two ways

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,400
that you can affect the way that people

00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,800
are actually gonna engage with your

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,990
content and differentiate yourself or

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,820
you can build a trusted rule set way

00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,970
people see you and they go for you first

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,530
because you get flagged up right and so

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,450
that's that search result here's the

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,340
second search result that we I wanted to

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,580
give you a real-life example here's one

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,929
that we did so this is in fuchsia piece

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,240
of software don't worry about that and

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,440
but I typed in infusions of help and

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,900
this is one of the things that we ran

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,490
from the first page and most of it's

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,140
like the Help Center then there's a

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,390
couple of service related things and

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,280
there's even some integration stuff so

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,870
we know the company abundance solutions

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,210
and we know where Schaefer and then

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,820
there's us there what we wanted to do is

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,020
we wanted to differentiate ourselves

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,730
still be really clear that were

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,800
something service but differentiate

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,570
ourselves from the two things right and

00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,940
but we didn't want it to sound like we

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:02,150
were selling at people these two things

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,630
here immediately our services infusions

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,910
of Health

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,130
what's the minions gonna do Oh in sales

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,150
run away right that's the first thing

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,920
that they're gonna think so their

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,780
grocery to that site I know because I

00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,100
know these guys that they get the clips

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,710
for they don't get conversions from that

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,900
page then we've got where Schaefer down

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,990
here and then we've got hired hired gun

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,940
solutions both of these people and it's

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,740
it's kind of really salesy the

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,570
information that's there so we were like

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,700
how do we differentiate ourselves in

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,590
such a way that we you know mitigate

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,450
some of the sales stuff still be honest

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,250
and truthful about who we are and what

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,230
we're trying to do here but provide the

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,600
information so we're like right let's

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,190
see if we can show people a case study

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,330
we can sure what other people are doing

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,530
because that's what people are

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,240
interested in they're looking for these

00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,880
users of help we get really good

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,100
conversions from that page and we know

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,870
from talking infuses our partner

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,340
communities quite open very much like

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,450
this community so we know if I'm talking

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,250
to them that they don't give your

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,650
conversions for that page and we do so

00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,480
we differentiated ourselves we made sure

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,040
that we were like putting trust in their

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,050
and we were putting honesty in their so

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,340
that people when the minion pulled over

00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,470
that page they were like yeah these

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,910
these guys are okay these guys are a

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,040
kick I'll go and have a look can we get

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,419
good traffic to that page all right so

00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,490
just remember that your consumer is

00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:14,510
minion load they're doing this all the

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,190
time they're not really

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,020
actively paying too much attention up

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,929
until the point that they really need to

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:25,280
and then they will pay that attention so

00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:27,350
you take one thing away from today it's

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,090
that your brains brains are actively

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,549
working against you not a conspiracy

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,169
they just are if they try and self

00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,400
preserve and they're gonna push you out

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:37,460
as much as possible because they don't

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,690
trust you so let's have a look now at

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,700
the other side of the coin that's

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,650
attention let's look at purchase

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,010
decisions so what goes into a purchase

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,020
decision

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,669
how does someone actually decide how

00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,160
they're gonna purchase something and

00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:51,200
there's a great bit of experimentation

00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,179
done by Dougal Brian not spurred by

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,190
Stanford University and what he did is

00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,230
he chucked people into an fMRI scanner

00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,000
and he said I'm going to show you some

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,080
pictures of products and I'm gonna show

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,790
you the price and then I want you to

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,500
press a button if you're gonna put if

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,929
you would purchase that thing with the

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,520
money that you currently have now and

00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:08,690
what he did like a whole bunch of

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,919
different products and stuff but the

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:14,059
most universal one was definitely

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,090
chocolate so chocolates most people like

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,799
chocolates it's very small percentage of

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,020
people that don't like it or can't eat

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,110
it and but for whatever reason it's

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,970
quite a universal liking mostly because

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:28,429
here's a little fun fact for you guys

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,130
when you eat chocolate it releases the

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,480
same hormones in your brain they get

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,730
released when you take certain drugs

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,320
like heroin so you know you are actually

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,510
having a physiological addiction

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,790
response when you top of it just safe

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,380
just say it's not something I eat too

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,710
much chocolate it's actually my brain

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,960
obviously that's your excuse from now so

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,730
chocolates when people saw the box of

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,260
chocolates that they wanted the reward

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,790
centers of their brain lit up like a

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,620
Christmas tree it's kind of makes sense

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,360
right you see something and we want it

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,130
our brain has to understand what it

00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,870
would be like to have that thing so it

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,850
puts us through the process of having it

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,490
and then we get a reward response great

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,950
look a little bit the dopamine hit all

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,290
exciting what's really interesting is

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,049
when they sold price when this will the

00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:14,540
cost of the product the pain centers of

00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:17,179
our brain lit up these are literally the

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,669
parts of our brain that are responsible

00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:22,370
for physical and emotional trauma

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:24,919
okay and that's what happens when we see

00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,300
the price of a product didn't matter how

00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,570
much they lowered the

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,940
price to understand price we have to

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,790
hack our brains a little bit there is no

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,610
part of our brain that evolved to kind

00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,990
of buy stuff so we're using two pretty

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,490
old parts of our brain and we're

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,470
smashing them together and in a way to

00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,500
understand what's happening in the

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,180
modern world and so we say we've got to

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,030
give something away that we already own

00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,170
that's a painful experience

00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,910
evolutionarily let's say you got

00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,560
yourself some berries now you have to

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,230
give your berries away to somebody else

00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,520
that means you could die in winter so

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,620
obviously the pain response is gonna

00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,480
kick in exact same thing happens with

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,040
money nowadays doesn't matter how much

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,320
you lower the price in order for us to

00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,630
understand price we have to emulate it

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,220
with pain okay and what they manage to

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,990
do is they manage to figure out the

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,060
likelihood of someone purchasing

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,820
something depending on the activation in

00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,350
these areas so the net value of the

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,720
products are how much that product was

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,210
worth to that consumer and how likely

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,150
they are to purchase was simply the

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,730
amount of reward that they got minus the

00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,040
amount of pain that they got so you have

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,500
to focus on getting that net value

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,270
positive so making sure that that net

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,700
value is positive and as high as

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,730
possible this is what some premium

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,220
brands do exceptionally well there is no

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:46,880
difference between the Gucci handbag and

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,860
a plastic bag not really if you put

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,390
things in it you carry it to somewhere

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,420
right that's what happens

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:55,250
but Gucci handbag is treating Gucci

00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,450
handbag or the black marketing I mean

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,250
either actually like you cheap so I've

00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,480
no idea if it's pretty or not but I've

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,030
been told that it's very pretty

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,890
Gucci handbag is pretty Gucci handbag

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,930
does all these amazing rewards things

00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,780
because the brand has really worked on

00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:11,240
positioning itself it's gone we have a

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,310
higher positioning you're gonna get more

00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,950
reward for this thing than you would for

00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,770
a plastic bag so taps into how we see

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,870
ourselves so me they've heightened the

00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,210
position of their brand and their brand

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,520
is not mitigated by the amount of pain

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:28,100
that it costs to spend money for their

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,930
target audience okay for other target

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,190
audiences they don't have the money they

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,690
don't have a lot of money it's not

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,610
floating around everywhere they cannot

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,190
spend it it's too much pain so they will

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,600
not spend the money you have a shopping

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,680
addiction on the other hand we have a

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,140
short circuit in that

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,330
system and you were directly correlated

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,040
to spending money and feeling good so

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,690
you bypass the system but I'm assuming

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,480
most of your consumers don't have

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,010
shopping addictions unfortunately most

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,070
people looking at websites certainly

00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:56,720
wins as well so every day we hack our

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,520
brains to do certain things we have our

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,710
brains to pay attention and we also have

00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,180
our brains to actually buy stuff and so

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,980
you need to focus on heightening the

00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,990
position of your brand how can you

00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,480
increase the perceived value of your

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,460
brand while decreasing perceived cost

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,530
without dropping in prices it is

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,230
dropping your prices doesn't necessarily

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:18,500
correlate to more reward if the price is

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,630
too cheap people will go something if he

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,860
is going on there I'm not quite sure why

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,780
I don't feel good about that

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,060
but it can't be as good quality because

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,740
the price is too low so there is a price

00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,910
correlation relationship that you need

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,000
to get right as well

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,310
so one of the easiest ways to hack this

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,480
to create really quality content you

00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,360
want to hide in the position of your

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,310
brand create really good quality content

00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,090
you can have on your site that people

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,440
will go

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,140
those guys know what they're talking

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,700
about that's what we want to do right

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,290
all right so bridge the gap by adding

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,660
value to your consumers this is how you

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:53,060
start to kind of create that bridge I'm

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,860
going to show you the left the ants it's

00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,900
like the end of this and everything it's

00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,190
not 42 in fact it's two things that I

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,760
want you guys to be able to take away

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,710
and so effectively it's framing frame

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,060
stuff really well it's what our brains

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,280
are desperate for so here's a couple

00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,840
examples of that framing so I don't know

00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,820
if you've seen this exam before but this

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,190
was the economists pricing structure on

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,050
their websites and so the Economist

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,020
normal the com subscription

00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:21,980
webscriptions $59 the print subscription

00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,970
is 125 dollars and if we just see $59 do

00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,010
we understand that

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,110
probably not we don't understand that we

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:29,210
have no frame of reference see hundred

00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,370
and twenty-five dollars are now we can

00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:33,980
compare and contrast the two things then

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,380
we see that the print and web is 125

00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,550
dollars that's interesting so their

00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:42,110
conversion rates 16% went from 59%

00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:45,170
0% went four hundred and twenty-five

00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:47,000
dollars for 84% going for the print and

00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,410
web together because now we can contrast

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,539
and we can see that that's a good deal

00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,399
and so you know

00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,320
as you do when you're optimizing your

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,639
website we go this is a non convert so

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,949
let's take it out it's not doing

00:28:55,639 --> 00:29:01,070
anything it's useless and we had a

00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:02,299
problem kind of a subscription at $59

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,339
and then just at one hundred and twenty

00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,629
five dollars sixty eight percent of

00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:07,729
people who I purchased the cheaper

00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:09,469
option it's not great for the Economist

00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:12,619
or hey that's not what they want

00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:13,999
32% took the higher priced option and so

00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:16,039
this is what we call coherent

00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:17,359
arbitrariness right coherent

00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:20,149
arbitrariness is when you put an

00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,879
arbitrary baseline arbitrary baseline

00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:24,440
was that the print subscription is 125

00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:26,569
pounds putting the two things together

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,190
creates a really nice baseline and then

00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:30,319
you have coherent behavior around that

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:32,119
baseline what baselines can you guys put

00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,519
on your site to frame things really

00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,829
nicely for people let us have a look at

00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:42,589
these two squares right which grains

00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:45,519
darker the one in the middle right which

00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:48,049
grains darker they're exactly the same

00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,299
so that's what framing does for your

00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:51,949
consumers it allows them to go these

00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:53,629
products are different and this is why I

00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:55,489
should choose one over the other you're

00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:57,409
looking for a darker internal gray

00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:59,139
you're gonna go for that one despite the

00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:02,269
fact that they're exactly the same um

00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:04,219
then this really comes down to implicit

00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:05,839
signals and explicit signals so implicit

00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,639
signals are understood by the minions

00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,769
that's the frame you're creating the

00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,659
positioning of your brand and it comes

00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:13,549
in and that 11 million bits of

00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:15,529
information per second right those of

00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:18,199
your implicit signals have been taken in

00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:20,029
we create these associations and boom we

00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:22,399
understand what the frame is the

00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:24,889
explicit signals like language are

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,139
understood by the screen dude at the top

00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:29,659
system number two to look at adidas

00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:31,339
dynamic Health's shower gel why is it

00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:35,149
men's leading shower gel for quite a

00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:37,069
long time in the US because of this they

00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:41,149
made their branding look suspiciously

00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:43,579
like oil right high-performance motor

00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:45,440
oil and choose the strain sheet bottle

00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:47,479
roughly the same color

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,919
they even had much closer branding but I

00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,959
couldn't find the image for that one

00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:52,699
that wasn't copyrighted they made like

00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:54,559
some little sections on this idea that

00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:56,329
were really grippy is if the shower gel

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,429
was magically gonna zoom off and do

00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:00,559
something and there's an audible click

00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:02,329
when you open the top of the cap and the

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,860
way that you open the top of the cap is

00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:05,900
the same way that you open

00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,330
the top of the oil bottle they

00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,179
everything implicitly was targeted

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,500
towards it is a high-performance

00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:15,290
motoring products gonna give you an

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,010
energizing exciting shower right but

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,830
then this happened Castrol changed after

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,720
oil it's not called for across the oil

00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:26,630
change their branding energy just went

00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,650
okay we can I go back alright and the

00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:32,450
minions like this and then you've got

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:36,410
their with cards as well Land Rover

00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:39,350
Defender my favorite car tag you are do

00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,610
the same thing get you from A to B it's

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,100
just the way that you get they're

00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,380
slightly different but effectively you

00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,650
look at their advertising everything

00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:51,740
about the Jaguar car is like swishy and

00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,530
and like all like swishy I can't think

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,540
of any other women swishy for this car

00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:58,190
and the road is all like zoomy and it

00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,110
looks like it's going fast and it looks

00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,940
exciting and it's got two exhaust pipes

00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,340
wise I mean too because because it's

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,470
fast and the mountains are exciting

00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,480
everything about this car says I've been

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,299
really fast and it's gonna be nice when

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,890
you drive me right look at this car I'm

00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:14,059
not supposed to be in water cause

00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,220
they're going water

00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,660
I saw a car go it's like literally one

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,919
of the first things they tell you not to

00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,200
do when you're driving throw and drive

00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,020
into the river right with the defender

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,540
you can and everything about the car is

00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,460
created in such a way than its boxy it

00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,160
doesn't need to be box you can be swishy

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:33,110
and Fuger in rivers but it's not it's

00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,419
foxy all the signals or screaming at you

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,860
I have a very specific purpose then

00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:38,480
brave the breath the framing is

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,669
exceptional I mean look at cognitive

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,530
effort this is the big thing when I want

00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:44,900
you guys take away your websites are

00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:47,809
hard to use does anyone ever done the

00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:51,200
Stroop test yeah this thing's a total

00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:53,120
utter busted hate it did it a lot in

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,150
university do you supposed to read out

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,640
the color not the word and now we have

00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:02,090
system 1 and system 2 fighting so it's

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,220
just the ones going I'm I'm green I'm

00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,200
green I'm green and system choose doing

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,210
no but it says blue and the two things

00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,070
are trying to override one another when

00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,750
you start this process it's really easy

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,640
in the beginning because you're like

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,650
yeah I can pay attention further done

00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,320
you get the harder it gets and the more

00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,299
mistakes

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,049
make okay that's what you're doing with

00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:22,740
your website when you don't make it easy

00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:24,179
coincidentally if you need a Christmas

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,880
present for someone who likes wearing

00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:30,149
this is a great game and it uses the

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,639
same principle and the more alcohol you

00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:34,470
drink the more system one takes over

00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:36,480
just by the way so you're doomed to fail

00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,340
the drunker you get with this game just

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,980
saying not from personal experience or

00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,169
anything and but this is an example of

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,730
the street test in function you're going

00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:47,100
to look at your site and go is that what

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:50,250
I'm doing so we need to kind of hack the

00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,590
brain need to ease the cognitive demand

00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,750
on your websites make it easy and then

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:57,330
also control the frame here's the

00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,860
questions for you guys go away and look

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,419
at the sites that you're creating look

00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,519
at your products look at absolutely

00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,950
everything and say to yourself what am i

00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,139
implying on this site the color choices

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,760
the language that you're using the the

00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:10,829
positioning of everything the images

00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,329
behind it what what do you what are the

00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:13,560
what are the implicit signals that are

00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:15,540
you're giving to people and is it

00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,980
wouldn't what and then what about the

00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,569
explicit stuff you know what are you

00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,909
explicitly saying in your coffee and do

00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:22,649
the two things match um are you

00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:24,210
controlling that frame are you saying to

00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:25,889
them this is what I want you to think of

00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,109
and are you actually controlling that

00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,760
properly or is it controlling you and

00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,379
are you focusing on continually

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,270
increasing your net value so you're

00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:35,579
giving that reward and taking away some

00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,710
of the pain where possible and is it

00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,480
really cognitively demanding now a great

00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,220
test for this since being asked last

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,839
night by Edie how do we actually use

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,639
their good test lack give you a

00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,230
grandmother to use your site someone who

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,810
doesn't know how to use the Internet if

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,060
your grandma or your mom or somebody

00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,919
who's totally not techy can use

00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,260
something with doing a great job its

00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:58,290
minion friendly they can't use it you're

00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,060
in trouble right so understand behavior

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,460
understand how your consumers are

00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,950
thinking anticipate their needs and then

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,690
validate it with your data make tests

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,819
and don't just go okay that's a good job

00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,619
and then wonder why your monetary values

00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:12,150
just like drop through the ceiling and

00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:15,240
you're missing 43 percent of your

00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:17,310
profits like The Economist did um now

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,900
because you guys are here you're more

00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,420
than welcome to get a free copy of my

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,490
book which I have the little golden

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,170
tickets for which is on all of the stuff

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,550
you're more than happy to have it just

00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,640
come and grab the gold ticket or you can

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:36,869
go to that URL alright

00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:39,839
hey guys thanks so much Kendra

00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:42,359
um so we got time for maybe two or three

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,529
questions for Candace tonight if you

00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,529
just want to raise your hand yeah

00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,150
anchoring so the nineteen thousand pound

00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,130
option is exactly the same as the one

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,720
thousand seven hundred pound option it's

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,700
just that the 19 thousand pounds is

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,769
being paid so that is actually cognitive

00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,329
bias called the anchoring effect so the

00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:12,269
first price that you see since the

00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:14,430
baseline this is why putting cheaper

00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:15,900
price is a really bad idea don't do that

00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,910
because that sets the baseline for

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,410
something if you want somebody to choose

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,210
something for that option in the middle

00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,920
anchor it with a slightly higher price

00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,420
and then go further and down does

00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,279
anybody take us up on a nineteen

00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,079
thousand pound option no that's not what

00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:30,180
it's there for if they did I'd be like

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,289
hell yeah that's really cool but that's

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,690
not it that's all what it's there for

00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:36,539
it's a it's a fallacy price effectively

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,769
to get people to realize a one thousand

00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:39,210
seven hundred pounds is not actually a

00:36:37,769 --> 00:37:04,890
tight expensive and then there's a

00:36:39,210 --> 00:37:07,259
cheaper price behind that as well don't

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:09,359
ever just go from one way so go the

00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:11,400
other way as well and then so you can

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,109
say to people and so double-blind test

00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,730
is just people don't really know which

00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:15,960
option are getting and the person who is

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,079
giving the options doesn't know which

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,819
options being given and so get somebody

00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,619
who knows a little bit about psychology

00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:23,670
to put that together that experiment

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,680
together for you if you're gonna

00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,569
experiment with it but you generally say

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,099
to people give them the higher price and

00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:31,170
then come down the bin start the other

00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,480
way and grow up and then also ask them

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,160
to name a price and then try and try and

00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,599
get an average and aggregate between all

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,170
of them will give you the best option

00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,170
you know

00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:47,739
and if you've got a focus group

00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:49,180
you'll get one every time it is that

00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:50,619
paid to be this you give that answer

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,450
I don't like focus groups for that

00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:54,910
reason and so they're gonna tell you

00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,680
what you want to hear and so what I like

00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,690
to do is I like to take a small group of

00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,729
customers people who are already

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,559
existing customers and you ask them and

00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:05,019
we feel the pricing is relative to the

00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,969
service that they've got so rather than

00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:09,099
asking them what they pay take that

00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:10,509
experience and go is the price worth

00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:12,670
experience or would you pay more for

00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:14,680
would you pay less and see how they feel

00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,059
fit you can take trust approving people

00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,890
who are gonna be honest with you I'll

00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:19,569
give you an honest answer most of the

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,249
time if you're offering or really I mean

00:38:19,569 --> 00:38:22,599
like we've always been told by all of

00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:25,660
our customers we need to charge more for

00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,219
what we do I'm not gonna but that's what

00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,859
they say to us and that's why we've got

00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:31,479
our pricing to where it is and so if

00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:33,369
your consumers are all telling you you

00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:35,410
need to charge more you need to charge

00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:37,900
more because you are actually under

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,640
minding that reward relationship because

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,369
you're undermining it with the custom of

00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,709
the event itself or the product itself

00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:46,299
with that baseline you're kind of Saints

00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:48,459
people if not as valuable as if it was

00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:50,499
higher so there is a there's a line to

00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:57,309
prove that I like to do it from the

00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:58,449
experience okay yeah Kent you'll be

00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:02,949
writing for the rest of the day yeah I

00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:04,839
guess so if you do brilliant so if you

00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:07,630
do come up with anything afterwards that

00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:08,769
can they'll be here to bounce back can

00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,170
we have another big hand for Canada

00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:12,300
please

00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,300
