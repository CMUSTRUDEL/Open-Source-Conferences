good morning everybody welcome to Santa

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,939
Clarita I'm Tanya Mallory and I'm the

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,200
owner of steam work here in Santa

00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,590
Clarita it's a community of

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,599
entrepreneurs who have banded together

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,040
and word press plays an important role

00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,450
in our story and so during the course of

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,090
today I want to talk to you about why

00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,620
WordPress why have I been using

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,840
WordPress for nine years to grow my

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,550
business how to find your first paying

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,590
client with WordPress because I was

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,260
hearing that a lot last night from some

00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,030
of the people I met at dinner and then

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,330
how to grow a WordPress business from

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,130
that and then how WordPress powers our

00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,000
community here in Santa Clarita it's

00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,670
teamwork as Joe mentioned this morning I

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,160
met him at our Public Library because I

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,079
was hosting WordPress meetup which was

00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,759
handed down to me from another gentleman

00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:11,380
he had moved to Las Vegas and I decided

00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,689
that this would be a great way to find

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,049
people in the community that would be

00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:19,329
able to potentially become clients that

00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:23,170
was one of the ideas but also become

00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:25,359
resources to our growing agency and may

00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,329
want to get involved in our business

00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,479
community as we were starting to grow

00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:34,929
steam work and just a little bit about

00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,789
me I had a big old corporate career back

00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,530
in New York it was an investment banker

00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:40,840
then I worked for MasterCard for 10

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,990
years pioneering lots of mobile commerce

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,810
product development so if you guys seen

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,840
the Apple card so a lot of the

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:53,409
infrastructure and tokenization of the

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,590
the card number was that was part of my

00:01:53,409 --> 00:02:01,299
legacy at MasterCard and I moved out to

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,560
Los Angeles 12 years ago to work for a

00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,109
start-up and the timing was very

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,539
interesting it was the week that the

00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,700
iPhone came out and I was we had left

00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:11,560
this amazing job to move my family

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,709
across the country for a VC funded

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,650
startup which lasted nine months right

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,650
before the crash and so what happens

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,780
when all of your plans kind of fall out

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,210
underneath you well you try to figure

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,650
out what are your skills and how do you

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,220
put the

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,379
work now at the time I had no skills in

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,470
this area I had done product development

00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:38,939
and project management and IT Enterprise

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,099
IT products but I hadn't done that

00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,200
necessarily for local businesses but I

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,560
started to train myself and my first

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,260
client has somebody was saying yet last

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,819
yesterday that they got $200 for the

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,819
first paid website and I was like oh

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,239
that's so sweet how nice I was so lucky

00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,769
because my friends were consultants and

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,599
they gave me nine thousand dollars to

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,879
update their site and I was like wow

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,400
okay that sounds like it could work

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,340
I won't figure that out for $9,000 right

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,040
and so that's when my freelance career

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,840
began and I started to I think it was a

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,430
dotnet framework and I had to get in

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,409
there and make changes to his site and

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,260
and figure it all out and then I was

00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,000
like there must be an easier way so I

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,650
started investigating the tools that

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,689
were available at that time I was

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,909
looking at Joomla and Drupal and the

00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:31,319
very beginning stages and then over time

00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:33,629
I found WordPress and I fell in love why

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,549
did I want to have a more like instead

00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,919
of jumping back into corporate why did I

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,530
want to kind of go down this path well I

00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:44,310
had during my tenure at MasterCard I had

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:47,040
three children and my three boys now are

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,319
teenagers right but at the time they

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,760
were two four and six and I had just

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,129
moved my entire family across the

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,979
country to have a better work-life

00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:59,069
balance and I was determined that I

00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,720
would have it now so I definitely poured

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,440
my heart into learning this and

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,940
mastering it as best as I could over the

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,069
course of time though I've also

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,919
supplemented my WordPress business with

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,019
being a start-up advisor and marketing

00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,310
resource so I'm into growth marketing

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,340
growth hacking if you've heard those

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,849
terms and I also teach digital marketing

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,320
and app design at at USC for the last

00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:27,090
seven years so that's a little bit about

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,710
me by the end of this session my goal is

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,539
that you guys get to tap into your

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,280
superpowers and figure out how your

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:34,740
background can actually help you grow

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,020
your agency right so do you feel like

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,969
you have superpowers now that you know a

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,749
little bit more about WordPress where

00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:42,330
does that sound like

00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:45,119
we have a long way to go today we have a

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,279
long way to go I am Telling You that

00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:49,469
WordPress is a superpower but also

00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,119
combined with your natural background

00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:52,879
and superpower you have way more

00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:54,449
credibility then you're probably

00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,289
yielding today

00:04:54,449 --> 00:05:01,049
wielding sorry yielding wielding today

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:03,449
my kingdom for a dongle I love it

00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:12,929
guy is a professional pack I'd have to

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:15,269
say okay right I know I usually travel

00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:20,579
with me I'm gonna just pack an HDMI

00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:23,189
everywhere I go so nine years ago I left

00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:25,679
a secondary corporate job I had at a

00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:29,699
digital marketing agency and the Omnicom

00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:31,139
family to start my own company and that

00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,199
was the birth of what is now called

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,269
steam work and our anniversary is the

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,699
14th of April so I'm like literally on

00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:41,219
the cusp of that and we've built dozens

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,769
of WordPress sites for small businesses

00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:47,369
big businesses nonprofits schools and

00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:52,589
startups literally everybody who has any

00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:55,289
type of commercially facing organization

00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:58,110
needs of a website and WordPress is an

00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,819
excellent choice for that and then I

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,399
told you a little bit about Steamworks

00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,629
so why WordPress and these are this is

00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,089
where I wish you could see these

00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,039
beautiful slides but I think that

00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:11,489
WordPress provides a tremendous value

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:13,589
for clients first of all with it the

00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:15,389
plethora of creative themes and if

00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,459
you're a designer forgive me but I do

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,209
love relying on a theme when the budget

00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:24,300
is important that it's so customizable

00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:27,089
powerful flexible and functional with

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:30,149
its super SEO and it's easy to find

00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:32,819
support I think one of the things that I

00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:35,719
don't love about the ethics of our

00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:39,149
industry is when developers are

00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:42,149
wordpress shops or try to lock down the

00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:44,489
site so much that the the end-use

00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:46,459
customer doesn't have control over their

00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:49,769
sites I find that to be really a

00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:51,160
challenging ethical dilemma because

00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:53,830
really it's been

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,040
set for the business and it for my

00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:01,920
philosophy respecting the rights of the

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:05,080
client is always paramount and so the

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,880
freedom that WordPress can give to that

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,070
client is that if they are working with

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,350
somebody that's not great they can go

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,510
and find someone much more easily who

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,240
can better support them and work within

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,580
the ethical framework that is needed to

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,550
rescue project right so how many of you

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:25,000
have worked on rescues before oh yeah

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,250
right so being that good actor in a sea

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,170
of maybe not so great actors can be a

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,090
really good positioning because people

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,390
do need help and support people do

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,310
disappear and oh man I have we could

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,250
talk at your Conan later about all those

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,410
stories the other thing is just

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,540
WordPress is super easy to pitch to

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,610
clients they've heard of it right which

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,270
is always a win it doesn't sound foreign

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,880
to them and it powers 30 percent of the

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,940
inner Internet everybody needs it and

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,550
most websites are kind of crap right so

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,590
they lack focus they're designed badly

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,600
they have no objective they don't work

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,030
well on mobile devices so you can kind

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,960
of spot a bad website easily and then be

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,550
able to pitch a better option to them

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,320
and the thing is especially when you're

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,840
starting it's important to remember that

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,610
just because you think WordPress is easy

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,560
doesn't mean your clients do they are

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,410
still completely overwhelmed with the

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,810
technology and you are the expert you

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,360
can position yourself as very valuable

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,940
to this business you can be their

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,410
hand-holder and I like to call it the

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,140
website whisperer

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,570
right because what you do is magical to

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,849
them they have no idea how it's

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:41,099
happening behind the scenes but you also

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:47,220
have a obligation to treat that power

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,220
wisely okay here we go yes

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,089
the other thing is WordPress is extra

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,899
profit for you if your accoding all

00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:58,699
these websites from scratch oops okay I

00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:03,860
hope strike that from the transcription

00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:06,500
there was a naughty word okay so you can

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,410
get more done faster you can get paid to

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,149
not only to design and develop it but to

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,680
maintain it which if you're not doing

00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:16,279
maintenance contracts and you're leaving

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,500
money on the table you can get paid to

00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:23,600
build continuous content and to have a

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,100
content factory on your agency and you

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,810
can also get paid for custom

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,230
enhancements your customers can stay

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,720
with you for multiple years right always

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,519
upgrading always enhancing staying on

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,550
maintenance needing more content all the

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,680
time you can become a trusted adviser

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,690
and then get paid to do other projects

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,279
get involved with their marketing and

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,100
get involved with their strategy get

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,079
involved with their advertising but it

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,220
kind of started with that get the foot

00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,240
in the door

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,560
WordPress project is this resonating for

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,810
you guys so you do someone that's -

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,760
that's this guy's like I could give this

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:04,100
talk let's go chat okay so the last

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,889
thing I would say is in the why

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,370
WordPress category is kiss you know the

00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:12,949
kiss strategy I not the band right man I

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,779
like to say keep it simple smarty cuz I

00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:17,870
don't like calling people names but

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:19,940
that's okay but keep it simple smarty

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,579
don't be greedy don't try to get the

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,880
entire like year-long budget crammed

00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:29,360
into one project you'll overwhelm them

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,459
you'll lose the contract get paid

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,970
quicker by doing the basics first so in

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:36,920
spend startup lands you have the concept

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,290
of Minimum Viable Product if you guys

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,439
heard this term before it's called MVP

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,860
and as in Mary P as in Victor P as in

00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:48,470
Peter minimal Viable Product so get

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,589
something simple done for them and then

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,839
talk about phase 2 phase 3 phase 4

00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:55,279
because it helps them understand that

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,410
you're not trying to take advantage of

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,660
them that you're trying to get the

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,190
important things

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,860
taken care of first and that you can

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,350
always you know make enhancements and

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,199
work and grow with their business it it

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,600
offloads a lot of the risk upfront from

00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:15,459
this project in this relationship and it

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,490
gives you a steadier pace for work as

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:21,310
well as a steadier pace for income right

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,639
so I think the temptation is well let me

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,009
get the big big projects upfront but

00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:34,959
that's not necessarily the way to

00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:36,610
maximize your income okay tada so based

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,490
on that how to find your first paying

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,560
WordPress client yesterday conversation

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,079
update your sales marketing and delivery

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,720
so first of all you should have a good

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,029
WordPress website at a minimum right

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,279
because people will check you out your

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,250
site is your 24/7 marketing sales

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,870
department and you're also going to be

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,060
telling your clients that their website

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,550
is there 24/7 marketing and sales

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,100
departments so if yours isn't working if

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,620
the links are broken if contents

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,959
outdated if your picture looks nothing

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,209
like you today and you've got some

00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,860
things to update so I would really make

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:13,269
sure that you spend a little time on

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,069
that and book out some time in your

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:19,120
calendar on a regular basis to keep that

00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:25,300
up to date and have the content flowing

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:28,209
regularly what website must have oh this

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,189

right here this blue screen okay you

00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:36,639

00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:39,550
right website must-haves you should have

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,649
case studies client results right how

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:45,220
have you improved your clients

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:47,319
businesses and testimonials

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,910
what are your clients say about you have

00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,250
they left reviews anywhere have you

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,170
asked them for testimonials how you ask

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,110
them to give you feedback on your

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,670
project even if they wrote you a letter

00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,980
saying oh thank you so much our new

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,050
website is great asked hey do you mind

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,089
if I put that on my website and put a

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,850
picture of your site and a link back to

00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:09,130
you and that way we keep promoting each

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,740
other and we keep supporting each other

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,580
so the deeper you make those links the

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,980
better off

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,230
you're you'll be in developing your

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:21,370
community of customers that can help

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:24,160
advertise your business if you've gotten

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:27,670
good press awards or other trust marks

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,290
like maybe you've you've done an article

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,180
in The Huffington Post or something like

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,930
that well make sure you keep adding

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,420
content to your site if you have been

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,130
names like entrepreneur of the years and

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,839
I can't remember with anybody a word

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,310
list I want a couple years ago and now

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,110
I'm thinking that's not on my site

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,050
what's wrong with me you should have

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,750
that kind of stuff on your site because

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,839
that enhances people's trust and that

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,339
you're a good good at what you do but

00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,510
also a good person you've been

00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:00,339
recognized by people they trust the

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,290
other thing I would recommend is talk a

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,120
little bit about the process what should

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,550
they expect when they don't go to work

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,279
with you how does your process work do

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:12,660
you have a discovery session with them

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,279
do you then go into design phase do you

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,020
you know then go into development phase

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,750
talk about the phases of your project

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,339
one thing I've found is that people who

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,740
are especially people who are on the

00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:27,579
technical side of WordPress they tend to

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,529
overwhelm clients with the technical

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:33,610
steps and I would encourage you to not

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:35,560
use jargon not confuse them if you're

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,300
working with local businesses

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,660
particularly and you throw a wireframe

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,490
at them they literally have no idea what

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,709
that is and they're like why are you

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,959
giving me boxes this is not a website I

00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:49,240
want a website right and so it takes a

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,589
lot of Education but if you show them

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,720
pictures of here's what I'm gonna do

00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,700
first here's what I'm gonna do second

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,649
here's what I'm going to do third this

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,350
is what it means this is the feedback I

00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:01,390
expect from you at each of the stages of

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,520
the process the clarity of your

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,839
communication will make them feel

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,709
comfortable and they won't feel

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:12,449
surprised or under duress so I was

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:14,740
working with one of our local WordPress

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:16,540
resources here in town and we are

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,360
working with a local cake shop and this

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,120
woman is fabulous she's been in business

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,680
for 40 years unbelievable right at

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,300
business success story

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,640
and we were really excited to do this

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,839
website for her for her anniversary and

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,430
she's been through a few different

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,960
prospect you know prospective firms to

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,490
work with and she finally was like we

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,610
feel really comfortable with you guys

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,200
but it she gets overwhelmed when you

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,000
present something that's just too much

00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,980
for her or you ask her for too much

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,529
content at the same time or too many

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,200
pictures or or present something that's

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:53,510
unfamiliar she that she's just not able

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,980
to process it in the scheme of all the

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,500
other things that she has to get done in

00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,380
her business and so being really careful

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:05,000
with how you dose out the updates and

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,370
the content requests makes a big

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,080
difference and also make sure they can

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,080
contact you that should be on your

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,839
website I know that seems really like a

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,180
dumb thing to say but such a big mistake

00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,600
I see people make is if they cannot get

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,720
to you if you have no phone number email

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,820
or web form people can't figure it out

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,200
they move on they go to the next the

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,720
next person they find in their Google

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,240
listings right so make sure they can

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,040
contact you so those those items are

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,930
trust builders and knowledge builders

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:43,459
and they are laid out on the slide very

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:45,770
nicely okay glad I did this and thank

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:47,300

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,740

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,080
right there's gonna change the

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,600
conversation when you stop thinking

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,670
about a while I just need the money and

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,430
I need the day of the money so I need

00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,900
the money so let's talk it has nothing

00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,460
to do with the money it has to do with

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,550
the value you're delivering to the

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:25,400
business and how their customers are

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:27,860
going to find them and and become deeper

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,160
longer-lasting fixtures in their

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:34,700
business so let's get good at service

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,730
not sales right let's express our value

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:41,720
in a different way okay the next thing

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:43,340
is make sure in the the process it isn't

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,340
about like I said selling it's about

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,440
asking questions good questions to ask

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:53,060
is what's a good client works for you

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,340
why because you can really get a lot of

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,830
information about what their budget for

00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:02,420
their website might be okay and here's

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:05,300
why what if they are an oncologist and a

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,070
good client is worth you know fifty

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,090
thousand dollars a year to them I don't

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,710
know what that number is right I

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,420
actually haven't done an oncology site

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,420
but we're just pulling something out of

00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,270
the air more okay here you go

00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:22,400
how much is a good website worth to an

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:25,320
oncologist to get one more client you're

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:30,060
worth at least $100,000

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:34,200
okay so should they pay more than $2,000

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,730
for a website very good okay good answer

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,920
good answer now we're good now we're

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,750
talking how about a lawyer what's I

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,580
don't know a general litigator but

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:48,090
what's a good client worth to a

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:50,820
litigator do you think that a lawyer

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,680
should pay you know at least a fraction

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,420
of one good client what if they got one

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:59,130
more good client this year because they

00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:03,270
improve their website at least at least

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:05,670
okay so so what if it's a different type

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:08,520
of price like it's a restaurant a burger

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,560
shop or a restaurant now they add a very

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,870
dependent on having a steady flow of

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,640
traffic right they need really good

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,920
search optimization they need really

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,390
good access to their menu maybe some

00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:23,430
ordering it could be more complicated

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:26,070
what's a good day or a good week worth

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,840
to restaurant what if they didn't have

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,490
that good day or didn't have that good

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,190
week what happens to restaurants when

00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,440
they don't get the traffic we've all st.

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:38,100
now in Santa Clarita we have a foodies

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,900
group on Facebook and restaurants go out

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,660
of business literally every week right

00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,000
so a restaurant is really dependent on

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,430
having excellent marketing from day one

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,720
get butts and seeds get people in the

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:54,000
door they need high-throughput of those

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,620
tickets to get written so what's a good

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,630
client worth to you is a really

00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,930
important way of getting to the value

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,210
that's in it and stacking the value

00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:07,860
story for the client it's like what if

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:09,600
you could use this right and it was

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,760
attracting more clients to you what if

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,760
it got you one two three more big

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,560
clients what if it got you on ten more

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,520
good days in a year what does that mean

00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,490
to you and that's a way of getting out

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,380
of the lowest price bid conversation and

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,930
into the this is how it's going to help

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,520
your business conversation what's the

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,410
main job this website needs to

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,740
accomplish for your business especially

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,630
going back to that MVP conversation a

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,950
website especially when you're doing the

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,750
FIR

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:44,570
project needs to go to one single focus

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,370
what is the outcome you want and then

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,250
the other things can be added in but the

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,600
singular drive to the end focus is it

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:57,920
getting a lead is a selling product is

00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,980
it getting to the point where they're

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:04,190
making a an appointment right have one

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,950
singular objective and that website that

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,990
is the the primary focus get that chunk

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:12,440
done first and then add other things to

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:14,540
it so that you really get them to admit

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,910
that upfront is super important and if

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,580
they get that you actually help them

00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,560
prioritize that way you've just added

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,600
tremendous value to their business and

00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,700
then also ask what they like or dislike

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,280
about your current about their current

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:31,130
site many do have a website and many do

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,020
you have a bad website so you can see

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,200
what they've had and what worked and

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,700
what didn't work and then also

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,310
inspiration sites like the sites in

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,540
their industry or sites businesses

00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,670
they've noticed that they really like

00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:48,460
the design of or they really like the

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:52,430
functionality of and always be listening

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:55,520
objections are good objections in the

00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,740
sales process means they're engaged it

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,750
means that they're still deciding I

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,540
think that they haven't said no yet in

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,700
their mind objections mean that they are

00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,770
sorting through their own priorities and

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,200
there's something else bothering them so

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:12,170
ask about the real concern behind the

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,400
objection is it if it's a time objection

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,530
you know what what is it about the

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,510
timeline that is still bothering you

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,000
what is it about the price that's still

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,220
bothering you what is it about the the

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,370
content limits that maybe somebody else

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,170
was putting on you that you find

00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,240
objectionable how can we figure out a

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,830
way around that and if you can get

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,530
through their objections you have the

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,480
business if you care about understanding

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,240
and addressing the clients need more

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,090
than you care about making a huge like

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,610
maximizing the first sale you are going

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,440
to have this business then you can agree

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,650
on a scope price and timeline for that

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,720
first phase that works for us everybody

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,429
today

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,169
oh yeah my fonts or not it's okay it's

00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:57,460
good good

00:23:55,169 --> 00:24:01,139
when in doubt write or run around look

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,139
how beautiful they were okay

00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:10,389
okay so protect your scope scope creep

00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:13,330
is like my number one enemy in WordPress

00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:15,519
projects right because people have ideas

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,100
every day because it takes time to build

00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,080
a site and so really explaining to the

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,909
client upfront that the clarity of

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,129
what's in the scope of this first

00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:27,279
project and what is not it's super

00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:30,190
important to define upfront and having a

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,039
process for adding scope which you know

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:35,830
in enterprise software Leon scope creep

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,070
is the big term right you have to have a

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,289
firm sense of what's in scope what's out

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:44,529
of scope what's an additional project or

00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:46,419
an additional piece of scope and then

00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:48,159
you write up another little sheet and

00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:50,379
say we're adding this scope it costs

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,210
this much money you get them to sign off

00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:54,220
because if you just keep adding things

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:57,490
and try to build them at the end okay

00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:01,659
okay how does antara it's a rain of fire

00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:04,539
I don't I don't have advised that and

00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:07,629
this helps you to guard guard your

00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:10,299
team's value and time so that you're not

00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:12,850
off doing all these tangents and I call

00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:14,980
them ad goat rodeos right you just don't

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,259
want to be involved in that you have to

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,360
really even if it seems like it's an

00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:21,759
emergency even if it seems like it's the

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,019
last thing you have to be in control of

00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,610
this client relationship and explain how

00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:31,240
this can work now I'm not saying don't

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:34,240
be flexible don't be helpful but charge

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,059
for your value and definitely get

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,679
approval in writing and always be

00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,960
testing now this goes for your own site

00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,960
always be testing your own site but also

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,360
their site because one thing that goes

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,070
wrong at the you know as you're going to

00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,750
launch it and suddenly lost all

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,340
credibility you just work super hard so

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,360
make sure that you have a good testing

00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:57,690
process at the end frustrated come talk

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,690
to other

00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:08,999
is always be good our check

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,730
when somebody's talking about them

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,410
online congratulate them or warn them

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,940
hey you've got a bad review how can we

00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,920
address that let's talk about reputation

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,440
management let's see if there's another

00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,420
service we can help you with and

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,280
proactively respond and the other piece

00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:41,410
of always be googling that's kind of fun

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:43,000
is once I was referred to the retirees

00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,370
group for Lockheed Martin called the

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,600
star dusters and this was super fun it

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:52,660
was you know a board of a dozen retirees

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,670
average age 70 but all engineers can you

00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,100
imagine right the amount of detail

00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:59,470
questions they had for me and we're

00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,420
sitting around and a board style table

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:04,059
and I'm explaining WordPress to them

00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,130
which you know this is not rocket

00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:08,020
science but if you know it's something

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,900
that it takes a little bit to explain

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,730
and one guy's on his computer the whole

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,650
time and he's typing and typing and I'm

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,780
wondering like what's up with this guy

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,670
he seems so disengaged but everybody

00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,620
else is asking awesome questions and

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,500
about halfway through the meeting he

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:27,309
goes wow I'm on page 10 and I haven't

00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:30,250
found anything bad about you yet the

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:32,530
humans live searching for me and my

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,470
company name while I was interviewing

00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,540
with them and that is that is the world

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,100
we live in now I did get the job so we

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:43,270
think the clients for several years now

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,190
now they're a virgin 75 and we're still

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:48,610
doing enhancements for them they have a

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:53,200
massive membership site and it's using

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:55,630
woo commerce and remember so it's just

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,530
it's really important that you keep your

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:02,320
online reputation clean and make your

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:06,550
proposals simple how many of you spend a

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,890
lot of time on proposals like massive 15

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:11,290
page documents do you have you ever

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:14,160
watched your customers flip through your

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:19,270
proposal where do they go

00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:21,670
the price they don't care about all that

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,880
stuff you wrote they really really don't

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:27,340
so we're really overdoing it I would say

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,730
have a you know what to expect documents

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,170
and

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,960
and have a good contract a good

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:35,530
agreement but all of that work to do

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,080
fancy beautiful proposals simplify and

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,880
streamline as much as possible because

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,010
they just don't care if they've seen

00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,500
good samples of your work if they know

00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:46,930
you they're hiring you and your team and

00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,540
you as a trusted advisor they're not

00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,790
hiring your ability to create a 15 page

00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,650
document I promise you and you're gonna

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:57,300
be terrified the first time sent out a

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:59,830
streamlined proposal but when you win it

00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,660
and when they appreciate the clarity

00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,120
with which you delivered it you're going

00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,800
to thank me later and you can you know

00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,710
tweet at me or something and say that

00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,750
works I can't believe it

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,700
so stick to the basics customize a bit

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:15,610
to the client's brand and needs

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,260
keep it short and sweet and don't keep a

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,830
hot lead waiting because you don't have

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,760
time to produce a 20 page proposal I

00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:26,230
promise you they're gonna appreciate

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:29,470
your your clarity and your speed okay

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,870
now the other thing I see as a mistake

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,770
for people building is they spend a lot

00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:38,800
of time on consulting and educating and

00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:40,860
that has value if you offer to sit in a

00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,020
half-a-day meeting with the client to

00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,450
discover their needs and to come up with

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:49,000
a requirements document for them that

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,680
has value and you're gonna be like oh I

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,800
don't know if I can charge for that time

00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,110
and I'm telling you they will pay for it

00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,420
if you position it the right way if you

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,430
say listen this is the goal of this time

00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,740
where I'm going to produce a document

00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,540
for you that you can then take and shop

00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,510
out to anybody that you want but you'll

00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,970
also find out how it is to work together

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:11,410
whoa you just relieved all pressure and

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,720
you might have gotten four or five

00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,550
hundred dollars for building that

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,140
initial requirements document with them

00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:20,350
and meeting their team and getting to

00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,960
know them versus wasting your whole day

00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,660
and wondering if they're ever gonna buy

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,060
project from you and I hope that changes

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:33,310
your lives a little bit because this is

00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:36,460
really this discovery scope could be the

00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:38,350
way of actually winning more clients in

00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,509
the long run they will appreciate that

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,009
you didn't pay them that you didn't

00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:43,719
ask them to pay for the full site before

00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,209
knowing how it is to work with you and

00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,829
before knowing what they needed and

00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:49,919
you'll you know improve your cash flow

00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:54,009
and your time management

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:56,459
keep your Tarin simple now some projects

00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:59,559
are small and some projects are large I

00:30:56,459 --> 00:31:01,389
really have a hard time doing projects

00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:06,639
without a deposit I would not do that

00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:08,349
and you know having milestones is great

00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,849
in a larger project and really being

00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:12,449
clear about this is when the payments

00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:15,639
happen now for some sites and for some

00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:18,669
businesses it doesn't even make sense to

00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:20,739
have milestone projects they don't

00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:24,219
understand what a milestone is they just

00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:26,859
don't get that and so sometimes I do it

00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:30,309
based on time and I'll say it's 50% now

00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:33,839
and 50% on this timeline in this date

00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:38,349
and that is because managing their

00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:42,039
response to you is on them to be

00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:44,589
responsive right and so it's a tricky

00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,719
subject but I have had a completion

00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:49,029
payment in two months before they

00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:51,969
actually finished approving our content

00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:53,619
and that is just how we set it up at the

00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:55,989
beginning of the project and it's fair

00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:59,769
because they're they know that they're

00:31:55,989 --> 00:32:02,319
not responsive right so that's that's

00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:05,169
just a suggestion but definitely make

00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,549
sure you've got a good deposit up front

00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:07,690
you don't want to be doing a lot of work

00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:12,309
without knowing that they're going to

00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:14,199
pay you if you were a theme oriented

00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:17,349
person like I am and I have a friend

00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:19,149
that is vehemently anti famine so you

00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:21,940
might be in that camp too but I love a

00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:23,259
good theme I do not like you know in the

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,059
past they used to spend you know a

00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:27,999
couple hours going out and searching for

00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:30,129
the best theme and what makes more sense

00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:32,229
for this business and I you know I could

00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:34,929
just really get wound up in this and now

00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:37,539
I use why not two three themes that

00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:41,589
we've used repeatedly and I just show

00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:43,959
different you know versions of them to

00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:46,509
see what the customer likes if they

00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:50,139
haven't already given me an inspiration

00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:51,960
site but I do really like for them to

00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:54,299
give me sites that they like

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,490
and features that they admire and and

00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,440
layouts that they think are really great

00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,299
so that I understand their taste their

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,119
aesthetic and that makes it a lot easier

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:04,379
to give them something they love make

00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,779
sure you get that design direction

00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,700
approved lay out one page for them say

00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:13,110
do you like it

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:16,919
versus like get it

00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,869
getting the whole site done in one

00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,399
design and then suddenly oh my gosh you

00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:23,700
know they hate it they need everything

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,519
shaded straight and how do you keep

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,379
communication flowing with a client make

00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,499
sure you have a weekly schedule where

00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:34,950
you say I'm gonna call you and/or update

00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:36,509
you on this schedule I'm you know I'm

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,519
committing to you I'm gonna use plain

00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:40,769
English as I describe things to you

00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,149
we're gonna have a big conversation it's

00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,830
not gonna be too techie because some

00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:48,450
clients are super afraid of the techie

00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:50,990
parts of this and they will really

00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:55,169
appreciate that and then three minutes

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,539
is that what it is okay or does that

00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:59,639
mean that's a three out of five from the

00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:04,129
Russian charger that always happening

00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:06,450
okay all right and help them understand

00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:09,450
what to look for in the stage you need

00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:11,159
so growing the business from freelancer

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,750
to agency like if you're one person

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,659
you're doing everything you're getting

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,730
burned out you can't go on vacation it's

00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,889
feast or famine if you can't sell fast

00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,020
enough and deliver fast enough as you

00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:25,020
start to grow you may be able to take on

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,450
more clients six to twelve clients and

00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,579
get a more consistent workflow going you

00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:32,429
start to specialize your resources and

00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:35,520
build teams around design developing

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,470
account management content creation it

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,990
gets to be a little bit easier but

00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:45,480
making that leap from one to two is

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:47,099
super hard and then to beyond now the

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,510
good thing is that you can find a lot of

00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,250
freelancers that are willing to work

00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,740
with you on a project basis and I

00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,990
recommend before you jump into like all

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,290
these full-time resources to have a more

00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:01,079
elastic staffing model and to find some

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,520
really trustworthy freelancers who want

00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,530
to get business from you on a regular

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,780
basis and

00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:09,540
tell people what to do what you do

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,540
always be sharing what you do and how

00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,370
you do it and your client projects not

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,590
just when it's slow because that's a

00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,450
tendency is like oh I don't have any

00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:21,120
projects next month I better start

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,400
telling people what I do but always

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,550
right always how that is a steady

00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,420
drumbeat of your business oh man I had

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:33,600
some more stuff here but some good I'm

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,100
gonna give you some last things we

00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,530
didn't get to steam work but you could

00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,780
ask me questions about that lining up

00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,360
clients here's one of my best strategies

00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,830
the Ugly Betty strategy now people used

00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,080
to come up to me in the street when the

00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:48,960
show first came out and say hey your

00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,610
Ugly Betty and I was like what I didn't

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,980
know what this was but anyway I'm gonna

00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:56,640
call this the Ugly Betty strategy it's

00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,930
time okay it's the last one look for if

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,750
you're on a trade show we've got an ugly

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:03,390
booth or find an ugly website find an

00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:07,530
ugly ad that's your client they need you

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:11,340
right okay

00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:14,400
oh I could put on my glasses and get

00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,270
braces okay so that's one of the best

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,280
strategies

00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:19,590
I guess we'll open it up for questions

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,470
and you can ask me like anything else

00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:26,700
that can go over other specialties here

00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:33,930
and tell you more about see mark whoops

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:37,410
at the end maybe yeah we can figure that

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:44,160
out I think they have it now you want to

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:47,870
ask a question sure yeah for sure we can

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,870
do that yes

00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:57,930
well you know if how long did it take me

00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:59,430
well as long as it took me to realize I

00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:03,480
didn't want to do everything by myself

00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,799
so I started to find a good crew of how

00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,069
they don't need to given time four or

00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:11,579
five freelancers that I could rely on to

00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:15,900
be consistent and delivering the product

00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:17,910
so I decided to do that early I've been

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,520
working with some of them like six or

00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,319
seven years at least and refer the month

00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,260
are their clients and everything too so

00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:28,230
that they got that steady work going to

00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,210
because as an owner of an agency you

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,520
really do feel responsible if you can't

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,589
supply them with enough work then you

00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,809
feel kind of guilty that you are not

00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:41,010
keeping them going but we have a lot of

00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:43,440
you know we have a lot of good people in

00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:47,280
our network now that we do some work to

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,369
pretty regularly so right now I'm not

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,470
actively running a hardcore big

00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,270
WordPress agency my business has shifted

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:59,750
a lot but we still do WordPress and

00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,750
support our existing clients okay

00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:08,140
yeah so the goal of that phase is the

00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,690
requirements document that just gives

00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,990
you a detailed scope of what is going to

00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:17,110
be in the docket in the project and then

00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:21,000
estimates associated with it so the so

00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:23,830
it's in a way it's helping them I have

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,370
decide what a project should cost and

00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:29,230
how to communicate a good formed project

00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,600
to anybody else so they could take that

00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,070
document and they could say okay great

00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,590
now that we flush this out

00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,300
give me three bids but most of the time

00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,770
they won't want to because they like

00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,540
working with you already does that make

00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:43,090
sense so on a bigger project I think

00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,260
it's a super valuable way if they're

00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,390
like well we're not ready we're not

00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,640
ready we don't know what we want to say

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,260
well great why don't we do five hundred

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,980
thousand two thousand whatever the

00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:56,380
number is it's relative to the what you

00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,850
think that long term size of the project

00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,890
would be because some projects could be

00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:04,270
twenty twenty-five it just depends on

00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:07,600
like how complex the business is do like

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:19,680
a 10% project up front to get to that

00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:19,680
scope does that make sense yeah yes

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,550
what

00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,980
that's an awesome question and to show

00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,230
insight in the questions up front with

00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,330
the client to talk about the segments

00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:46,530
that they serve is really important

00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:47,790
right so right so does a six year old

00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,940
woman who's been making wedding cakes

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:53,370
their whole life know what a you know 20

00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,590
to 30 year old bride once well probably

00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:58,500
because she talked to you know thousands

00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,760
of 30 year old Brides but does she know

00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,050
what that looks like from a web

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,520
perspective right so it's I have a

00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,860
phrase in my contract that I actually

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,070
borrowed from another friend of mine who

00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:13,800
runs WordPress shop too and it was we

00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:15,720
reserve the right in our professional

00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,330
opinion to push back on you when we

00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,850
believe that you're you know making the

00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:23,850
wrong decision like we want to have that

00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:25,710
healthy dialogue in order to get to the

00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:28,230
best outcome for you and to serve your

00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,960
clients does that make sense I really do

00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,580
have that built into my agreement

00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,800
because I want to set that expectation

00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,420
upfront that we know what we're doing we

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,260
know what you know you're doing you make

00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,710
amazing cakes

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,840
full-stop like we honor and cherish that

00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,640
right but we know what we're doing

00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,850
because we've built you know hundreds of

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,340
sites and we we know what the trends are

00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,990
we know what works we want to make sure

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,180
that we're doing the best job for you

00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,010
just like you know more about

00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,350
buttercream than I do and we know more

00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:00,720
about WordPress than you do right so I

00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:03,030
do build that engine it's an interesting

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,440
perspective and maybe not something

00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,330
everybody has been comfortable or

00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,570
thought about before but when I saw that

00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:11,670
clause I was like that is that is

00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:17,790
getting adopted for my use because it's

00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:18,690
awesome okay that's it and that's it

00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,190
okay

00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,190
Russian chives said it's time

00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,790
listen maybe the we were just talking

00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,390
but thank you for your attention and

00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,390
