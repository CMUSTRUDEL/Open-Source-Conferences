Description: 
	April 5, 2019, 9 am, University Center, College of the Canyons — With the new Gutenberg editor, WordPress has created a new format with blocks that do a lot of what page builders have traditionally offered. So why would anyone still want to use a page builder? Jason will talk about:
– The biggest difference between Elementor and Gutenberg and why I use Elementor for the foreseeable future;
– The advantages and disadvantages of using my favorite page builder – Elementor (free version). Other page builders are similar;
– How Elementor works with themes and which one should be used;
– Using free plugins to extend Elementor;
– A quick overview of how to use Elementor; and
– Build a quick example of a home page
