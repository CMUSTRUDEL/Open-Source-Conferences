Title: Jason Orellana: Page Builder Magic
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	April 5, 2019, 9 am, University Center, College of the Canyons — With the new Gutenberg editor, WordPress has created a new format with blocks that do a lot of what page builders have traditionally offered. So why would anyone still want to use a page builder? Jason will talk about:
– The biggest difference between Elementor and Gutenberg and why I use Elementor for the foreseeable future;
– The advantages and disadvantages of using my favorite page builder – Elementor (free version). Other page builders are similar;
– How Elementor works with themes and which one should be used;
– Using free plugins to extend Elementor;
– A quick overview of how to use Elementor; and
– Build a quick example of a home page

please welcome Jason oriano Pedro

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,180
dramatic

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:21,930
my name is Jason Orianna I'm a again I'm

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,950
a wordpress developer working in my own

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,990
agency with my lovely wife Josie I'm

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,529
here to talk to you today about using

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:39,110
page builders to make beautiful websites

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:41,010
oh let's see especially my favorite one

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,860
Elementor that's the one that I'm gonna

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,199
be demonstrating and I'm gonna give you

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,440
some of the pros and cons of using page

00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:51,809
builders and despite some of these cons

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,089
why I think page builders are still

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,309
magic okay so let me I know if they

00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:02,010
already introduced me but again I

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,240
graduated from ITT I've been doing

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,540
WordPress since since 2016 and I started

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,119
my business in 2017 that's it in a

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:17,909
nutshell so what is the page builder a

00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:21,030
page builder is a is a tool that

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,710
facilitates web development by allowing

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:30,659
you to grab blocks or elements such as

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:32,850
images headings paragraphs lists and

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,579
what have you and lets you grab these

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,149
blocks and put them more or less

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,719
wherever you want on a page to form a

00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:45,030
final website without having to write

00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,649
any code and that's that's what I think

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,299
the main advantage is you don't have to

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:55,770
write any code so why use a page builder

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,259
because it is easy to use because it's

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:02,280
easy to use and also it's highly

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,369
customizable you're able to create

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,100
unique designs without having to code

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,430
and it's very efficient you don't have

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,910
to keep going back and forth between

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,790
tabs you don't have to refresh browsers

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,820
you don't have to write write code in a

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,820
separate file it's very efficient

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:33,900
so so in order to show you a little bit

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:38,010
oh okay um so the new WordPress editor

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:41,579
right Gutenberg it's it's considered a

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:45,030
block a block editor so it's it shares a

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:47,159
lot of similarities with with page

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,879
builders but there's there's a lot of

00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:56,000
differences right um let me show you I

00:02:50,879 --> 00:03:00,780
actually stole some blocks for my kids

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,760
to show you an example all right so so

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,480
if you were to build a website right now

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,819
you would typically start with or you

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,329
might start with a banner or hero

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:15,810
section and that would usually have

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:19,650
maybe so a picture and then some text

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:24,150
and then under that you might have maybe

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:26,730
a couple of paragraphs maybe or a

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,040
headline and a paragraph and depending

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:35,329
on the depending on your theme or your

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:39,060
preferences you might have a sidebar the

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:42,780
it both the Gutenberg editor and the

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,180
page builders allow you to easily add

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:50,669
like let's say if you wanted to add a

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,109
two column row for example let's say you

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,000
had an image and some text that you

00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:57,509
wanted to put in that'd be very easy to

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,870
do with a page builder and and with

00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:04,829
Gutenberg and it's also very easy to

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,720
rearrange the order of things so if you

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,000
if you wanted to drop one of the

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,549
paragraphs down it it's it's very easy

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,689
to to just move them around right you

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:18,570
just move the blocks around and if if

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:20,549
you prefer you could even move the

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,349
sidebar to the other side that wouldn't

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:33,120
be too hard oh boy I think I got the

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:35,219
wrong file so so that's that's kind of

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,509
where where a lot of similarities in if

00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:38,669
you

00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,490
if you were to look at the Gutenberg

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,499
editor on the back end to build that

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,889
example the website that I just had the

00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:50,129
blocks you might have your you might

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,300
have your the title and the featured

00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:53,460
image right here on the right hand side

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,879
and both of those together would make

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,039
the banner and you can see the other

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,800
elements the paragraph the two column

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:06,689
row that's my daughter by the way and

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,990
then another row on the bottom so one of

00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:11,879
the things you can see right here is the

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,629
header you can't see the header you

00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:19,620
can't see the the sidebar and you can't

00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:21,150
see some of the styling right so this is

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,400
what it might look like on the front end

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,680
it looks very very different than what

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:30,810
it looks like on the back end if you

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:37,860
were to to build this if you were to use

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:39,029
a page builder instead you you I if I

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,349
was to scroll down a little bit you

00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:43,409
would actually be able to see the header

00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:48,479
you can see your your blocks that you're

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:49,860
working with anytime you want to adjust

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,430
something you just adjust it on the

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,449
right hand side this is an example of

00:05:52,430 --> 00:06:02,129
Elementor which is the one that I'm

00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:05,580
using and if you were to actually go

00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:09,089
right here if you wanted to to say for

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,180
example increase the spacing between the

00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:14,189
blocks or if you wanted to if you wanted

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,990
to stagger the the blocks or if you

00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:21,300
wanted to make one of the blocks around

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:24,149
it how would you accomplish is right

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,649
here right um sometimes you have a few

00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:29,819
options right here it's it's a little

00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:33,810
bit limited but sometimes you have

00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,129
options here and you can actually if you

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,169
if you know how to code you can actually

00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,810
go into the you can go into the

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,610
customizer and then edit the CSS

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,930
yourself and make some of these changes

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:50,039
yourself but if you're a beginner and

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,610
you don't know how to code or if

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:57,330
if you if you're worried about like

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,860
having a typo in your code or or if

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,419
you're if you're worried about like

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,849
forgetting a semicolon or something like

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:08,189
that you know that that happens all the

00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:11,369
time you you might be better off using a

00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:14,789
page builder and this this is what it

00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:18,360
might look like like say if you wanted

00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:21,330
to to to make giving effect to the the

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,389
banner it's very easy to just click on

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,629
the banner and do some effects right

00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,879
there on the left hand side if you want

00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:34,319
you can very easily add spacing between

00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:38,360
the columns without writing any code you

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:43,770
can make a picture round you can stagger

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:48,779
the the columns make them overlap you

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:51,119
can add styling when I first started you

00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:56,039
or actually before I started using

00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:57,419
WordPress I actually heard I almost

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,059
didn't want to use WordPress because a

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,699
lot of the sites that I saw that were

00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:05,580
built using WordPress they looked a very

00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,919
cookiecutter to me and that's not what I

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,349
wanted I wanted to build unique websites

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,839
sites that would impress people right

00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:15,269
and I think this is a tool that really

00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:18,899
facilitates that it makes it makes it

00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:22,379
easy to create like a round picture you

00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,969
know that a round block makes it's not

00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,769
it's not a big deal it's not hard to

00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:32,060
code but if you can do it easier I mean

00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:38,849
that's that's it's its efficiency right

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:43,319
okay so I'm gonna go into some examples

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,730
of how to how to use a page builder in a

00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,290
little bit but first I want to go

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,889
through some of the pros and cons of

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:54,029
using it starting with the biggest pros

00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:57,180
and cons right all right so the right

00:08:54,029 --> 00:09:00,510
design can can really help you

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,699
accomplish your goal right you can lead

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,050
customers to work to where you want them

00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,810
to

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:08,060
can engage your customers with a good

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,130
design and page builders can help you do

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,529
that right and if you have customers

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:17,839
that are engaged that stay on your page

00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:21,200
longer then then you can it can

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,750
positively affect your SEO right on the

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,370
other hand the main negative part about

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,920
using page builders is that they add

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,110
weight to your page it's a bigger file

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,690
that has to be downloaded which is not

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,880
if you're on a desktop and you have a

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,010
good connection it's not a problem right

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,839
usually but if you're on a mobile phone

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,640
or you have a bad connection it you can

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:50,930
have a higher bounce rate and that can

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:54,110
affect SEO right okay so the theme

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,779
integration according to the page

00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:01,010
builders um they claim that they work

00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:04,190
with any theme but in in reality that

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,079
sometimes sometimes there's PHP errors

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,279
sometimes you have layout issues where

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,350
the margins are off and sometimes you

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:17,750
have loading issues sometimes the pages

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:20,630
don't load correctly and if you if you

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,490
go to google and you and you do a you

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,950
ask google like what what works best

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,130
what themes work best with page builders

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:32,300
you can get many good answers I use

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,600
Astra myself but I've also used ocean WP

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:39,070
and generate press and those are good

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:45,500
good themes to use with page builders

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:46,640
let's see customer handoff sometimes you

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,130
have you might have a customer that

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:54,290
wants to be able to edit their own work

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:56,810
and the advantage to a page builder

00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:00,350
sometimes is that they're easy to use so

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:03,470
if your customer wanted to learn how to

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,420
how to use a page builder and wanted to

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,800
edit themselves it would be very easy to

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,390
do there's a lot of YouTube videos

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,540
online that you can that you can find

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:17,870
it'll help you - it'll help your

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,910
customer but on the other side if you're

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,720
handing off to your customer they they

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:26,810
might like they might end up using Comic

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,329
Sans fonts you know and and you might uh

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:33,920
you might have all the spacing thrown

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:35,240
offs so a few months down the road after

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,490
you hand it off you might not even

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,290
recognize that as you own work if you

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,320
hand it off so I really would recommend

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,820
if you're if you're handing off to the

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,019
customer that wants to edit their own

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:50,990
work that that you use the good Sandburg

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:52,970
editor instead and try to try to not

00:11:50,990 --> 00:12:02,149
have too many options for customers

00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:06,680
right design paid filters can help you

00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:08,540
design in the browser so so because you

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,180
can see your changes live and because

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,550
you can you can manipulate it and you

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,079
can position things wherever you want

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,000
you can you can design in the browser

00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,790
instead of having to sometimes use like

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,360
Photoshop or other other tools that that

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:27,890
that might um they might help you with

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,779
design you can you can see your changes

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,480
live you can see what they would look

00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,640
like on desktop tablet and mobile views

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,570
with a push of a button it's very easy

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,970
so you don't always need a designer you

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,100
can download templates if you wanna if

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:46,130
you want a quick start you can always

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,440
download the template online and just

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,540
change the the image and the words it's

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,670
it's very easy to do or if you've

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,320
already created a web page that you like

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:58,250
on another site you can actually

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:03,250
download the template and use it on that

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:05,570
type or on other sites as well but

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,579
designers you know they're there for

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,990
reason they they can make your product

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:13,160
better they can help you with product

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,060
engagement so it's actually good to have

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,959
someone who knows what they're doing

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,959
sometimes yeah

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,449
and same thing with development you

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,089
don't need to know how to code to to to

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,070
use a page builder

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:28,930
that's that's one of the main advantages

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,940
of it you don't have to code CSS you

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,640
don't you don't have the errors like

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,570
like I said if you forget semicolons or

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,620
something that's also a disadvantage

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,180
yeah that you don't need to know how to

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,800
code if you're gonna be building

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,690
websites for a living

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,779
you should eventually note learn how to

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:50,310
code and you're a friendly neighborhood

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:57,580
web developer needs to eat so don't

00:13:50,310 --> 00:14:01,140
don't cut them out mice the time is not

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,010
right in the slides but you get it

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,450
competition there's there's a lot of

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,570
competition between the page builders

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:10,800
this Elementor divi divi beaver builder

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:14,110
visual composer i'm using element tour

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,610
but these are other great options and

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,390
and there's more I think there was a

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:21,010
thrive or something and they're

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,460
constantly competing with each other and

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,080
because they want you to use them so

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,100
they give you a lot of a lot of features

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:33,130
they give you a lot of they add

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,390
constantly keep adding features but

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,490
which can be a disadvantage because

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,250
there's there's almost daily updates

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,370
sometimes and and sometimes when you hit

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:45,430
when the customers have too many options

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,860
or when when the designer or a developer

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:50,800
has too many options sometimes they tend

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:56,640
to use it or overuse it and you want to

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,640
keep things simple sometimes all right

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:09,190
my next slide okay so when you're using

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,600
page builders you can have you can make

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,500
beautiful designs right and you can

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,720
impress it's a it's a good umm among

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,730
your peers other designers developers

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,260
you can impress them buy it buy your

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,550
product right the way it looks it's a

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:28,660
beautiful page but like for example I

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,550
was at a meet-up recently and and one

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,310
one one developer said to another

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,500
developer that he used a page builder to

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,010
make a website and the other developer

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,020
said that he

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:47,620
that if you use a page builder you are

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:49,480
not a real developer all right so yeah I

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,680
mean you're you're really not going to

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,880
satisfy everybody and if you're you if

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,740
you have a tool that's gonna make you

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,410
more efficient you shouldn't be worried

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:06,160
too much about about what other people

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:09,250
are saying all right so so using a page

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,030
builder is a it's kind of a balancing

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,280
act right you you want to whether you

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:19,510
should or not is a balancing act on the

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,150
one hand you want a good design on the

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:26,650
one hand you want to get design and you

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:29,530
want to be able to add flair right you

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,150
want to be able to add flair and you can

00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:35,440
you can sometimes add too much Flair

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:37,960
right and and it comes off as tacky so

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,250
it's easy to use it's highly

00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
customizable so you can do a lot of

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,630
things but you want to keep the Flair

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,840
under control on the other hand there's

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,660
performance right I hope there's no San

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,000
Antonio Spurs fans in here but I find

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,490
the San Antonio Spurs the most boring

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,980
team right there they're they're

00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,560
extremely boring but they're effective

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,560
they they they constantly win

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:12,730
easy-to-use performance err they're

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,800
effective they're in 1998 the highest

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,709
the highest rated and being finals was a

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,280
Chicago Bulls versus a Utah Utah Jazz

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:23,140
right

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:26,320
they had 29 million viewers the the San

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,480
Antonio Spurs in 2007 they played the

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,750
Cleveland Cavaliers and they had nine

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,000
million viewers that's a twenty million

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,340
viewer difference right so even though

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,650
they're winning there they're a good

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:44,290
team you know they might not be the best

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:47,110
as far as if you're running a business

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,140
right if you're running a business you

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,700
want to make money and that's that would

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,900
be the ultimate goal and you're not

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:59,290
with this even though you're winning

00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:02,400
right so so it's kind of there's there's

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:09,580
a balance between having flair and and

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:13,180
and having speed so um I'm gonna show

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,250
you so you guys had it some basics on

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,430
how to use a page filter in case you're

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:23,650
do you're new to this but um here's some

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:26,110
here's some links that I had I'm gonna

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,780
share the some of these links and I'm

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,200
actually missing a link here but uh this

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,720
one this one in particular talks about a

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,960
page speed and and they recommend you

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,930
not use page builders because because of

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,230
speed but um there's there are certain

00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:47,080
things you can do and I still recommend

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,670
it because it's an efficiency tool right

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,830
I'm gonna save the questions for later I

00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:56,170
actually I actually uploaded the wrong

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,360
slide so I don't have all my sites here

00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:05,460
but let me go into an example of how to

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:05,460
use a page builder elements or okay

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,470
whoa

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,660
I'm sorry I had this ready I don't know

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,880
why this can I do all right

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:29,620
I saw a view here's your workplace

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:29,620
dashboard if you want it - oh okay

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:50,210
Mir duplicate okay all right so here's

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:54,350
your WordPress dashboard if you if you

00:19:50,210 --> 00:20:04,670
wanted to download web the page builder

00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:09,250
you could go to our plugins let me put

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,250
this out page

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:27,650
you guys can hear me write that page

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:32,680
builders so um okay add new hoof sorry

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,680
you can go to page builder

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,509
all right so the first one that comes up

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:46,190
is Elementor I've already installed it

00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,359
but if you had an install that you would

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,269
just install right here

00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:58,609
you install and then activate so I'm

00:20:50,269 --> 00:21:02,330
gonna activate it right now yeah

00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:04,039
Elementor is free to use yes so so most

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:07,609
of these most of these are free to use

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:09,919
they do have pro options but you can

00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:14,090
start with the free and and that's

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,609
that's an excellent choice it's you know

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,099
you can't go wrong with using free and

00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:23,929
there's there's there's actually a lot

00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:26,419
of supplemental plugins that that can

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:29,899
actually help you do a lot of things

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:32,989
that that that some of the pro version

00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:34,639
is do so you don't actually for the most

00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:38,859
part you don't need to use the pro

00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:41,239
versions if you if you use other plugins

00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:47,749
so once it's installed you can actually

00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:52,609
oh I forgot what I wanted to do was

00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:58,369
actually duplicate another site more

00:21:52,609 --> 00:22:01,720
full and I had this up but I don't know

00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:01,720
why disappeared on me

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,989
oops

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,020
what what I wanted to do is there's

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,000
actually duplicate a site because you

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:32,080
want to see you want to see what it

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:37,030
could do and and we want to just make

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:41,230
make something that looks good right so

00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:43,740
I will go to new page I'm gonna try to

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,970
build this as fast as possible

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,330
there are a few other plugins that I

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:56,560
that I can use to hopefully extend

00:22:49,330 --> 00:23:01,030
Elementor so you can start with a title

00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,560
I'll call this example I think I already

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:08,520
have other examples here so I'll go with

00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,520
example four and just hit publish

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:16,690
publish and then you it has an option

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:22,120
right there to edit with Elementor right

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:23,800
up here and then it'll take you to

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,080
another screen where you can actually

00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,080
see the editor

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:54,029
so you can you can see that the header

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,769
and you can see the footer right here so

00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:58,860
you can actually see what it'll look

00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:00,720
like in the in the end you don't have to

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:05,159
guess what what the whole thing will

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,620
look like together if you wanted to add

00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,649
a section you could just add this click

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:14,220
this plus symbol right here we'll start

00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:16,139
with a one column these are all these

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,389
are different column sizes right so you

00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:22,320
could go with 1 column 2 column 3 column

00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:29,360
and so on and so forth I'm gonna use a 1

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:33,600
column right now and up here where these

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:38,820
squares are that's where you can add

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:41,190
like say for example a heading if we go

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,679
back to here you can see this has a this

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:56,090
has text and a heading and then more

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:56,090
text so we're gonna do text heading

00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,390
more text

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:21,400
Bruce Banner let's see

00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:23,620
you can edit either right there in the

00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,280
in the editor or you can edit right here

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:31,060
on the left hand side whichever is

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:35,460
easier for you sometimes whatever your

00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,460
preferences are oops

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,799
I'm gonna copy this text

00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:01,490
and while it's doing that I'm gonna so

00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:06,320
when you want to style it you can just

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:10,550
go right here actually since this is the

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:13,760
title I would usually put our h1 right

00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:15,620
here and you could style it right here

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,280
you can make it uh you can change the

00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,280
color real easily

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:22,490
I'm gonna make this why because there's

00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:30,800
a background picture then I'm going to

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:40,340
add right now and typography I'm gonna

00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:47,540
change the size make it a big and I

00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:49,730
already uploaded some pictures so this

00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,670
this section right up here controls the

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:55,910
whole roll right there's if you wanted

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:58,270
to control the column this is a column

00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,270
right there

00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:03,860
to edit the column if you wanted to

00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,480
control the section you can click on the

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,870
section itself the the little um

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,290
whatever your your block is right there

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:16,090
but right here I want to add I want to

00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:21,640
add an image to the background of the

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:28,910
the whole row so I could go to style

00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:32,110
background type image oh boy

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,110
media library

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:44,190
oh shoot I'm actually using the wrong

00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:53,970
let me I'm sorry guys let me

00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:05,879
let me do this real fast I'm sorry guys

00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:16,700
the when when the internet went down

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,700
somehow he closed my page and

00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:43,510
so already I think I already got this

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:47,560
down real fast in a suit so we've got a

00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:51,070
plugins activate I had also downloaded a

00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,810
few other plugins essential add-ons for

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,110
Elementor I'm gonna activate that one

00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:57,670
while I'm here that's that has many

00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:03,340
features that can extend the

00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:16,990
functionality and kick me up let me

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:26,530
create a new page sorry guys yeah sample

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:27,730
for publish publish within a mentor so

00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:34,000
I'll go through some of these stuff that

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:34,840
I just did real fast yeah there you go

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,370
that's a better

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,620
that's a better example because it has a

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,200
the header and the footer that the

00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,960
header that I already styled I started

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,090
the header using ah the the theme and I

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:58,090
got it as close as I could to the Hulk

00:29:46,090 --> 00:30:01,200
example okay so section I'm gonna put

00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,200
this image in right away

00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:11,940
so right there you could just choose

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:15,090
your image insert media you have the

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,250
position you have all kinds of options

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:22,070
are here on how you want to eat how you

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,070
want it to look I want it in the center

00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:29,760
you can kind of do a parallax effect if

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,559
you push fixed I don't want that right

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,730
now because they don't have that but um

00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:41,250
it's a nice feature repeat and I'll

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:45,840
repeat size cover and I'm gonna I'm

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:48,690
gonna add a minimum height to this I

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,450
don't know why by default it usually has

00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:55,590
gaps and and I usually like to take off

00:30:51,450 --> 00:31:12,289
the gaps mmm the t minimum height I'm

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:12,289
gonna do 45 pH a title

00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:56,110
so to style it let's see we're gonna

00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:01,830
make this white it's very easy to change

00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:05,320
the font size go to typography let's go

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:08,110
1.3 and one of the one of the nice

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,870
things you can do when you when you have

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:14,650
you've already styled you've already

00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:17,560
styled one one div you can actually copy

00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:20,710
it right-click it and copy and then you

00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,470
can go on the next one and just pay

00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:27,790
style and then you can see it's already

00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:33,550
styled I'll make sure you commit that's

00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:35,290
some oh yeah yeah let's see I copied it

00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,670
right now right click do this one right

00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:40,510
here because I already made though text

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:43,960
white I copied it and then I highlighted

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:47,440
the other paragraph and right clicked it

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,590
and where it says paste style I just

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,680
pasted the style and it's so it's very

00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,790
easy to to be consistent with all your

00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,460
like say if you had a bunch of

00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,870
paragraphs you can you can very easily

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,320
apply the same style to all your

00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,320
paragraphs

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:10,120
let's see style text color white I'm

00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,090
gonna add some margin to this on the

00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,300
bottom so this right here unlink sit so

00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:20,830
you could have different margins for

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:27,000
different different sides top right

00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:27,000
bottom 30

00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:37,570
all right and if you notice this one

00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,580
right here the this text right here only

00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,080
goes like halfway through the screen it

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:46,529
doesn't go to it doesn't go the whole

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,529
length so I can easily change that oops

00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:03,149
I can easily change this click right

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:06,240
here custom positioning I could change

00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:08,510
the width and custom width and I can

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:19,440
actually choose percentage and put like

00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:22,589
50% so now the not only goes to 50% did

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,389
you have a question okay sorry alright

00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:26,820
I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and add

00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:34,730
another row this someone I'm gonna add a

00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:44,250
two column row and right here I'm gonna

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:46,379
search for a navigation menu and I'm

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,919
gonna insert that and right here you can

00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:53,040
I already set up this menu in in the

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,540
customizer for in the theme so you can

00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,180
actually just from the drop-down choose

00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:01,950
your menu and like I said previously

00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,240
sometimes you do know you need to know

00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:06,270
how to code it a little bit just because

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:12,180
there are certain limitations to to even

00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:13,290
page builders so I had already uh added

00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:17,820
some code in here

00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:19,440
so if you already have if you if you

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,900
want to add custom codes you can still

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,420
put it in the customizer and then just

00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:32,730
add add your classes here I'm gonna add

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:42,270
a class character and you can see it's

00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:47,660
already styled in this example this this

00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:51,270
is kind of up here over over the banner

00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:55,670
so I'm going to give this negative

00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:55,670
margin to move it up

00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,840
oops

00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,660
negative

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,410
seventy and right here I'm gonna head

00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:17,310
see there's there's a lot of a lot of

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:19,830
tools that you can use so I could just

00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:24,200
type in social and you can see I have a

00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,200
social icons that are already pre-made

00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:35,760
the I did I did read somewhere that that

00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,280
one of the problems with people there

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,980
sometimes is that they they download

00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,310
other stuff so sometimes when they

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,830
download the likes a font awesome and

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:51,480
other stuff they it adds a lot of extra

00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:52,770
weight to the page builders so I don't

00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,400
know if there's a way around it if you

00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:59,700
if you if you definitely need the icons

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,070
put them it saves it saves time to use

00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:06,920
this tools

00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:09,240
let's see you don't want that one and I

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:15,440
don't want the official color I want

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:19,950
custom color and make this white and

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,570
this one light gray by by the way here's

00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,500
another neat thing right here in the

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:28,970
hamburger menu up there on the top right

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:31,619
you can actually choose the color picker

00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:39,859
you can choose colors I say if I wanted

00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:48,410
a red I could go with whoops I could uh

00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:51,390
FF RGB 0 0 0 0 right and I could apply

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:54,840
and now every time every time I want to

00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:57,060
change colors I can its it appears right

00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,770
there in my menu so this is gonna be for

00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,890
my whole screen so I could I could save

00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:03,660
my colors that for the whole for the

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:08,660
whole webpage I'm not going to use red

00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:11,160
but I'm gonna use I see one of these and

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,859
it works great for positioning I could

00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,480
position it to the right and I'm gonna

00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:17,840
give this one our negative margin as

00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,840
well

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:31,030
negative 50 negative 40 one thing I did

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:41,880
forget to add on the banner if you see

00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:41,880
oops okay come on go away

00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,240
that

00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:53,220
well I don't know if you can see it but

00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,470
but uh yeah this is tilted right here

00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:59,880
this is right here this is lower than up

00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:03,170
here that might that might be a little

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,610
bit hard to do if I actually did it on

00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:10,620
just using the Gutenberg editor and I

00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:13,020
had to use clip clip path but when you

00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:16,380
do it right here on element tour it

00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:20,910
actually inserts a I believe it's s SVG

00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:24,030
file which is SVG I think is pretty

00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:28,050
performed it let's see so I can go right

00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:31,740
here and I could choose style and a

00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:34,710
shape divider and I could put it out

00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:38,400
either on the top or the bottom and

00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:41,360
right here I'm going to choose tilts you

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:47,100
can see it has a big tilt right there

00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:52,370
I'm gonna flip it and then I could make

00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,370
this not so high maybe 40

00:39:54,719 --> 00:40:00,609
and you know what I'm going to do I'm

00:39:57,249 --> 00:40:03,809
going to increase I'm going to increase

00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,809
the padding on this

00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:21,290
update and see this button right here

00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,430
you can actually although you can see

00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,380
you can see what it looks like right

00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,790
here it doesn't take up the full width

00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,110
so you can either if you wanted to see

00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:33,530
what it looks like you can either click

00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:36,860
here or you can you can actually load it

00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:39,230
on on its own right there to see the

00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,090
example and and the advantage of this is

00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,200
that every time you hit update right

00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:48,640
here this one automatically reloads so

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,640
it's looking it's looking pretty close

00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:54,800
so what I did is I added padding so that

00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,590
uh so I can increase the space right

00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:02,420
here and I increased this piece right

00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:12,560
here so just to so it looked a little

00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:15,170
bit better I on the text blocks no but

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,140
but um the paragraph blocks already come

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:22,430
with padding on the bottom by I think

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,110
that's part of the theme actually so

00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:28,370
yeah they yeah they already come with

00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:31,700
padding on the bottom so let's um right

00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:34,730
now I'm gonna build uh I'm not gonna put

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:38,630
in add I'm gonna put in this section

00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:42,850
right here so so now we can add a two

00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:49,600
column row another two column row and

00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:54,440
I'm gonna add an image it's right there

00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:57,470
and again for some reason uh these these

00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:02,600
are sections the rows come with a extra

00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:06,170
gap and I don't like those gaps I'm

00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:08,270
using the Astra theme Astro Astro claims

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:10,670
to be a very lightweight I think I said

00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,680
something like 50 kilobytes or now it's

00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:16,240
that's pretty lightweight and I think

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:21,290
it's used often with with elements or

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,640
let's see so

00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:30,630
you can choose your image right here on

00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:42,690
the left hand side and let's see

00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:44,819
Oh Chris banner an add a heading and so

00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,480
we want to send it Center in vertically

00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:50,130
right so I would go to the column and

00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:57,690
then right here a vertical line I can

00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:59,819
choose middle choose middle and all

00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:06,690
right let's see I could actually copy

00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:13,170
copy this style copy paste style oops

00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:14,059
but this is black text let's go with

00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:17,660
that one

00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:17,660
and it's a

00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:36,410
I'm gonna leave this just for times sake

00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:38,390
I'm just gonna leave that there and now

00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:45,950
now this this this section is kind of

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:52,330
tricky the post when I arrived already

00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:52,330
created posts in the using the editor

00:43:53,770 --> 00:44:02,420
but if you wanted to import those posts

00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:06,800
you can you can add recent posts which

00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:09,500
is this is this what it what Elementor

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,060
comes by comes with by default but it

00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,160
doesn't have pictures or anything no

00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:19,420
images so I really don't want that I

00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,420
actually had to download a different eye

00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:29,060
down load a different plug-in called

00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:36,100
essential add-ons for Elementor and that

00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:36,100
one comes with post grade

00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:46,829
so you can see the the posts are already

00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:47,910
there and I want to I want to get

00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:56,729
through this real fast cuz I wanna I

00:44:47,910 --> 00:45:00,950
want to do that speed test and this

00:44:56,729 --> 00:45:00,950
comes with its own options let's see

00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:17,930
color background Porter background shoot

00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:25,289
where did you go

00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:26,039
background typography okay that was in

00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,979
the wrong section

00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:31,140
oh I don't want I don't want my picture

00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:33,299
there so you can it's very easy to

00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:38,569
customize it yeah I don't want the

00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:38,569
excerpt then I don't want meta

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:49,119
and I'm gonna make this white

00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,710
title post great style post background

00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,660
color yeah I'm gonna make that dark

00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:08,500
match all right so now it kind of

00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:12,070
matches it closely matches this website

00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,500
right except for that and you could see

00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:19,330
this part right here this is this is

00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:22,960
eros I could add a title here as well

00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:29,910
but um what I'm what I kind of wanted to

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,910
show Jason

00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:40,150
so I built this I had already built the

00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:42,270
same website

00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:45,520
I built it using just a Gutenberg editor

00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:49,720
and I had to I had to install the

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,760
Guttenberg block plug-in to to make the

00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:56,050
bottom part right here so it looks

00:46:51,760 --> 00:47:02,040
pretty similar as well what I wanted to

00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:02,040
do was go to pin dome

00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:12,870
and do a performance test on this

00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:19,930
so this is the one that I just built

00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:22,120
right and it is missing the the headline

00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:26,920
right here the latest news I already

00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:32,130
actually built some example to write

00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:42,360
here so let's just looks the same right

00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:50,970
so what I want to do is shoot plays

00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:50,970
website performance speed test

00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,880
five minutes okay

00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,480
GT metrics

00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,620
let's set out

00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,300
so

00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,780
and

00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:54,380
so this one this one is just using

00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:54,380
Gutenberg and this one is just using

00:48:54,469 --> 00:49:01,519
this one is using the elements or plugin

00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:03,330
oh shoot

00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,429
well

00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,429
[Music]

00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:18,690
it I'm not sure we're gonna have time

00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,869
but but uh anyway I did the speed test

00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:27,960
right already on on Pingdom and on

00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:31,260
Google insights so you can see the this

00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:38,430
is using just a Gutenberg it gets a c7

00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:43,800
t1 and this is the one using uh the page

00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:46,490
builder so it gets in a and addy I'm not

00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,490
sure how that works

00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,910
peach yeah

00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:06,230
yeah yeah so

00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:30,600
yeah Greg's a smart guy so yeah I think

00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:43,290
he more the the load the page the loaded

00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:50,040
page name probably and I don't know why

00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:52,950
it's smaller this one pretty much there

00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:56,430
what I got in the past results was was

00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:58,580
using just Gutenberg is is better it's

00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:01,950
faster but it takes a lot longer to code

00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:03,930
but it's very we're talking about like a

00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:07,920
half a second right half a second

00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:11,220
usually using page builder is is a

00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,160
bigger file and it's about half a second

00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,690
slower if you optimize it if you use a

00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,540
plug-in I was gonna show you but I ran

00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:21,120
that time if you if you if you install

00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,670
the Optima optimization plug-in you can

00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:27,180
actually make make that better and make

00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:32,130
it almost equal to the Gutenberg or

00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:33,150
sometimes even better but uh so it's

00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:37,860
something you have to consider right

00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:39,960
performance and value value pretty much

00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:43,770
efficiency how much time you're gonna

00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:47,220
spend on it I I did I this in about 15

00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:48,510
minutes you know so so it took me a lot

00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,600
longer to build other one using

00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:53,550
Gutenberg just a good Sandburg editor

00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,260
but if you're if you were building a web

00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:58,170
site where you were selling things you

00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:00,900
might want to consider speed a lot

00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:04,170
because you know you might have bounce

00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,970
rates people get getting tired of your

00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,650
page loading you know but if you're not

00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:09,990
selling products maybe maybe it's not

00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:13,200
maybe it doesn't matter as much and I

00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:16,260
actually did a I did I did a speed test

00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:21,619
on the on this page right here and this

00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:25,409
one it got a really low low paid speed

00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:28,199
speedtest of course they're running ads

00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:30,299
as well so that might affect it but but

00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:33,119
uh you know you got you got lower lower

00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:38,759
than both of my examples so that that's

00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:40,859
just FYI your questions well I hadn't

00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:44,459
used G metrics before but but I used a

00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:50,159
kingdom and I used a people

00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:55,169
oh the auto optimization yeah let's see

00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:59,489
I used and then in my slides I'm gonna

00:52:55,169 --> 00:53:02,339
have one more recommendation but but

00:52:59,489 --> 00:53:09,799
yeah there's actually some auto

00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:09,799
optimizes what is what I used yeah yes

00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:26,999
what code what do I use it each HTML is

00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:29,729
is is for any anybody on the web right

00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:34,109
the HTML is just the pretty much just

00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:36,630
the info CSS is the style and JavaScript

00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:38,909
is functionality so it's it's kind of a

00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,769
combination but you obviously you have

00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:46,229
to start with HTML because that's the

00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:49,519
foundation CSS is a style the CSS is

00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:53,059
what makes it looks good look good and

00:53:49,519 --> 00:54:02,989
yeah JavaScript not as much but but uh

00:53:53,059 --> 00:54:02,989
yes oh yes for WordPress PHP yes

00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:16,990
basic stuff but I would recommend you

00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:21,280
start with HTML PHP and PHP generates

00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:23,980
HTML that's its job so HTML they can't

00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:28,200
get your feet wet PHP to kind of take

00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:28,200
the next steps JavaScript

00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:45,820
I think I had a question back there yes

00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,030
and it's very simple to do that you just

00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:56,610
go right here to the bottom and save as

00:54:49,030 --> 00:55:03,910
template and give it a name my template

00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:06,250
save and I was actually gonna if I had

00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:08,770
time I was gonna fix the header because

00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:11,710
the header II I wanted to make it look

00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:15,910
closer to this example but that's that's

00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:19,780
something you can do X export a template

00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:22,600
and use it on other websites other

00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:25,450
websites or on the rest of the pages but

00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:28,050
yeah that's just hit save and then you

00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:41,890
could you could download right here

00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:45,190
export WordPress is its own program I

00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:48,130
think what it's built on PHP and you can

00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:52,870
use PHP on other another platforms

00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:55,470
there's competitors to WordPress but

00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,470
that

00:56:09,089 --> 00:56:24,759
yeah oh yes I completely forgot to

00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:27,880
mention that I'm sorry it's very easy to

00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:31,619
do and it you just go right here to this

00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:37,420
button down here and you can see tablet

00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:38,470
or mobile and yeah you could you can see

00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:42,900
there's a lot of things I need to change

00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:42,900
like I can make this I can make this

00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:49,420
like the full width instead it and and

00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:52,200
then then when you go back here it's

00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,970
still half you can make customizations

00:56:52,200 --> 00:57:15,730
strictly for the mobile that's strictly

00:56:54,970 --> 00:57:20,980
for tablet yes yeah yeah so so yeah so

00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:25,119
you can go 100 Oh actually this is

00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:29,499
pixels 100% you could use you poor

00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:31,920
viewport with pixels or percentage then

00:57:29,499 --> 00:57:31,920
you could change

00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,250
according to the page builders say they

00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,430
claim that they can work with any theme

00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:58,700
so so so the answer the short answer is

00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:00,350
yes it'll work but there's there

00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:04,250
sometimes there's PHP err sometimes

00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:05,840
there's loading issues and stuff so the

00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:08,270
short answer is yes but but it it

00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:11,050
depends that I'm not familiar with the

00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,050
theme yes

00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:17,360
