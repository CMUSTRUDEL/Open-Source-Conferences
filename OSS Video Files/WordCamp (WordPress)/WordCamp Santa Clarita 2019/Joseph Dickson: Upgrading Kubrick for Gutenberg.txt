Title: Joseph Dickson: Upgrading Kubrick for Gutenberg
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	Unsurprisingly, last December’s release of WordPress 5.0 made us nervous. Today, some of our themes are in need of extensive upgrades.
While reviewing the oldest of such designs, 2005’s classic default theme Kubrick. We’ll rediscover why it is important to WordPress’ past and discuss new opportunities. In this session, Kubrick’s design will be applied to blocks allowing users to anticipate exactly what to expect before they hit publish.
If we can modernize Kubrick for Gutenberg in 2019, we can do anything.

	00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,439
my talk is gonna probably go a little

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,210
short so I'll give people five minutes

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,660
to wander in so I'll just do like a

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,960
really long introduction and and then

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,230
I'll go into the talk so my name is

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,600
Joseph Dixon and that is my twitter

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:42,750
handle I've been using that Twitter

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:45,540
handle since before Twitter and AOL days

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,370
so that was before people used their

00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,949
real names on Twitter so I thought I was

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,600
being really clever so yeah graduated

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,059
high school in the 90s and and that

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,540
jofre ska handle still lives with me

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,330
today my website is Joseph - Dixon

00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,280
dot-com the - is important because

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,400
there's another Joseph Dixon in Canada

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,860
who had his website hacked and the guy

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,350
tried to sell his website to me which

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,509
was actually kind of amusing so he was a

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,450
politician in Canada he didn't pay for

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,280
his web hosting it got cyber squatted I

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,100
guess that's technically not hacked

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,870
he got cyber squatted and I got a lot of

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,470
traffic from Canada for a few days

00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,570
people thinking I was him and then a

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,980
couple weeks ago he contacted me on my

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,800
gmail account trying to sell me the

00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,710
account not the Canadian politician but

00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,750
the the guy that stole it which was

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,610
which was nice I told him no and he

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,610
hasn't emailed me back which was was

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,740
awesome actually I'm a web developer at

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,510
Pitzer College that's a small liberal

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,280
arts college in claremont california

00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:55,560
with about 1,100 students so we use

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,140
wordpress for the entire front end of

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,000
our website and i'm also a member of the

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:07,549
Inland Empire meetup group what what I'm

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,470
a big fan of a big fan of WordPress so

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,390
let me see what other random trivia

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,799
trivia about me can I stretch this

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:20,280
introduction out for a few more minutes

00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:22,950
oh I do have a question I do have an

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,200
answer for your question earlier it was

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,689
automatic that did some Guttenberg Jenga

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,730
blocks and I think I saw somebody had

00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,069
them at a word camp late last year

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,500
yeah they were Jenga blocks with like

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,890
with like the different automatic

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:43,459
properties like like on them so now that

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:47,010
it's on video I hope I'm not wrong and

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:54,180
then alright so let's go ahead and get

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:57,510
started okay so this is what I was

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,780
working on the Kubrick theme if you're

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,660
not familiar with it was designed in

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,019
2004 and became a default theme for

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:12,030
WordPress in 2006 it has not received

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:17,360
any updates since 2010 and that's why I

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:21,780
decided it would be a fantastic item to

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,340
develop a guttenberg to prepare for

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,599
Gutenberg right because I would set it

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,370
up I would get all these all these error

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,049
messages right I would run it through a

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,989
debugger and find out that it's running

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,850
a ton of different deprecated functions

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,209
this would be a so to appear as though

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,850
my website has not been updated in in 9

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,700
years and so I actually fixed those

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,780
those features pretty quickly

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,450
surprisingly the only error that I

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,870
solved like right up front was the the

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,000
sidebar here completely disappeared

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,920
after they stopped updating the theme

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,500
they changed how sidebars getting queued

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,720
in WordPress websites so that was really

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,489
the only fix I had to do and naturally

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,310
there's some other things that you could

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:08,130
improve with kubrick but this is more of

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,299
like an experiment in updating it to be

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,549
Gutenberg compatible so for context this

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,889
is a Michael Heilmann I hope I just

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:21,359
pronounced his name correctly and it was

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,770
the default theme from 1.2 to 2.9 so

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,660
they'll give you some context of how

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,030
long it was a default theme now we have

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,190
default themes that basically last one

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,080
whole year and then they get replaced by

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,840
another theme with the exception being

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,650
for 2017 when they didn't release one

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,450
for 2018 so this was a default theme for

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:43,470
for four years and was eventually

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,910
succeeded by the 2010 theme

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,710
which introduced a lot of those new

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,020
template tags and functions that

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,000
WordPress had been developing over the

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,520
previous four years while it was a

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,990
default theme and I forgot to mention

00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:03,330
that is the original that is the

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:06,060
developer of the Qbert theme yeah I mean

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:10,710
he's ball it's just a coincidence I had

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,900
no idea that we were both bald so you

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,360
might be not asking yourselves what did

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,670
the internet look like in 2006 and why

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,760
is Kubrick super important to WordPress

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,430
and so I figured well why not just go to

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,580
the Wayback Machine on archive.org and

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,950
literally take screenshots of some

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:32,790
social media websites which quite

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,590
honestly in 2006 was the competition for

00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,900
WordPress this is back when it was a

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,580
blogging software first and people were

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,360
starting to use it for business

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:45,780
so that's your facebook login page from

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,700
2006 ya know they I mean the color

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,490
palettes still the same I don't know

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,110
what myspace looks like today but if if

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,180
you guys are interested apparently they

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,700
had a really good article and faster

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,450
than the Furious drifting right around

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:03,030
June of 2006 so so you guys could check

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:06,500
that out for your Fast and the Furious

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,500
Tok Tokyo Drift

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,630
Twitter this is funny

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,720
now I have a feeling that this is

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,060
probably a CSS error in the Twitter

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,919
platform when I was using Twitter at

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,110
this time this is before we had smart

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,550
phones the iPhone didn't come out until

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,330
the following year

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:29,400
so people were using Twitter on the

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,380
website but I was actually using it on

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,470
my phone you know you'd sign up for an

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,570
account you would tweet a message to I

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,610
think it's four oh four oh four is the

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,260
phone number and you would send out

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,880
tweets and back then it was just me

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,040
tweeting to the three other people I

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,270
know in real life at that time we were

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:51,450
just doing it as group text messages and

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,910
YouTube in 2006 was this way before

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,620
Google bought them out this is back when

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,900
they were the video blogging service

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,310
so if you take a it's a little blurry

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,630
here but if you were to take a closer

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,740
look at the screen grab you could see

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,890
that a lot of these things were just

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,060
people video blogging I did forget to

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,040
mention I think at the beginning of the

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,240
video that these slides are available at

00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,950
my at my website there in the footer so

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,850
if you guys wanted to follow along on

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:25,660
your laptop you can so the cube

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:29,890
recurrent theme by contrast was easy to

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:34,510
use I had a clean design was some very

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:36,490
simple and extremely modern back around

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,190
this time I worked at a newspaper right

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,650
and I was a web developer back then as

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,480
well the idea was always get everything

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,070
above the fold why I could tell you

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,140
right now my editor would freak out if

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:51,010
they saw how big that header banner was

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:54,790
in 2006 because that was the idea people

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:57,970
had computer monitors that were 1024 by

00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,100
768 so you know you'd probably see the

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,990
first third of this page but if you're

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,010
using it for browsing and reading then

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,320
it's it was very clean and easy to read

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:11,410
it's impossible to read now at 13 pixel

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,560
font size but back then it looked a lot

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:19,960
larger so getting to the meat of this

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:24,250
presentation the idea was to analyze

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,600
what Kubrick looked like I updated it a

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,340
bit you could see a little mistake there

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,550
on my search box this is actually a

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:33,250
theme that I had forked and I started to

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,690
get it to work and you'll notice that

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:39,730
I'm running it on a local host that's

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:41,650
using a WTP WPD bug that will show up

00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,660
alerts and messages if there's something

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,940
wrong with the code so it's pretty clean

00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,710
the search box is the only thing broken

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,470
that I noticed and this is the the

00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,480
inside page so so Kubrick was really

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:59,740
simple it had a front page and it had

00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:01,210
interior pages and you know naturally

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,810
you're gonna say to yourself well why

00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,790
would I want to update such an old

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,490
website for Gutenberg and that is a

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,089
legitimate question because you have to

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,730
ask yourself

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:15,850
I'm gonna spend 20 maybe 30 hours coding

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,589
the the inside of the dashboard to look

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,129
like the front end of the website on old

00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:23,290
old theme so ask yourself would it even

00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:26,139
be beneficial to yourself or your client

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,930
to to use it in the first place one of

00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,910
the items that that I'll notice is like

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,759
well blocks are super easy to deploy

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,459
right so if you needed to create a

00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,959
button with some text on it you could do

00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,790
that in like a matter of a couple

00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,029
seconds whereas if you did it in the

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:45,249
classic editor you'd have to go do some

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:48,430
some class tag hackery maybe even a

00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:50,410
short code and then again ask yourself

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,959
well should I just be redesigning the

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,879
website and I mean you know if we're

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,100
gonna be using Gutenberg maybe we should

00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,990
just like reanalyze whether or not this

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,930
website has any other problems that need

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,819
to be addressed so it's a good time to

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:07,149
think okay well maybe I'll redesign it

00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:11,860
after during the use Gutenberg in the

00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:14,110
redesign process additionally this is

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,970
what I found in personal practice if you

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,129
switch somebody from classic editor

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,860
Gutenberg you also have to adopt their

00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:22,959
their training right I work at a college

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,100
some of my co-workers and colleagues

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,620
have been using it for three or four

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,149
years and as soon as you change that

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,559
dashboard they're gonna be like this

00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,660
looks nothing like what I was using

00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:35,410
yesterday and they call you on the phone

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,629
they send you an email and it's it's I

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,429
still find myself like referencing

00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:41,350
documents on how to do something or I'll

00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:44,009
discover some hidden feature in

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,089
Gutenberg that I didn't know about

00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:47,649
Gutenberg has a way of hiding things

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,540
under contextual menus that are

00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,040
literally hidden you hover over

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,559
something and then suddenly a little

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,110
plus icon shows up and that is just

00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:59,100
really frustrating but it is clean so

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:03,459
once you get used to it it's good to use

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,139
so chances are you've at least installed

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,879
Gutenberg for a few minutes so this will

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:09,639
look familiar to you this is the default

00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,199
styles that if your theme does not

00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:15,069
support Gutenberg you'll end up with

00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:18,879
this large serif font header followed by

00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:20,769
a paragraph of text a QWOP quote block

00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,689
all these things were the default blocks

00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,370
you would find in the editor but what if

00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:28,480
what if

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:31,540
it looked like the theme itself and this

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,019
is actually key I found that when I

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,240
started editing my themes for the back

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,579
end to look more like the front end it

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,559
actually saved the clients being my

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:43,899
co-workers and colleagues a little bit

00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,180
of time if they floated an image to the

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:48,249
left or to the right then it would look

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,649
something like this on the front end so

00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,540
sometimes people get concerned about the

00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:54,370
line-break of a word showing up right

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,529
next to an image in a particular spot

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,569
and they'll edit the text to get it to

00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,360
land there it's just little things like

00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:02,740
that so if you can customize the backend

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,050
of the website to look like the front

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,019
end you can save some time for the

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,870
people developing the software Jason

00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:13,420
yesterday morning was presenting on

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:18,370
Elementor and block editors in general

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,290
and block block page builders page

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,029
builders and what he was saying was

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,550
effectively what I hear from everyone

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:26,199
else who doesn't want to develop is like

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,209
I just want to know what the websites

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,850
gonna look like before I hit publish and

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,829
this is kind of a gray area in between

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,350
that can allow you to do a little bit of

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:37,839
that without having to install a page

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,550
builder so during the rest of this talk

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,519
I'll be showing you how you can go in

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:47,529
and override some of your design changes

00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:50,709
to do something like this the first part

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:53,410
is learning how to in cue block styles

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,540
the the top one is the one that we'll be

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,870
covering today because this is a classic

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,149
theme that was designed before before

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,559
the before Guttenberg but there are two

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,790
other functions you can have the style

00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,730
show up on the front end of the website

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:12,189
end on the back end or even just on the

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,319
front end of the website those will be

00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:17,050
used for different reasons so let's say

00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:18,939
you're building a theme today from

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,879
scratch you'd probably want to use the

00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:23,499
second option in cue block assets

00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,779
because then that way you're only

00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:28,779
setting up your design styles once and

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:31,689
it goes in both places the last one

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:34,990
let's say you're designing website today

00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:37,209
and you know that you're going to be

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,930
using classic editor for a while then

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,910
then

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,430
you could just throw them over to the

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:45,520
front end and and not worry about what

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,140
looks like on the block editor it's it's

00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,820
kind of a backwards way of thinking

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,520
because if you install Guttenberg it

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,500
wouldn't work on the on the back end but

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,630
there's reasons for that so we're gonna

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,640
be talking about just styling the editor

00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:02,140
for the rest of this talk and that is in

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:04,330
cube block editor assets so I'll have

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,080
that a the slides are on my website if

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:10,720
you guys want to inspect it later this

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,540
is what an entire code block would look

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,670
like in functions.php if you wanted to

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,649
in cue the block editor styles so

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,680
starting at the top we we build the

00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,990
function we we in cue the style sheet

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,209
I'm giving it a name of Gutenberg editor

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,670
CSS that way if I look at the source

00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:30,940
code later on I'll know that this is

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,100
pulling in the Gutenberg editor CSS I

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,390
should not be seeing this on the front

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,610
end of the website but I should be

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,820
seeing it if I do an inspection on on

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,709
the on the editor if I'm seeing it in

00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,850
both places then I probably in cute and

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:49,029
cute it with the wrong with the wrong

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,250
assets there on the right and then of

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:56,470
course the path where the the CSS file

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:58,330
is located so because there is I lost

00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,830
count of how many core blocks there are

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,320
on Gutenberg and they're adding a few

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,540
new ones every couple months I'm only

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,720
going to be covering four no one's got

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,750
time to go over every single video embed

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,470
block from the 12 different video

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:17,320
services that they have included so the

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,680
first one is a clockwise from top top

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,100
around would be the title block the

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,560
paragraph block the quote block on the

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,050
right and the list block on the left all

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,470
of these have unique styles for Kubrick

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:34,570
so they're also tend to be the most used

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:40,660
when you're developing a informational

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:45,040
website so that's really low resolution

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:49,870
guys I'm so sorry the the what is a

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,790
happening here is I inspect the the

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,070
editor while I'm working on it

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,000
right to see what CSS classes I'm going

00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:00,670
to need to override in order to get the

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,480
the title to look the way I want it to

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:06,880
so on the left you have the the class

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,000
tags that I ended up overriding for my

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,440
theme that allows me to change the font

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,290
and the size and all the other

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,900
information so in this case you'll see

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,090
some similarities as I flip through the

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,100
rest of the slide presentation the

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,160
reference to the word editor the

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,950
reference to what it does and then

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,670
underscore underscore something else and

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,990
that it's it's it's a repeated method so

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,720
that developers know what they're

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,790
editing I don't know if it mentions it

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,820
in the handbook just yet but but I'd

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:42,700
been noticing a pattern so I might as

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,650
well work with it I'm sorry I forgot to

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,740
mention so what I'm doing here is

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,620
setting the font family to liberation

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,820
sans which is kind of like Arial and and

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:56,820
Helvetica and then fallback is a sans

00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,170
serif font and adjusting the line height

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,160
the reason I'm doing that is I want to

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,980
get rid of some of that additional

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,100
padding on the titles because the

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:11,550
default Gutenberg styles are this really

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:15,040
big title and Kubrick was was tiny so

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,930
also edit overwriting the editor with

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,900
something I've noticed in the other

00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:22,780
direction is that the blocks are very

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,940
narrow in in Gutenberg and the front end

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,590
of themes tend to be very wide in this

00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:30,160
case it's actually the opposite so I

00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:31,900
needed to change the max width to 480

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,940
pixels so I could squeeze it a little

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,350
bit but you can go in the other

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,050
direction

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:40,720
WP block is more of a general class tag

00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,760
that applies to all the blocks and so

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,730
you know I set the font family and the

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,560
sans-serif and the line height and all

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,560
this stuff that I would like to see flow

00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,570
further on into the process so if it

00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:57,480
doesn't really work and I'll go on to

00:17:52,570 --> 00:18:00,130
that in a later slide it's because

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,560
there's a lot of inline CSS in

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,230
Guttenberg right now and I'm hoping that

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:09,159
it gets addressed later on but

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,690
by simply inspecting and and grabbing

00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,340
the paragraph block and that's all I'm

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,320
really doing is saying okay if it's a

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,840
paragraph and it's in the editor Styles

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,480
wrapper then set the font size to 13

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,549
pixels and the line height to 1.4 really

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,220
simple right I don't want it to be 18

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:26,760
pixels and and super spaced out that's

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,990
not what my theme is looking for

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,139
unfortunately I had to use important

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,710
tags because the way that the JavaScript

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:38,429
works in Gutenberg when you focus on a

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,320
block when you start editing the block

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:43,690
JavaScript and class tags start showing

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,919
up it's very responsive to your whether

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,320
or not you're inputting with that

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,230
particular block or not and that affects

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,630
some of your styles so in practice what

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,179
I found myself happening while I was

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,010
editing this particular block is I'd be

00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,990
like oh great it looks great it's 13

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,549
pixels the line height is perfect looks

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,590
just like the front end then I would

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:04,389
click on it to edit the text and the

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,399
line height would increase and then I

00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:08,169
would unclick it and it would squeeze

00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:10,240
back down sometimes it wouldn't even

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:13,950
squeeze back down so the last thing you

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:19,980
want is bouncing text in your editor so

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:22,570
important tags fortunately no

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:26,860
unfortunately the list block is really

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:28,630
busy same method the list block you you

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,070
actually have to default blocks a large

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,460
no sorry

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,269
ordered lists and unordered lists so

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:41,559
there's a lot of code to go with that

00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:44,470
same idea identifying which class tags

00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,630
are in the editor and then overriding

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,419
them so you see a lot of repeated

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:52,600
references the line height for one point

00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:54,519
three for whatever reason this this

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,049
theme wanted to make the lists a little

00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,029
bit smaller line height they didn't

00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:00,070
repeat the exact same line height in the

00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:02,139
design but I still had to run an

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:08,139
important tag through it because of some

00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:12,279
CSS issues the next one is the font size

00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:14,710
and the padding above and below the list

00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:19,030
elements to try to squeeze them up a

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:22,720
little bit and the the padding left

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:27,220
the the standard block in this theme if

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,170
you're doing a an unordered list it will

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,230
Pat it over to the right make it look

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,510
more it's not in the same alignment as a

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:48,040
paragraph block but the ordered lists

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:55,830
works six months is watching this video

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:58,240
and laughing right now okay sounds great

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:01,780
so the remainder of this code is just

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,760
styling the the back end of the editor

00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,310
to look like the front end so a lot of

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,200
what I was working on at this point was

00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,270
referencing the original stylesheet and

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,400
code from the original developer and

00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:15,880
trying to apply it to the back end and

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,650
and and doing a lot of a lot of code

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:23,620
because none of his code will show up in

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:27,700
the block editor I liked this one

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:32,680
because it only had four lines and it

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,690
still had its own weirdness and the

00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,230
quote block has two options in

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:43,630
Guttenberg you have the large quote and

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm guessing the is not large so if you

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,920
take a closer look at that top line

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,500
right there there is a pseudo class in

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,620
that class tag what that is trying to do

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,950
is saying okay if this is not the large

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,720
block then apply these styles well one

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,150
of the problems I ran into that isn't

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,510
sort of directly related to this project

00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,760
is if you're adding additional quote

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,890
blocks to the core blocks because you

00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,840
could extend core blocks in Gutenberg

00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,730
which makes it really great if you have

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,560
a block that does 90% of what you want

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,390
to do and you want to adjust it so you

00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,310
create a third version right no big deal

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,070
well then these styles would apply that

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:25,540
one too unless of course it was labeled

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:28,270
is style large in the class tag so that

00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,010
that had its own little issues I know

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,650
that's a bit of an aside but if you ever

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:36,070
get into it it made things

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:39,720
little tricky no doubt there's a lot of

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:43,030
trial and error in overwriting the

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:47,590
Gutenberg styles and a lot of inline CSS

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:49,990
that required me to go in and use the

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,930
important tag I found it kind of

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,580
frustrating because I I kind of pride

00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,470
myself in not using the important tag

00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,970
I've been doing CSS long enough that I

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:05,770
know if I have to use it it's not

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:08,920
because of me so testing the CSS

00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,980
overrides on the left you have my my

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,180
block themes so you'll see some

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,030
commonalities there with the underscores

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,670
the post title it gives you an idea of

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:21,100
where the CSS is going there's

00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:24,490
references to wrappers for the paragraph

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,080
block but you know this tells you that

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,360
the code that I'm writing is just gonna

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,270
be for the post editor itself and this

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:35,530
is the style from the original theme

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:40,170
itself and actually the end of the style

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:43,000
sheet which is a surprising 731 lines of

00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:46,990
CSS this guy was really lean with his

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,110
work and a reference to a quote at the

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:55,840
end of 2001 a Space Odyssey where Hal

00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:57,880
9000 is singing Daisy Daisy as he's

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,600
getting shut down which is why the theme

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,090
was nicknamed Kubrick if you look for it

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,400
in in a theme archive it'll just say

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,260
default theme but people in the

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
community refer to it as Kubrick theme

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:16,900
and it's because of that little line of

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:22,450
code yeah yeah yeah so this is a before

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:24,670
and after of the the editor where the

00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:27,130
the fonts were the default styles and

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:30,340
then what I was able to work on in a

00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:32,830
couple hours of CSS work to make the the

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,500
front end and the back end look more

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:38,680
alike and more importantly this is what

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,740
I was going for making it so that if

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,180
somebody is editing on the back end they

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,310
know what it will look like before they

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,500
hit publish or schedule because if we're

00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,270
working on a website

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,030
especially what I do with and in higher

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,890
education is I'll want to post a press

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,570
release and I'll kind of want to know

00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,060
what it will look like before I schedule

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,590
it for three weeks out and this is kind

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,380
of like that sure you could use the

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:04,110
preview button but this will save you

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,120
literally seconds every single time you

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,530
would have maybe hit that preview button

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,050
and that doesn't sound like that big of

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:15,680
a deal but if you've seen how low that

00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:19,290
these how slow that some page page

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,140
builders will edit with I mean come on

00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,610
they have a loading sequence you know

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,500
this this will save you a little bit of

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,020
time and this is all stuff that you

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,180
could do in core without installing

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,270
additional plugins it just means that

00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:36,180
you're gonna have to edit some CSS

00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,910
create your own CSS and drop it into

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:43,890
your child theme or over your original

00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:46,110
theme so oh I up look you guys missed

00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,700
the animation on this because I uploaded

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,420
it to Google slides and it's no longer

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,850
animated I know I'm sorry I mean I'm

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,500
sure you guys have all seen 2001 a Space

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,390
Odyssey so I'll just tell you it's just

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,060
him asking how to open the pod bay doors

00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,650
in a loop for like two seconds which is

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,010
kind of what it's like working with

00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:07,680
Guttenberg right you're like all I want

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,350
to do is get to this button to go right

00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:15,570
here just right there just right there

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:20,130
why is it not that way so yeah yeah no

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,390
kidding so quite frankly possible nests

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,240
that next steps you guys might be

00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,940
interested in is you know go in and

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,910
queue the block the block editor start

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,740
with WP - block and see what kind of

00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,140
styles that you can adjust for you

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,570
yourself or your clients website that

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,970
will just adjust the width or whatever

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,950
and start playing with it you could

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,530
visit the Gutenberg Handbook it the

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,660
documentation is really getting good

00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,010
it's written in such a way where you

00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,500
kind of have to start on the first page

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:52,050
and flip through it like an actual novel

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,700
which is a little strange because I like

00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,490
to go through stuff like Stack Overflow

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,740
style and just find the solution like at

00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,910
the bottom of the screen the everyone

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,660
uploaded ya know

00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:05,190
the handbook is not written that way so

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,760
so it's best to just read it left to

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:11,400
right up to down and heck why not watch

00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,890
2001 a Space Odyssey while coding or

00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,750
your other favorite movie and then just

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,240
throw a little quote at the bottom of it

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:21,300
just to see if anyone references it you

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,490
know a couple years later part of the

00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,310
reason I wanted to give this talk is as

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,690
an example I hear this a lot from from

00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,360
meetups and friends who also use

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:34,020
WordPress is that they're scared of

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,000
Gutenberg and and yeah it's it will have

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,150
a time commitment to learn how to edit

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,370
and work with it but the payoff is down

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,280
the road once once you get a few things

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:46,350
under your belt it's actually really

00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,740
responsive and quick to use I started

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,250
using Gutenberg in ways that I didn't

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,600
think I would

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:56,730
I used Evernote as a notebook I've used

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,340
other different type of apps now I could

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,620
just use my wordpress dashboard and you

00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,140
know I there's like little tricks in

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,450
Gutenberg like you can like hit return

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,890
and it creates a new block right but did

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,350
any of you guys know that you could just

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:13,710
hit slash and start typing and you could

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,480
search for the blocks yeah yeah I really

00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,820
should have put that in the slide show

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,290
because that's probably the one largest

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,210
thing that you guys are gonna hit like

00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,920
want to check out later so create a

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,950
block hit the slash right next to your

00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,360
Shift key and start typing and and so if

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,250
you're looking for image block it'll

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,840
just pop up right there so what you

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,360
could do is just start tabbing through

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,430
and they've made so many accessibility

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,830
improvements to Guttenberg that the

00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:41,070
workflow of typing and writing in

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:45,720
Gutenberg is so streamlined that I don't

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:48,660
even bother using LibreOffice or

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,090
Microsoft Word I just start editing and

00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,010
working in the in the editor I mean I'm

00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,900
writing for myself right so I'm not

00:28:53,010 --> 00:29:01,080
gonna have to share it with a another

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:03,360
editor so that that's all on the

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,120
presentation and I did finish a little

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:10,380
early about 15 20 minutes early I'm

00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,030
hoping you guys have some questions yeah

00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,420
question time let's go to let's go into

00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,420
questions

00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:20,940
well I was getting livid lost earlier

00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:25,410
are those all in function PHP like like

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:28,050
to to to to work on your wig is it all

00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:31,620
in functions PHP like those blogs over

00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:37,320
these here yeah oh this is my my block

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:39,300
CSS file yeah yeah so wait your it

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,750
probably didn't pick up your question he

00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:45,480
was asking if this code here was in PHP

00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:47,700
it's actually in CSS man it would have

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,290
been so much nicer if I put CSS at the

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:54,990
beginning of this slide thank you for

00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:58,200
referencing that yeah now I probably

00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:00,420
know this is the only part that was PHP

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,150
in the presentation and and you're right

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,850
I didn't have a PHP tag at the beginning

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:09,390
in the end of this to provide a hint so

00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:11,610
it looks very similar so this is the

00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,230
only PHP you would have to do is add

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:30,140
something like this to your functions

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:34,650
tag to reference a style sheet sure no

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:37,050
no I do

00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:39,750
I actually okay thank you for that I I

00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:43,230
have the code on github if you want to

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:45,810
download it I ask that you do not use it

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,180
on a production website that you do it

00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,970
in a safe space that's not going to eat

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,470
any content because all I did was edit

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,420
those three or four blocks and

00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:57,450
everything else on that is not

00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,280
Guttenberg ready but yeah if you want to

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,990
see the code in the blocks I'm gonna be

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,840
adding the code to my post on my website

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:07,050
but also the you could you could follow

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,880
it on on github if you wanted to check

00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,640
it out I might actually go back there

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,500
and make a few small edits over time the

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,270
problem with Guttenberg isn't

00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,060
Gutenberg's fault it's just not

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:23,370
responsive and people don't look at 13

00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:26,310
pixel fonts on on their their desktop 4k

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,020
screens so if you if

00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,570
if you guys thought that this is very

00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:33,210
hard to read it's hard to read for a

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:37,370
reason it's because we don't we don't

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,370
consume websites the same way today and

00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:48,840
okay well you might wanna you might want

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,180
to fork the the project you're free to

00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,410
do so over there in github and then fix

00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,410
all the errors that I haven't addressed

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:10,950
there is I don't remember the developers

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:14,970
name but his talk is on WordPress TV and

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:18,270
his talk was from I want to say 2014

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,770
where he literally went through did the

00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,860
same thing I did so it would work with

00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:26,640
WordPress but before Gutenberg and he

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,200
audited audited the code and so for

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,870
instance he turned this background image

00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,630
into an actual CSS background and

00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:36,510
rounded the edges and it works on phones

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:38,610
I didn't do that but you know what I

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,740
might I might fork his project too and

00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:43,620
save myself some time and then you know

00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:47,940
I can call this a Kubrick 3.0 or

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:56,250
something or 5.0 and make no money off

00:32:47,940 --> 00:33:02,430
of it 2010 yeah I could do that but it's

00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:05,490
still 9 years old oh oh I got you to

00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:10,740
2010 yeah yeah but that wasn't that

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:18,710
wasn't filmed by Stanley Kubrick okay

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:21,690
question what would you say you really

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:24,039
pulled out of this project why

00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,740
okay that's a really good question

00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:30,070
because this was the first thing that I

00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:32,919
had done in Gutenberg and it's kind of

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:35,799
like you most most of you are designers

00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:38,230
you and you might inherit a website from

00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:41,110
somebody that has not been redesigned in

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:44,110
five years and they hand you a theme and

00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:47,320
and they say to you I really love this

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,510
website can you make it work and this is

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,000
kind of that process right you don't

00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,830
have to throw out the old code you can

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,409
go in you could refactor it you can

00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:00,820
audit it and you can customize it for

00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:02,740
Gutenberg so that it's modern again that

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,110
was really really what I was trying to

00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,480
get through it also taught me that I

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:11,500
don't have to go in and add additional

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,290
blocks from plugins I could just go into

00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,940
my theme and add adjustments and then

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,609
that website will literally just have

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,139
the theme and and core WordPress and

00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:23,220
that just means I have to hit update

00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:27,129
less frequently which saves me time on

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:48,159
maintaining a website any other

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:49,690
questions in the back it's been four

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,909
months yeah

00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:56,349
Gutenberg was released in December and

00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:59,410
it's still not here and and yes it is in

00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:02,109
a way and on the function slide that's

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,910
kind of what's going on here is that

00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:09,010
let's if you plan out your CSS correctly

00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:11,140
well if you plan out your CSS saying

00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:14,380
correct would be inaccurate because any

00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:17,080
way you use it as your web using it if

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,609
you plan it out you could say okay well

00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,220
I know these blocks are gonna be on my

00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:23,710
website I'm going to literally write a

00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,890
style sheet that applies to every single

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:29,349
Guttenberg block and so you can in queue

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:31,510
your blocks on the back end and the

00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:33,070
front end and then anything else that

00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,780
isn't related to your blocks you could

00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,369
place in another style sheet or you

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,560
could place them in the same style sheet

00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,720
if they don't conflict with each other

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,280
because at the end of the day your back

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,050
end is still going to be the back end

00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,170
and you don't want all those extra

00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:49,570
Styles interfering with your admin bar

00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,369
or doing some other weirdness so so you

00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,859
could do them in both places and I think

00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:55,420
that what you said about the the front

00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:57,490
end of the back end looking the same I

00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,220
think that what they're referring to is

00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:01,390
the third one where no the second one

00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:08,970
where you're doing it on the front end

00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:14,010
of the back end any other questions okay

00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:19,170
we are super early so I guess that's it

00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:19,170
you want me to put on the wig all right

00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:26,609
let's see in the Guyver wig I got to

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,609
touch them

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,900
so david was a hacking Guttenberg for

00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,740
what was that no what was the name of

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,740
your talk earlier today

00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:52,280
yes MacGyver plays the Box I yeah but I

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,110
really did feel like I was macgyvering I

00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,740
really did feel like I was in the guy

00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:59,120
Vereen Guttenberg in the sense that as

00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,890
you could see when I was going through

00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,930
some of the slides some of the CSS I had

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,910
to apply in some places didn't work in

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:08,210
others so I had to literally go through

00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:10,580
and fiddle like crazy I spent more time

00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:14,420
working on that CSS than I did the slide

00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:51,850
presentation for for this so I think

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:51,850
that shows so awesome yeah I mean

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,470
Gutenberg has a lot of features that are

00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:59,660
not implemented and a lot of blocks that

00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:01,840
I I think that are missing from core

00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:05,600
blocks when I made that joke about

00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,190
having a video embed if you go through

00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,080
and look at every single core block

00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,330
there is at last count it's about 40

00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,610
about half of those are video embeds for

00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,620
different platforms I would really

00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:18,020
really like them to spend the time on

00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,760
having a list thing where you could put

00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,730
a little check box and you could check

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:27,320
things off and like make a checklist

00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:29,480
rather than ABS is that a dunce dog yeah

00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,330
so I mean there's a reason right there

00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,630
anyone listening today you can create a

00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:38,090
block and then make billions of Internet

00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:40,970
dollars just for having a check box

00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:45,320
some people get checked stuff off fun

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:48,650
times like a checklist block I mean come

00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,780
I like like no seriously how many times

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:54,440
have you gone in and and went into your

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,190
email and no not email but google it at

00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,800
Google

00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,630
what's the Google list keep cool keep

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,300
has a block that you could check off

00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:11,090
right we could be able to do that in

00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:12,930
WordPress yeah so awesome thanks

00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:18,400
everyone

00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:18,400
