it's one of the voices that you really

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,450
need to hear in the WooCommerce space

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,580
I think he's gonna present a topic today

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,860
how to use a data-driven approach to

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,360
optimize your ecommerce store for

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:19,590
incredible results Chris limo

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:23,640
thank you I don't know if you have ever

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,060
received an email right that you know

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,609
immediately was not meant for you my

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,899
name is Chris my full name is Christian

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,670
it is not Christ so if I get an email

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,680
that sent to me dear Christ I'm like

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,950
what I'm reading someone else's email

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,329
this is not mine but you also get other

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,020
kinds of emails that aren't for you

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:51,120
right like maybe you went and stayed at

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:54,800
a hotel in another city because you were

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,609
there for a friend's wedding or worse

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,789
for a relative's funeral I went to a

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,909
funeral I stayed at a hotel a year later

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,409
they sent me an email and said it's been

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,010
a year we haven't seen you when are you

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:15,240
coming back that's not the kind of email

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:19,320
that I wanted right and that's because

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,720
more often than not most people in the

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,630
regular business world and in the

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,820
e-commerce world do not do enough with

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,470
segmentation so we're gonna talk today

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,540
about this idea of understanding

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,189
audiences breaking them down and being

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,560
effective with that right that's what

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,159
segmentation is all about so let's get

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,979
started

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,280
when we talk about businesses or stores

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,470
most of the time what happens is we talk

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,340
in averages right it looks like this

00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:55,259
when it's the store right purchases

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,570
2,360 here's our total revenue here's

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,450
our number of customers divvied up this

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,040
is we talk about the average in real

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,369
life it looks like this car which by the

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,759
way have any of you ever owned a 2001

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,580
Pontiac Aztek thank God because I don't

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,160
want to sit here mocking it and

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,410
find out that was your favorite car this

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,020
was car designed by committee right this

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,240
was trying to hit every segment of the

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,180
market all in one in fact you can't tell

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:27,560
but this back part of the car popped

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,570
open and a tent was attached there was

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,790
an attempt because you know when you're

00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,960
thinking about cars and driving in the

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,610
supermarket you're like but what if I

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,270
want to have a tent in the back right

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,220
so people who owned this car loved it

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,020
right because it had everything it like

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,040
there was something in it for the

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,090
husband something in it for the wife

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,220
something in it for the kids like

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,930
everybody there was power adapters for

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,230
every kind of device you might want to

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:54,260
charge in the back but it has been

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:58,730
ranked consistently for years as in the

00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:01,430
top five worst cars ever right why

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,080
because the people who made it played

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,850
with the averages they didn't talk to a

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,150
specific type of person and say how do

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,980
we get a perfect camping vehicle or how

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,630
do we go they just said let's get the

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,310
perk vehicle for the campers and for the

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,260
shoppers and for the soccer moms and for

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,290
the wit on and on and you end up with

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,870
this horrific mess all right but what if

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,430
you step away from averages right that

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,459
store with the data that I was showing

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,760
you on the side well it had an average

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:32,830
order value or what we call AOV of 68

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:38,019
dollars but 32 customers had an AO v of

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:40,220
$195 32 of their customers had

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,470
significantly better average order

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,540
values than the average the same thing

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,540
happened when we talked about LTV the

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,100
lifetime value of a customer right if

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,330
you think about how often they're gonna

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,680
stay with you and how often they're

00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,510
gonna buy from you and the average

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,320
amount they're gonna buy each time you

00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:01,040
sum all that up you get lifetime value

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:04,790
210 customers had LTVs of 185 instead of

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,380
76 the trick in e-commerce is not to

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,269
play the averages is not to talk about

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,030
the averages instead it's to find the

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,560
pockets of people that are distinguished

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,530
different enough that you can do

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,510
something with right so if you want to

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,450
drive revenue growth with your online

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,190
store you need to think about

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,240
segmentation you need to focus on

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,979
segmentation

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,090
okay this is j.crew how many of you have

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:32,000
heard of the brand

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,110
j.crew awesome okay let's talk about him

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,039
I come to this site right and if you

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:43,009
take a look up here right you'll see

00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,380
they have men in the there is a label up

00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,550
there that says men that means I should

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,039
be able to shop there right

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,389
so I go to j.crew I click on men I look

00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,389
at t-shirts I look at shoes I look at

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:56,090
all sorts of stuff and when I come back

00:04:53,389 --> 00:05:00,970
to the homepage it still looks exactly

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:04,520
like this even though my behavior

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:08,389
suggested that I am someone who would

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,509
like to look at male clothing their

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,979
homepage didn't change now I want you to

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:14,900
think about this for a second imagine if

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,639
I go into a car dealership law right

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,759
pick whatever car is your favorite car

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,759
imagine I go to a Volkswagen dealership

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,110
right and I walk to the section of the

00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,639
dealership that has them nicest cars

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,960
what salesperson in the right mind would

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,250
be like well let me take you to one of

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,090
our cheaper models over on this other

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,250
side of the law

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,449
they don't do that they say your

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:43,490
behavior has demonstrated something that

00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:44,990
we should pay attention to right you've

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,909
heard it's not the destination it's the

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,820
journey well an e-commerce it is the

00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:52,159
journey every bit of the journey right

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,599
some people are browsing on Google and

00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,580
then they come to your homepage other

00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,289
people you sent them an email and they

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,969
come straight to your product page from

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,380
the homepage that come to the product

00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,909
page then they go browsing around your

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,440
site looking at categories and other

00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:05,150
things then they come back and put

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,500
something in the cart from the cart they

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,550
decide some things they're going to buy

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,270
and every single click every step they

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,889
take everything they do on that site is

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,719
telling you not only about their

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,780
intentions what they're looking for

00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:24,169
right but also who they are

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,460
and you can make you can leverage that

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:29,900
you can make adjustments to your site

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:32,180
based on that all right so organic

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,490
buyers are people who maybe they browse

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,440
something I bet most of you have done

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,150
this you go to Google you ask it a

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,830
question

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,870
you see several articles you click one

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,700
of the articles right let's say that you

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,250
are trying to deal with the weeds

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,380
problem in your front lawn so you go ask

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,870
it how do I deal with this and you get

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,660
an article and in the article is a link

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,220
to a product right and it's a special

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,080
kind of weed killer that's organic it's

00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,230
healthy it won't hurt your dog so you go

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,690
from the search to the article from the

00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,960
article to the product take the product

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,660
stick in your cart and you buy it but

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,520
imagine that you're not that kind of

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,320
person imagine you're not an organic

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,690
buyer right imagine that you're a

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,060
competitor you're a competitor of

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,430
another weed killer right and you come

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,810
straight to the site do a search find

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,000
the product look it put it in your cart

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,100
just to see what are they charging for

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,020
it and what are they charging what are

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,000
they charging for shipping right you're

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:33,140
in research mode you never buy it

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,100
wouldn't you treat those two people

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,420
differently well of course you would

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,590
except that most the time we just put up

00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,010
a website and then we're just like oh I

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:47,600
hope we get orders then we don't

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:50,780
actually treat anything differently okay

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,850
the point of segmentation is not just to

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,370
break up your audiences but it's to

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,290
understand which of those audiences is

00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,110
going to generate you more revenue and

00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,600
to start serving them better with better

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,230
messaging and better interactivity does

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,730
that make sense

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,270
that's what we're talking about today we

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:11,090
good awesome

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:14,570
all right so you've heard of the 80/20

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,070
principle right Pareto's law 20% of your

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,380
audience is going to give you 80% of

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,270
your revenue I want to tell you that

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,550
it's actually way more skew than that

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,320
five percent of your audience is going

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,780
to drive most of your revenue on your

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,030
store so you need to find the various

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,010
different five percenters and support

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,270
them figure out how to help them figure

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,100
out how to help them push the button

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,360

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,460
down right

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,230
I want to tag them I want to know who

00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,230
they are and I want to make sure that I

00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:00,140
am making sure they feel important and

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,660
special right you can't tell from my

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,419
appearance but I'm not white I've also

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,659
been large for very

00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:10,959
so when I go into a store as a Latino

00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:14,229
man who is heavy right I don't fit the

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,279
profile of I have a here's a guy with a

00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:17,829
lot of money who's gonna buy something

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,519
very expensive so I will walk into a

00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:23,649
store and very quickly right I will know

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,489
whether the salesperson in that store

00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,139
has been trained to discard my

00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:30,339
appearance and treat me as someone who

00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,899
may still spend a lot of money or

00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,659
someone who's just gonna go oh he's just

00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,369
browsing around if I catch the vibe that

00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,889
they don't care for me as a customer I

00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:41,049
just turn around and walk out that's

00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:42,369
fine not a problem with me I'll go find

00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:44,519
it and buy something expensive or else

00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:48,989
but if you walk into certain stores

00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,989
high-end stores right Montblanc

00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,849
for women it would be maybe a fancy

00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:58,089
purse store you go into more expensive

00:11:54,849 --> 00:12:00,549
shops they've trained their staff right

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:02,379
do not judge a book by its cover so I'll

00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:03,819
walk it along then normally if I don't

00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:05,379
want to get chased around by security I

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:06,879
have to dress up to go them all but

00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:08,679
imagine that I'm walking into the mall

00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,209

00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:12,279

we do with all these segments if you can

00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,970
tag the customer if you can figure out

00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,489
quickly what they represent

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,319
you can spend extra time I'm not talking

00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:49,119
about not spending time with people who

00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,729
you decided weren't helpful on time out

00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:55,059
spending extra time with people who you

00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:56,889
go okay let me try and help you right if

00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:59,829
someone comes into my store and buys on

00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:00,939
the very first visit I want to make sure

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:02,229
they get an email from me I want to make

00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:03,699
sure that they know that hey thank you

00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:05,079
so much for trusting us with your money

00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,339
I want to take care of is there anything

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:07,569

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:09,519
hear more about why you made the

00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:11,519
purchase what you did all that to make

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,609
sure that they come back a second time

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,529
right then we have big spenders now big

00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:21,550
spenders is when you look at the

00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:23,290
rich order value right and you say if I

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,329
were to take all the people who've made

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,339
purchases and I stack all their

00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,569
purchases and average out what's the

00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,279
average order by so let's say I go to

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,540
the Apple store right I know the Apple

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,069
store and I buy a phone it cost me a

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,480
thousand bucks I go to the Apple store

00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:35,860
buy a computer cost me three thousand

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,499
II go okay well thousand three thousand

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:47,470

00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:49,269
trips okay this is his average order of

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,680
honey and if my average order value is

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,559
up in the thousands you go that okay

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,439
this is he's the big spender imagine if

00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:59,139
my wife goes in and she buys a case for

00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:02,079
$35 and then she buys a charger for $35

00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:05,740
and then she buys you know a cable for

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:09,490
$20 her average order value is gonna be

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:12,790
like 18 dollars right she's not going to

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,620
be tagged as a big spender right now I

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,100
walk into the Apple store and I feel sad

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,850

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,259
speaking at a conference there and I

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,209

00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:35,759
I'm just waiting for Apple to come up

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,379

00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,889

important VIP shoppers are a little

00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,949

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,510
behind me and I didn't want to get out

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,690
of line where so I just bought it I come

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,680
home and Melissa looks it and goes I

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,380
think this is better than our regular

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,700
beds like who does that what's wrong

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,750
with you and I'm like I wasn't paying

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,280
attention to the price I was just

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,470
looking at the cool features and it's

00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,690
like you know it's adjustable in an air

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:47,020
mattress and she's like you're there's a

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,270
problem with you so VIP shoppers it's

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,490
not about how much you spend it's how

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,620
much you spend over the time that you're

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,840
in a relationship right over the time a

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,250
little total lifetime value if you're in

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,250
the top if you spend a lot of money or

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,870
that place you're a VIP shopper most

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:05,199
active shoppers is different right most

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,030
active customers is do you go over and

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,829
over and over right so again target

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,079
would put Melissa in most active

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,900
customers right because she's there all

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,699
the time years ago I used to live in an

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,069
apartment that was about a block away

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,020
from Barnes Noble for those of you that

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,459
don't remember Barnes Noble it's it's

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,030
like Amazon but in a physical building

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:27,880
so I would walk the block after dinner

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,230
and I would go into Barnes Noble every

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,600
single night that's just what I did

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,610
right I I was single and bored and I

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,840
loved books

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,490
so I'd finished dinner I'd walk the

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,370
block I'd walk in and after about a

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,840
month all the staff at Barnes Noble knew

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,610
who I was and they'd be like Oh Chris

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,690
there's a great new book on political

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,500
science over here there's a great new

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,830
history book over here

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,120
the

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,169
a great but yeah I don't know if you I

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,110
don't know if you're in the cooking but

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:52,480
this recipe book just came in and they

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,970
knew me by name because I went all the

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,740
time and I bought at least a book right

00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,940
I was reading about a book I was

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,549
finishing a book every two or three days

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,620
and so I just kept buying books from

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,630
them right and they were like oh yeah

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,620
he's a very active customer now in the

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,690
case that we were talked about earlier

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,840
two percent of their customers bring in

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:16,210
twenty four percent of their revenue not

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:18,100
in high ticket orders right not not from

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,529
anything special they're not buying the

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,740
most expensive products but they come so

00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:25,149
often right that just this two percent

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,100
of people that show up at one of those

00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:29,049
stores will generate twenty four percent

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,620
of their revenue you want to spend time

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:35,769
paying attention to that then there are

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:38,320
people like my buddy Seth my buddy Seth

00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:40,809
does not know how time works or how the

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,809
value of money works all he knows is a

00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:47,529
coupon is a good thing so my buddy Seth

00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:51,909
is the kind of guy who had spent three

00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:54,100
months analyzing every audio receiver

00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:55,659
home theater equipment in the world

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,019
three months looking at everything and

00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:00,730
searching for coupons and pouring hours

00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,409
and hours into spreadsheets and

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,149
everything else so he could save a

00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:09,130
hundred and twenty dollars on the thing

00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:10,389
and you're like d do you not like my mom

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,870
was like this right

00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:15,730
my mom would drive five miles away to

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,889
the gas station that would give her two

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,610
percent off and you're like you burned

00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:23,620
the gas to get there right but there are

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,179
people who like a deal right and they

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,539
like a deal that's just it right it's a

00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,970
deal

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:31,750
I'm gonna take it there are people who

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:34,389
only ever buy with a coupon now if you

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,990
only ever buy with a coupon what do you

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:40,720
think as a store owner you should do

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,600
send them a coupon right it's a trigger

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,250
like here you go there's a hotel in Half

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,389
Moon Bay that I really love every now

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,860
and then they send me an email that says

00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:50,500
hey we're doing our promotions discount

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,179
whatever that it so happens coincides

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,929
with when we go to Monterey right right

00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:57,220
oh look there's deal yeah let's go right

00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:58,580
there are people who only ever shop

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,320
using coupons

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,880
right know who they are and then there's

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,480
people who put something in the cart and

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,480
took off

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,919
what's your follow up right 70% of the

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,679
items get put in a cart and never get

00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:12,049
purchased right 70% cart abandonment

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,490
that's horrid what are you doing to

00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:21,700
follow up and chase those people down

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:24,230
right just given an option right so I

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,750
work at a company called liquid web

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,600
liquid web is a hosting company

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,610
I am the the VP of products there and

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,309
one of our products is a manager

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,049
commerce hosting platform so we host

00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:37,309
WooCommerce stores and one of the

00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:41,179
partnerships we did was that the company

00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:44,870
called glue dot IO and glue dot IO right

00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:46,610
allows you to have these segments three

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,070
months since last purchased 12 months

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,960
since I purchased lost paying customers

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,630
high average order value first purchased

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,880
VIP big spenders full price customers

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,730
repeat customers value shoppers that's

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,710
the coupon people big ticket spenders

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,620
most active customers rate all of these

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,419
things and it shows you how many orders

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,889
what's the total revenue from that

00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:08,510
segment what's the average order value

00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:12,260
for that segment and what's the LTV it

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:15,230
does that automatically now if you went

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,179
to glue on your own you'd pay 300 hours

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,330
a month of course with our hosting you

00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:21,919
get it included so we really love this

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,029
for a real store it's not if you're a

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,039
little store you're just checking out

00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,330
you probably don't need some of our

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,710
plans or at least we've created some

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,679
other plans that don't have glue in it

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,409
but we built this and the first deal I

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,870
did was with glue because segmentation

00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:37,220
is so critical for your success there

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,990
are ton of other partnerships that we've

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,340
looked at since then you can talk about

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,630
tax you can talk about fraud you can

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,010
talk about shipping there's lots of

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,690
other services but if you don't get

00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,450
segmentation right you don't make money

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,220
if you make money off segmentation then

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,260
suddenly everything else you can spend

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,169
money on right so this was our first

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,179
deal our first partnership right and

00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:57,380
this it does these segments of that you

00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,389
have an implant spreadsheets now if you

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,980
don't use glue and you don't post with

00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:02,419
us that's fine you can totally run

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,519
WooCommerce anywhere but it means you're

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,980
gonna export orders out and then start

00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,299
doing some work in spreadsheets right

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,980
again not the end of the world right

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,150
especially if you let you know I work

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,340
with stores that have

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,570
five orders a day two orders a day

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,100
that's going to mean at the end of the

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,450
month it's not gonna be a lot of work in

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,320
the spreadsheet but you're still gonna

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:24,710
have to do some of it okay

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,530
with or without glue the trick here the

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,690
thing that matters most is you have to

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,730
learn how to tag those customers when

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,080
you see the kind of behavior that we're

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,670
talking about when they're buying

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,470
certain things and another stuff you

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,559
want to be able to tag that customer in

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,420
different ways in your email or CRM

00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,679
system so whether you use convertkit or

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:48,340
MailChimp activecampaign agile CRM and

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,540
some of those products have their own

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,110
plugin that connects to WooCommerce like

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:56,690
convertkit others you can do with WP

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,070
fusion right let me show you what it

00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,809
looks like if you're gonna use double P

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,650
fusion it's really really interesting

00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:05,990
right you can say hey I want you to

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:09,530
automatically create a a record in

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,990
something like convertkit but only for

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,330
customers so only for the role where

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,130
someone made a purchase but when they

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,980
make a purchase what I want you to do is

00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,500
I want you to put a segmentation the new

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,150
customer I want you to put that tag

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,670
against them right now you can do other

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,830
things like specifically in the product

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,300
if they bought a leather bag and if they

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,280
bought a leather bag that wasn't your

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,410
more expensive leather bag right so

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,059
let's say that you're selling several

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,040
different items but one category is

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:38,450
leather bag and in that category you

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,880
know that there's three or four bags

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,679
that are the signals that like this guy

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,830
or gal is spending good money on a

00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,720
leather bag so you in the convertkit

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,510
extension for WooCommerce you go in and

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,440
you say hey tag them if they buy this

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:56,960
product tag them as category spender in

00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,660
bags right then if you're using

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,640
something like beaver builder right this

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,280
is the heading module in beaver builder

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,860
you can come to visibility and in

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,620
display you can say look for the user

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:13,100
tag and look for segmentation category

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,740
spender bags meaning show them this

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,170
headline if they're this kind of person

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:21,440
and don't show them this headline if

00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:23,750
they're not imagine you start being able

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,650
to make changes to your site based on

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,780
the tags that are

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:32,660
coming from your system does that make

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:34,400
sense okay so with the rest of our time

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,890
and we're doing pretty good on time I

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,610
want to introduce you to six things you

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:42,920
can do with those six segments that we

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:47,690
had before okay six things you can do

00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:51,380
with your store so the first I told you

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,510
about going to j.crew and when I went

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,860
into j.crew and I browsed the men's

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,000
section and I came back to the homepage

00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,090
nothing had changed

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,920
this is Urban Outfitters and Urban

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,020
Outfitters looks really really different

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,390
now right when I got to Urban Outfitters

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,960
it was all women be keep there was a

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,570
bikini

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,120
there was towels that were sandals there

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,550
were a lot there was a sundress right

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,920
the bunch of women in nice women

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,990
clothing and accessories and then I

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,700
clicked men and I went to look at a

00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,280
t-shirt sweatshirt and a pair of shoes

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,670
three clicks then I came back to the

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:31,040
homepage and look what happened pants

00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:32,900
shoes jackets pictures of all men they

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,400
looked at the click stream and they went

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,170
this guy's interested in male clothes

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,420
let's make sure when he comes back to

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,540
this homepage he sees male clothes okay

00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,300
so after browsing for three clicks right

00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,740
homepage is transformed and you go yes

00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,660
now I'm feeling more comfortable I feel

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,660
like this is for me I'm feeling at home

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,670
I'm likely to buy here because they're

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,480
showing me this stuff I like so you go

00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:59,230
okay how how do you do that right well

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,710
there is a product called right message

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:06,410
all right and right message lets you

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:09,170
change things based on the tags that you

00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:11,090
have in your crm but also tags you give

00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,490
them just because you've put them in

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,460
based on clickstream so for example I

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:19,040
created on a sample site I created these

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,890
categories noise-canceling Bluetooth in

00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,590
the air on air and over here why it's

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,750
about headphones and I love headphones

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,720
in fact I love them enough that my wife

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,160
says I have a problem with headphones

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,280
well I created this sample site of

00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,929
headphones and then I said hey I want an

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:40,840
auto segment and for noise canceling

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,460
if you land on this page product

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,450
category headphones noise-cancelling

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:51,039
headphones right or if you came from a

00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:54,999
custom URL that had ref equals noise

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:59,320
canceling or if your path in your

00:26:54,999 --> 00:27:04,779
browsing contains that category right

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:09,039
and you visited at least once tagged you

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,929
as noise canceling right I don't even

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,519
have to know you I don't have to know

00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,039
your name I don't have to have your

00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,049
email address I just have to know either

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,809
you came in through so imagine that I

00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:21,999
wrote you an email and my system sent

00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:23,440
you an email and in that email I put the

00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:25,269
link that said ref equals noise

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,519
canceling I just I put it on appended it

00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,960
to the URL because I was writing about

00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:30,340
noise canceling headphones in this email

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,210
so when you click the link that says

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,340
come to write cell die oh right you

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,889
click the link but I'm carrying the ref

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,269
and I then automatically tag you as

00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:42,340
someone who's interested in noise

00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:43,509
canceling but imagine you were just

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,460
browsing and you went from the homepage

00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:46,600
in to noise canceling you spent some

00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,850
time then you came back out to the

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,710
homepage I can change it based on the

00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,909
fact that I've now tagged you right does

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,200
that make sense you see on Oh timeout

00:27:51,909 --> 00:28:00,399
okay so here's what here's how it works

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,259
when you get to this fake site at this

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,869
point is called right cell de IO when

00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:07,269
you get to this fake site and you have

00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:08,740
never been there before you get at a

00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,899
glance as all the best headphones

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,299
there's a woman she's got headphones on

00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:16,210
and up here in the NAB it has all

00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:19,539
headphones and it has Bluetooth and

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,860
noise canceling and in Iran ear and over

00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,509
the year right those are the those are

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,840
the navs

00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:28,570
but if you browse the noise canceling or

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,889
the Bluetooth section and in fact

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,809
because I don't care that much about

00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:33,909
Bluetooth you actually have to browse

00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:35,889
the Bluetooth three times but if you

00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:39,539
browse the noise canceling first or just

00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:43,360
once when you come back to the homepage

00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:45,850
totally different hero image right I

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,230
just said change the back just me now it

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,140
doesn't know you don't and notice it

00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,940
doesn't say hi Chris

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,680
I've been watching you I know you like

00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,130
noise-canceling headphones here's the

00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,560
best one for you that's creepy

00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:03,310
right that's personalization gone wrong

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:06,310
nobody wants that right this just

00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:12,420
changes the title and the background

00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:12,420
image and so you go okay that's cool

00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:20,620
what about if you are a big spender or

00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:22,720
VIP shouldn't I just make sure that my

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,000
products or the ones I really want you

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,460
to spend sort to the top it's really

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,650
easy slash question mark order by equals

00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,950
price descending meaning put your most

00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:36,430
expensive products at the top that's

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:38,560
what's going on right up there right in

00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:41,140
the URL it's just adds that little piece

00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,310
right you can easily do that you can

00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,140
even do that when you're writing an

00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,090
email to someone when you're sending

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,280
them a link you just go hey I'm sending

00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,130
email to all my big spenders just wanna

00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,020
let you know we got one of the new

00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:55,840
singer sewing machines in but when they

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,480
go to the page to check it out the most

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,160
expensive ones are at the top because a

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,450
big spender doesn't want to start by

00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,860
looking at your cheap ones or have

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,420
random orders and start clicking next

00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,540
the next next I just bring it right to

00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:10,870
the top that makes sense and it's not

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:13,870
hard it's just a little string right

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,430
what about light pressure light pressure

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,890
if you have researchers you know those

00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:21,190
people that spend a large amount of time

00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,870
and very few checkouts right you tag

00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,270
them as a researcher then you go I need

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,980
to give them just a little bit of push

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,690
so what happens right I'm looking at

00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,590
this property in New York right it's the

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,820
Midtown Hilton and it says hey 74

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,280
percent of the rooms are booked and

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,530
rooms are going fast and then it says 60

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:45,670
people are viewing the property right

00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:49,450
now huh yeah I better but notice it's

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:50,770
it's light pressure right it's not fake

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,660
pressure they're not telling me

00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,790
by now or you'll never get a room again

00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,360
right they're not being crazy they're

00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:03,640
just saying heads up right we're already

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,800
oh yeah we're already at 3/4 full and by

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,880
the way

00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:12,130
sixty people are looking right now right

00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,040
I don't know if there are really 60

00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:19,030
people I don't know if there's only one

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:21,040
me but it makes you know just a nice

00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,900
little added pressure and you might do

00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,370
that on your store but only for

00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,140
researchers to help them for other

00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:28,090
people that are known you know like if

00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,320
you know this guy's gonna buy why would

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,700
you go in and add more pressure you're

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,170
like no it's all good right it's low

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,760
pressure environment but for a

00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,760
researcher you go let me add a little

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:55,570
yep

00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:57,540
just purchased so it depends on how they

00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,410
do it there are some systems that do it

00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,690
realistically meaning they're pulling

00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,850
from the orders and so those will pop up

00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,530
every now and then like oh some from

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,150
Newport Beach just purchased Oh someone

00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,410
from Valencia just purchased right like

00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:11,020
there's some of those and then there are

00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,400
others that are more like who look and

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,750
look and look and you're like there's

00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,660
not that many people on the planet I'm

00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,980
sorry it's fake right that over kills it

00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,560
so you just wanna you wanna make sure

00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,660
you do it right another thing you can do

00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:26,170
for coupon lovers is you can use a

00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,550
product like ahoy right at use ahoy to

00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,110
basically give them a coupon when they

00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:32,350
put something special in their cart

00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:34,180
right so you say oh look I don't know

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,040
who these people are but if someone puts

00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,740
one of these more expensive products in

00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,590
cart I'm happy to pop up a thing that

00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,150
says hey you can also look at the

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,560
cookies and say they've never visited

00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:47,290
here before right so you could say hey

00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,940
your first time visitor right love to

00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,110
give you five percent coupon here and

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,400
that would just help them go from

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,980
putting in the cart to putting them to

00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,020
checkout right use the Hawaii has all

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,450
sorts conditions for WooCommerce which

00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,980
is awesome you can also do exit intent

00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:04,060
when they're leaving be like hey before

00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,840
you go here's a deal all right and then

00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,220
cart abandoners

00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,860
right we talked about cart abandonment

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,480
we use a product called guilt Jill lets

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,970
you do all sorts of fun things in this

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,340
particular case I set it up where I say

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,320
hey after they walk away this is my

00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,450
other sample site called finest head

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,799
phones and it finest headphones if you

00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,029
put some in your cart and leave within

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,320
two hours you'll get the first email

00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:24,580
then 24 hours later you get another

00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,039
email then three days later you get

00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,899
another email and then seven days the

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,159
magic number seven if you can't get them

00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,700
back after seven they're never coming

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,159
back

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,539
so I sent four emails between the time

00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:36,580
you put in your cart into the seven days

00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:37,899
out and those emails will sound

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,899
different and work different right you

00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:42,070
can see the titles here like hey this is

00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,330
just from us that's fine as headphones

00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,750
the next one Chris did you forget

00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,490
something

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,889
hey we're still holding the cart for you

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,720
and then hurry your carts gonna expire

00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:52,110
soon do you know what people do now with

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,730
their cart they use it as a to-do list

00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,779
like it's late at night you're putting

00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,190
something in your card now you shouldn't

00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,500
shop by guys shot by 2:00 in the morning

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,299
I shop and I don't even remember that I

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,039
bought it the next day right that's not

00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:04,330
good what you want to do it some people

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,919
do is they put it in the cart and

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,360
they're like I'll come back later and

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,889
buy it but then they forget that they

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,329
did it and you're going where was that

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:12,909
site where I found that cool thing and I

00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:13,899
don't know I don't remember so you sent

00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:17,079
me an email saying hey we're about to

00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:18,339
empty your cart no no harm no foul no

00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:20,919
pressure we're just gonna empty it out

00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:22,240
and they go no not yet let me click the

00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:26,649
link and go buy it anyway thank you very

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:30,040
much all right and then the last one is

00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:31,869
repeat buyers right repeat buyers this

00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,369
is a particular integration I did with a

00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,530
product called convertkit which does

00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:37,839
emails and has tags and what I wanted to

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,629
do was say hey the first time you buy

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,760
something we're gonna look at a custom

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:45,159
field and the custom field is called

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,450
total purchases and so when you come in

00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,389
for the first time ever and you make a

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,889
purchase I'm gonna take total purchases

00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,020
and I'm gonna see this blank I'm gonna

00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:54,700
make it from zero to one and then after

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,169
one I'm gonna make it two and then after

00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,609
two I'm gonna make it three and so you

00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:59,290
create this little logic that moves it

00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:02,410
down after three I'm going to add

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:04,089
another tag called repeat buyer and now

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,670
that customer has repeat buyer on it so

00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:09,160
now what do I do

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,839
exclusive to only you my best customers

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,010
I want to tell you about a special deal

00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:14,109
to a special price to a special location

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,490
here's a link go now it's only be there

00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:17,260
24 hours but it's only for you please

00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,000
don't tell anyone else this is exclusive

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,470
to just you right but I can send it to

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,680
my repeat buyers who are likely to buy

00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,680
make sense

00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,050
so basically your mom was wrong you

00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,550
shouldn't treat everybody the same

00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,350
my name is Chris dama I work at a

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,120
company called liquid web you can find

00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:42,990
me at Twitter at Chris summer

00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:47,970
thank you very much and I think we now

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:49,230
have ten minutes for Q&A anyone have any

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,200
questions and if not you just go early

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,700
right because I think is it lunch next I

00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:04,590
think I'm gonna get you out early for

00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:06,210
lunch yeah did you just say a but after

00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,520
that you're like I just want to let you

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,600
know best presentation ever but when you

00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:20,910
say but it's like it nullifies

00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:22,260
everything I just said so the question

00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:28,350
is how many times are I've been confused

00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:32,610
for fluffy and only once he and I were

00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:34,920
both in Hawaii the same week I was about

00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,840
a hundred pounds heavier I did have a

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,400
very short haircut at the time no hat I

00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,000
was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and jean

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,920
shorts

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,030
only because my wife had bought him for

00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,680
Christmas and I was like I should wear

00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,150
them at least once so I was wearing the

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,490
jean shorts flip-flops the Hawaiian

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,810
shirt very short haircut and was heavier

00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,630
and I walked through the airport and

00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,850
everybody stopped and they're like is it

00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,010
is it is it and so someone walks up he

00:36:53,850 --> 00:37:00,570
goes is it you and I go yes

00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:02,240
it is I and then and then he's like oh

00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,410
my god can I get your autograph I'm like

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,130
to be clear it's gonna say Chris lemon

00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:11,150
not fluffy and he was like

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:21,170
so yeah yeah once any other questions

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:21,739
yes so the question was that like what

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,059
do we have

00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,259
tutorial videos to help learn more

00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:26,509
here's a beautiful thing you don't have

00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:29,200
to buy anything from the web I really do

00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:31,609
like a monthly podcast or a monthly

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,960
webinar on e-commerce stuff that you can

00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:34,819
go learn and get access to all those for

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,979
free and then I have a podcast on

00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:38,630
e-commerce where we rolled out the first

00:37:36,979 --> 00:37:40,640
10 episodes called store builders and

00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,930
that's also all free so you don't have

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,009
to become a liquid customer to get

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:49,220
access to good information the podcast

00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:51,079
is still at our site the videos are on

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,660
our site but I think the videos are on

00:37:51,079 --> 00:38:00,200
YouTube so you can look at the group for

00:37:53,660 --> 00:38:01,640
that yep any other questions is that it

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,970
for a cell phone that's a great question

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,920
that is a liquid web device that you

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:10,160
attach to the back of the cell phone and

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,039
it functions as both a stand to have

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,690
your phone held up and a ring you can

00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,400
put your finger in it and hold it up it

00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,210
is the shape of the teardrop which is

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,140
our logo so it's all fancy all at once

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:27,170
yeah that was cool yeah

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:29,529
anyone have any e-commerce question I'm

00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,529
sorry way

00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:36,810
absolutely you can use any of these

00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,950
tricks anywhere right so you have to you

00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,600
have to get tools and you have to know

00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,420
what you're doing to do it right but the

00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,010
ability to tag someone as a researcher

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,940
right someone who spends a lot of time

00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:50,700
and doesn't actually close in the Airbnb

00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,290
world you might say okay how often do

00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,520
they come back to this property and they

00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,510
don't you know they keep looking but

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,010
they don't close they keep looking in

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,200
the home close and then you say okay the

00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,480
third time they visit I need to drop a

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,310
cookie and and then the third time they

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,430
visit let's add a little more pressure

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:07,440
right you would use something like write

00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,820
message because write message would

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,590
allow you to change the text on the

00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,530
screen without using the Airbnb system

00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:23,250
so that's how you'd pull that off

00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:24,740
yeah okay so the question is how can

00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,870
this help with the subscription business

00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:30,870
so almost everything here is going to

00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,580
count the only difference is more often

00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,900
than not in the subscription world the

00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,340
metrics you're looking for aren't

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,380
purchase related like we did here

00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,460
because the purchase is auto purchase so

00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,410
then you're going to change some of

00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,450
these metrics not to be the most active

00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,220
purchaser but maybe the most active

00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:47,010
visitor so you might look at who's

00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:49,590
logging in I built a lot of SAS products

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,510
and I would always look at how long does

00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:54,510
it take for someone to come back and

00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,690
login five times right and so if they

00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,220
log in five times in three days awesome

00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,380
if they log in five times in three

00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,610
months not so awesome gonna tag them

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:10,230
differently and react to them

00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:11,460
differently does that make sense yeah so

00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,440
the question is how do we apply these

00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,810
techniques to guest checkouts well some

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,010
several of those techniques were not

00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:19,730
predicated on me having to have you in

00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,770
my CRM right so clickstream analysis

00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:25,320
length of time on the site those things

00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,480
you can do without having them be logged

00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,100
in and be guests but there's some that

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,330
are harder right so if I if you spent a

00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,700
certain number of minutes on the site

00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:34,050
and visits certain number of visits on

00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,100
the page I might add a little light

00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,230
pressure and I could do that with the

00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,390
right message based on your quick stream

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,400
I might change what is visible or what

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:45,390
shows up or even change the text based

00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,010
on where you came from right the URL

00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,960
I could potentially change some things

00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:51,210
so for example if you came from Men's

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,920
Health magazine I might change the

00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,290
homepage even before the first time you

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,960
visit to make it more male centric and

00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:59,460
if you came from women's

00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,780
something-or-other right I might adjust

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,820
it that way right so some of those

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,880
things you can still do anonymously so

00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,880
the referring URL time on site path

00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:14,180
visits or all things I would use to help

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,619
shape that expert experience Yeah right

00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,420
message is a SAS service it is not a

00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,280
plugin it can be used on any technology

00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,900
so you can use it on a Shopify store or

00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:34,050
WooCommerce store or your regular

00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:36,330
website yeah yeah thank you so the

00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:38,990
question is the technology looks amazing

00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:42,000
how hard is it to use the convertkit

00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,380
plug-in that sends data into your

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,349
ecommerce store based on what they

00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,720
bought or whatever is super super simple

00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:50,520
the right message on the other side

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,410
which is analyzing stuff and creating

00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,589
campaigns I'm at me that takes a little

00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:59,310
more work but it's possible to do and in

00:41:55,589 --> 00:42:00,690
fact they have people that when you when

00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,920
you sign up right they'll have some

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,599
people who can help you through some of

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,080
that right so there's a little bit of

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,080
onboarding that that helps with that

00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,080
yeah

00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:31,880
right so the question is he uses

00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:33,709
WooCommerce he uses authorized.net as a

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,930
payment gateway do I have any experience

00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:37,069
with that so I built the first one of

00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:41,209
the first e-commerce stores

00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:42,999
to hit authorize.net in 1996 I've been

00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:46,999
using them ever since

00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:48,469
yes you have to purchase a payment

00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:50,930
gateway it's not free with WooCommerce

00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:52,939
if you purchase it that will make you

00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,799
that'll help you connect the real trick

00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:57,289
with authorize.net is not the connection

00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:59,719
the real trick is that there are two or

00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:01,910
three different versions of authorize on

00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:03,859
the inside of authorized on that meaning

00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:06,170
you can connect and be like oh it works

00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:07,969
but later you go to do something right

00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:11,660
and it doesn't happen and you go why not

00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:13,069
and they go oh you're using the one that

00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,619
doesn't have CI m which is to come from

00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:16,999
a customer information manager or you

00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:18,229
say no you get on phone call

00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:20,150
I want the customer information manager

00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:21,410
CI m and they go yo you got it and then

00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,359
you go do something else and it doesn't

00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,339
work and then you're like why you call

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:29,150
them they oh you have Sam one not cm -

00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:30,589
yeah Wow how do how do I call you and

00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,029
just tell you I want it all to work and

00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:33,679
then you're never a jerk to me what do I

00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:36,140
have to say to make that happen so

00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:39,589
that's a hard part but if you purchase

00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,089
the the Gateway on WooCommerce com

00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:42,289
they have extensions and if you

00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:44,569
purchased that authorized on that

00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:46,759
gateway there and you call authorized on

00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:48,199
it on the phone and tell them I'm gonna

00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:49,489
be doing subscriptions or I'm gonna be

00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:51,349
doing this I'm gonna be doing that I

00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:51,949
need your CI m and I need the best one

00:43:51,349 --> 00:44:00,160
that does this

00:43:51,949 --> 00:44:02,359
they will set you up well it's the

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,519
authorized.net extension that you can

00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:07,249
buy from WooCommerce comm is the one I

00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,660
recommend I there are a lot of other

00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:09,949
sites that sell a lot of other stuff a

00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,099
lot cheaper and they're not necessarily

00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:12,099
the same

00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,730
all right I think that's it thank you

00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:20,440
guys so much have a great day have a

00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,440
