00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:27,100
thank you very much so today let me give

00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,950
you a little bit more about me so I have

00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,880
been working at WordPress for the past

00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:36,460
10 years have about 7,500 hours in the

00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,120
back gate over to us and I've been

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:46,350
working with MailChimp not exclusively

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:52,300
but mostly 98% of the time for the past

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:55,300
nine years so here's what you're gonna

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,989
get today you're gonna learn what's at

00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,079
your convenience which format to use for

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:05,920
your picking there's more than one how

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,750
long your campaign should be how many

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,830
emails you're gonna want to put into

00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:16,630
your campaign and then how often you

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:21,700
should send your emails so do kidneys

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:24,630
are not exclusively ecommerce and it

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,630
can't be ecommerce

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,000
so it's no surprise probably everyone in

00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:46,910
this world of the hardest thing about

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,570
sounds is getting no means for

00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:55,970
every industry out there the hardest

00:01:50,570 --> 00:02:02,270
thing is to believe but who knows what a

00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:06,020
jerk campaign is oh yeah good all right

00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:09,860
so it's a series of automated email sent

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,320
over a period of time every subscriber

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,510
starts an email number one no matter

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,610
when they subscribe so they subscriber

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,290
jet somebody subscribes in January they

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,300
get email number one and somebody

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,890
subscribes in August they get email

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,950
number one and then they go through to

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:28,610
the series and the object of the Gherkin

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:31,459
pain is to keep your name in front of

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,060
the readers for that name and brand

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,060
recognition

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:45,320
so drip campaigns are really good to

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:48,850
educate customers about your products or

00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,370
industry or educate potential customers

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:56,090
about your product or industry to

00:02:52,370 --> 00:03:00,320
confirm appointments or reservations to

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:05,330
promote your latest product to onboard

00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,730
new clients and to deliver courses so

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,800
you've probably gotten at your campaign

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,080
in the past and I've never even thought

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,280
about it you may have not even thought

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,180
it was an automated campaign if you go

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:25,100
to the dentist and the dentist sends you

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:30,100
an email reminder or a text reminder of

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,100
your appointment that's Jim candy

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,160
and here's the real important part about

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,380
your campaigns is that when somebody

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,380
comes to your website they're not

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,770
necessarily ready to buy they may be

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,400
ready to be educated about the product

00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:55,700
your industry what you're selling what

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,850
you're doing how to use your services

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,810
but they're not necessarily ready to buy

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:06,590
and there's an old urban legend that it

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:31,370
takes seven touches or something in the

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:34,340
body so it doesn't necessarily take

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:38,660
seven you know it depends on that person

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:41,150
but usually people need to to have some

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,180
kind of introduction to your products it

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:47,950
really is all about how much you know

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:54,380
your customers pain points and then how

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:59,450
you can communicate your benefits and

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,880
your the way you solved or will solve

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,620
their pain points that's what it's about

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,479
and that's what a good drip campaign

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:12,430
does you know their pain point and you

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,430
tell them how you're gonna solve it

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,710
so there's two kinds of their campaigns

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,569
when it's a jerk campaign and one's a

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:27,330
nurturer campaign you might think that

00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:33,349
these are the same but they are not real

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:35,729
tiny subtle difference a drip campaign

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:39,180
it's something that you send over time

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:42,330
and you just send it and people receive

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,849
it a nurture campaign is something that

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:53,310
you send over time and it's based on

00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:57,680
actions that your readers take or

00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:00,210
behaviors that your readers have each

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,789
subscriber gets even specifically

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,490
created to walk them through the sales

00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:07,860
process your campaign may not walk them

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,039
through a sales process but are nurture

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:15,330
campaign is specifically to walk them

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:19,080
through the sales process and the object

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,849
or nurture campaign is by the time they

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,589
get to the energy campaign or by the

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:25,560
time they get to the end of the energy

00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:28,979
campaign they're buying or they've

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:32,550
already purchased so this is how you

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:35,550
know how many emails to send and this is

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:43,319
how you know how long to make your

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:46,370
nurtured so 96% of visitors we know

00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,649
we're growing sorry

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:53,580
so nurture kid needs good rates nurture

00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:54,300
campaigns are abandoned carts membership

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,580
renewals

00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,740
that's animate Desa awesome nurture

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:04,229
campaign reminders to use a software or

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,099
reminders to use the service or

00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:09,569
reminders to use a course read each four

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,610
customers that aren't opening or

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:14,639
clicking on emails with the intention to

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:18,499
unsubscribe it maybe and people when I

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,499
say and subscribe people usually go

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,999
ya know

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,159
Plus this timing is super good I

00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:29,199
subscribe somebody every day for less

00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:30,999
it's a good thing because then you don't

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,699
have deadweight on your list then you

00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:37,659
have a list that's vibrant and is

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:39,879
engaged and honestly if you're using an

00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:43,629
email service provider like MailChimp or

00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:47,620
Constant Contact or active campaign they

00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:52,139
look at how many emails are open and so

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:56,520
does Google and they deliver your emails

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:59,289
based on the engagement one in your list

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,080
so if your list is really engaged it's

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,539
just like a website if you have a

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,099
website as lots of people are coming to

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,430
you and they're really engaged with your

00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,659
website you're gonna get pushed up in

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,180
the search

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:16,060
same thing for emails if you have an

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,310
email list that has engagement that

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,949
people are opening their clicking on

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,110
your you're going to get delivered just

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:27,089
a little bit easier don't ask me how

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,089
they know that they just know it

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:40,419
so here's the beauty of nurture

00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:45,640
campaigns and your campaigns it's the

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:49,839
ability to segment so the ability to

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:53,050
segment emails lists and individualize

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,959
email campaigns that messaging our email

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:59,680
campaigns those are the two most

00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:03,880
effective personalization tactics that

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:07,860
there are and this was a 2016 survey

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:12,310
that people that ascend - she took a lot

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:15,850
personal experience personalization is

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,660
all is all about it and it's not just

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,570
like putting in hi Amy that's not

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,360
necessarily personalization

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,980
it is but it's not personalization is

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,259
when somebody comes to your shop

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,579
shopping cart or with somebody comes

00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,279
your site put something in the shopping

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:33,959
cart and then they abandon and then you

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,600
send them emails about the specific

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,089
things that were in their shopping cart

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,380
or somebody purchases something from you

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:47,130
and you send them emails about something

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,690
that's a complementary item to what they

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:54,329
have you know maybe they bought the

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:57,660
MacBook Pro but they need the USB sees

00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:07,110
all gold painting or just like this

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:08,670
morning so you send them it up self so

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,459
the thing about your kid needs a nurture

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:17,069
campaigns is that they give people what

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:20,130
they want when they want it in the thing

00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:21,449
about your guess the meeting where you

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,940
create your first campaign your

00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:27,959
guesstimating but you'll be able to see

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,000
from your replies and from your opens

00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,250
and from your clicks and you'll be able

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,930
to narrow that down by doing a lot of

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:40,079
analytics in in your email service

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:44,880
provider to really know when you need to

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,069
put each thing send each email you know

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,440
you'll have the old custom a reply to an

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:51,709
email with a question and anything oh I

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,870
answered that question in two emails

00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:57,300
well then it's time you set out that

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:01,819
campaign you may want to shift it so

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:06,029
that question gets answered earlier use

00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:08,670
segmentation to make it useful this is

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:11,540
not a broadcast it's not the newsletter

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,550
that goes to everybody it needs to be

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,740
segmented and the more you segment but

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:23,399
the more you can segment the more you

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:24,959
can hit that person's pain point because

00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,019
of what they've clipped in your shiner

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,010
because if when they click in the email

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,070
the prior email

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:37,210
the better off you are segmentation is

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:39,010
all about seventies so personalized

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:43,660
emails with first names of product

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,350
preferences for better conversion so you

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:52,930
can put first names into the middle of

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:55,750
and email it's easy to do and it makes

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:59,440
it more it's people think that you're

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:06,160
writing specifically to them I have a

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:10,210
series of like probably 70 emails that

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:14,160
go out over my web depth process and

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:16,450
I've sprinkled first names literally

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,720
inside of there so people think it's

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:25,510
coming from me it's hilarious because I

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:28,510
get emails back oh and it's so funny

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,130
because I know it's all over at the

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:37,810
beginning I'm gonna send you automation

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:41,940
of all these emails so transactional

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,560
emails receive eight times of many opens

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,700
compared to regular marketing emails and

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,240
regular marketing emails are newsletters

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:55,750
transaction emails are the nurture

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,300
campaign and also if you have an

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,310
e-commerce store

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,550
here's your shipping information here's

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,940
your receipt and those are drip

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,940
campaigns

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:15,390
I met somebody purchase purchases from

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,770
you and you send them an email saying

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:26,750
thanks for your order

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:31,380
and that's a jerk campaign yes so

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:37,230
they're all under the umbrella of jerk

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:42,270
campaigns and really the the distinction

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,940
is that a merger campaign is based on an

00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,590
action that people took and you're

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,920
pushing them towards a sale

00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:53,250
that's why expect ran transactional

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,610
email is just a drip because they just

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,800
purchased so you're and you're gonna do

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,780
the same type of emails for everyone

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,860
everybody's gonna receive a seed receive

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:06,870
and a bacon and then you might send the

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,190
shipping information when it ships oh it

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,640
should today use your tracking number

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:23,900
and you also may send them

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:23,900
oh this journal so you might have

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,800
there's also other uses for

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,070
transactional but we're talking about

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,070
e-commerce

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,420
so we're going to walk through planning

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,430
a campaign and I would you have

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,860
opportunity to actually plan your

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,630
campaign year and have me answering your

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,280
questions so we're going to walk through

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,360
it first I'm going to show you something

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,860
and your brains probably gonna like

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,780
that's most of the time that's what I

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:18,660
hear it's so in your campaign this is

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,750
what you need to plan how many emails

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,640
will you sent will you send I'm assuming

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:28,110
that you already have your subject or

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:31,860
your topic okay what order are you gonna

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:36,200
send those emails what is the time frame

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:43,470
for those emails what are your triggers

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:44,690
and what will success look like so we're

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:49,280
going to go back to football the later

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:55,530
so here is a jerk campaign sequence

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:59,520
notice it is very it's very linear super

00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:03,330
linear right if it doesn't have any

00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,760
movement it's just straight so if you

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,580
were a hairdresser somebody books an

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,120
appointment then you're gonna send them

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,470
an email this is a transactional email

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,500
you're gonna send them an email that

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,170
says thanks for booking and the time and

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,200
the date of the appointment and the

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,900
address that they need to get to one

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,560
week prior you're gonna remember them oh

00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,170
hey you have a hair appointment because

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,170
I'm good for you and you're gonna send

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:37,530
them the same information the time to

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:40,530
date the address and a rescheduled link

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:44,460
in case something came up that's for you

00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:47,340
that's up for them because you can plan

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,910
your work look better in favor simple

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,520
instead of just not showing up one day

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:58,230
prior you're gonna send the same thing

00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:00,050
and the rescheduling because maybe you

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,600
can get somebody in there and

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,830
if they were simple but probably not as

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,350
they just don't show up

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:10,850
the day of appointment you're gonna send

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:15,730
the exact same thing right you want to

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:18,589
get the interface so they remember and

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,199
you may want to resend a rescheduling

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:24,290
here if you're a hairdresser you

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,790
probably it probably will work for you

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,309
if you're like a dentist or a doctor

00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,410
probably wouldn't work tats send over

00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:32,780
schedule link there unless you have a

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,270
residential link with a little remember

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:42,160
appointments reschedule 24 hours in

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:44,900
advance get charged yeah and then the

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,540
after they've completed their

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,630
appointment you're gonna send them a

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,030
thanks for coming and a link to book the

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,230
next appointment

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,750
just think you know if you're getting

00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,010
your hair cut you need another haircut

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,050
unless you're like Joe do you need

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:05,059
another haircut and six weeks right I

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:08,210
still need to shave every few days and

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:09,530
then if they don't in a couple weeks

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,000
if they don't sign up for that

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:16,040
appointment you send them a and thick

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,559
and a reminder that they need to make an

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:24,410
appointment so this is a simple drip

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:27,620
campaign superlinear and can you see it

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,330
answers all these questions how many

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:44,660
emails will you send or we have a

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:47,110
specific number if I mean in what order

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:54,020
we have a logical order for all of these

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:56,540
emails what's your time frame well we do

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,260
exactly we did it right after they made

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:03,500
the appointment and then one week prior

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:06,080
that was our time frame what are your

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
triggers well the first trigger was they

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,600
made the appointment

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,360
the second trigger was they fulfilled

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,510
the appointment what will success look

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,760
like success will look like number one

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:23,330
they came in for the haircut and number

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,330
two they scheduled another appointment

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:41,159
okay so watch out for your minds there's

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:43,289
a bunch of campaign oh all right so most

00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,500
people have a free often offer on their

00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:48,000
site not everybody good a lot of people

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,650
will have a free option offer on their

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,480
site or they may go free often offer on

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:55,140
their site so we're gonna start with

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,659
that you know free opt-in offer that

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,390
people can download for free can I say

00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:03,360
free a little bit so the first thing

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:06,890
we're going to go hello first so you're

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,710
gonna send them an email that says

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:13,020
here's your free download you also when

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,539
they fill out the form you also want to

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:19,049
have the thank you screen the pops up or

00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:23,309
send them to a thank you page that has a

00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:27,000
link for the free download so if they

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:29,400
download that then the next step is six

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,830
like to send them an explainer video and

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,620
this is not like you don't need to do

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,940
this but this is like the example I'm

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,240
not saying oh you have to make an

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:43,350
explainer video no just fill in your own

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,240
stuff here but this is a good example so

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,190
you if they did download then you send

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,860
them an explainer video that goes into

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:56,850
more depth then the free optin offer did

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,659
they open the explainer video no or yes

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:04,440
if they opened it the explainer video

00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:05,360
then you offer them a product demo or a

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,330
constant

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,380
service consultation and in that you

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:17,330
know you send a link to schedule a

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:21,020
consultation or the demo if no they

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:23,030
didn't open the explainer video well

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,500
then you send them an e-book to go in

00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,420
somewhere that doesn't support up

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,679
because maybe they don't like the video

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:37,580
format maybe they wanna read I've only

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:42,230
recently kind of been liking videos so I

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,730
usually read I want to read so you can

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,059
send them a debugger hose-end don't look

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:50,030
at that and then if they open the e-book

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:51,890
that goes into more depth then you come

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:56,360
back over here and offer them the

00:21:51,890 --> 00:22:00,200
product if they didn't open the e-book

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,940
that goes into more depth then we're

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,230
gonna take them off of the sequence

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,000
we're gonna take them out of the

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,990
sequence we're just gonna send them the

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,090
newsletter because they're not

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,290
interested and you shouldn't be wasting

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,510
your time on people that are not

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,429
interested at this time doesn't mean

00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,350
they won't be interested in the future

00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,650
just don't mean to waste your time on

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:21,380
people that weren't interested right now

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:26,750
so if they sign up for the free often

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:29,720
offer but they did not download you can

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,750
send them a video with a high-level

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:37,750
overview of the opt-in of the hopped in

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:40,370
content and it's another way to download

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:43,400
so you the object is to get them to

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:47,450
download here and it's did that was

00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:52,010
superb in it the explainer video this

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:56,720
one is super high level so if they

00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:00,590
opened the explainer video then you send

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,510
them this explainer video that goes into

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,600
more depth this one and this one are the

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,340
same so you're going to send them that

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,940
explainer video that goes into more

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,940
depth and now they're in this sequence

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:20,279
and they followed the sequence now if

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:24,720
the answer is now they did not open the

00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:25,440
video then you keep him out there so not

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,510
interested

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:34,529
probably somebody signed them up for

00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:36,360
that without them knowing it so this can

00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:37,740
be totally convoluted yes how would you

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,649
know what they open and open on you have

00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,950
to get their permission no uh usually

00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:46,230
there's links and you can have the links

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:50,880
the links tell you in the emails

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:54,120
there's the leaks while I use MailChimp

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,669
but all email service providers are

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,010
going to be the thing if you click a

00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:01,169
link it will tell you click the link and

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:13,980
you can make the trigger for the next

00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:16,919
email this in a send the click so you

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,799
have to specify what the trigger is so

00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,110
we tell checkpoints to do exactly if

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,600
you're using L tip or you know if using

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:40,799
drip or if you're using active campaign

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:43,169
or constant it's not so degrees on I use

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,500
MailChimp is because when we first

00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:48,480
started using mobile email MailChimp

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,149
converted every single one single one of

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,360
its templates so we'll be evil email and

00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:57,960
overnight boom like that close it

00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,309
contact took a year they were not

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,169
convinced that mobile what's the way to

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:02,460
go and that's part of the reason why

00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:03,240
these melted was because they're

00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,490
forward-thinking

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,649
they are always looking at how I make

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:12,519
things better for the people who are

00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:18,669
sending emails so they don't do that

00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:20,519
super pad so when you subscribe our

00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:23,799
purchase MailChimp I don't know the

00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,299
technology is there do they also share

00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:28,089
with you this information to make how do

00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:35,859
you learn how to use MailChimp once you

00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:40,089
come to me so the mail chick has tons

00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:45,450
and tons and tons of videos a lot of

00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:45,450
educational videos so they're super good

00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:55,209
but a lot of it is also written out in

00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:56,889
written form so so people can't some

00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:59,019
people can't have over it in form so

00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:01,629
then you can go YouTube there are five

00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:05,829
billion milchin how to do this on

00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:09,429
MailChimp on YouTube on one of them so

00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:11,799
you can do that or you can sign up for a

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:15,700
training I learned in an hour what it

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:17,289
takes people six months to learn I like

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,899
to mount you trainings on one of my for

00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:21,899
each other

00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:40,419
so at our is $99 right well look at my

00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:43,179
site as I'm not Amy hold up is so an

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:46,659
hour's 99 and I think an hour and a half

00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:51,039
is 169 and I run them just a little bit

00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:54,309
differently so the 99 is if you really

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,099
don't have any knowledge at all and I

00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:59,679
will walk through everything but I do

00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:02,489
the driving and you just watch and then

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:06,009
I said you're recording and you can

00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:08,109
watch the recording later on and you ask

00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:11,469
questions and you ask me okay I want to

00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:14,690
do XYZ and I will show you how to do XY

00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:19,090
and Z but the 169

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:23,780
is I'm like the driving instructor and

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:25,730
you are the driver student so I will

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,500
watch what you're doing on your screen

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,440
and I won't say you click this go here

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,340
do that I'm very kinesthetic if I don't

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:38,660
do it myself

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:42,530
they don't work so that ones I've no

00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:44,270
idea that one is for the kinesthetic

00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,780
people like me who have to do it

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,160
themselves so they know it's going on

00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:53,960
yeah I couldn't leave myself out of the

00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:58,430
next thing all right so let's do it

00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,920
you ready yeah question about the video

00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:03,350
that you would like send because I just

00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,000
I think that's a great idea if you are

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,100
like a restaurant your hairdressing we

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,960
have a business to like people confuse

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,300
like we're on the second floor like I

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,790
realize like that's a great so people

00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,580
ears are parking lot young guys where

00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:19,420
you go yeah a one-minute video I just go

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:22,360
ahead you can expect when you walk in

00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:25,070
this is what our our business looks like

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,100
everybody can put in video here's our

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,230
entrance look for this and other

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,390
services because we have some other

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,100
services and they never can get people

00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,830
to like I add them on my little

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,050
MailChimp thing cuz I use MailChimp but

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:42,950
no one ever looks at it but if I did a

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:44,660
little quick yeah I'm gonna caution you

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,450
down so you really only want one thing

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:53,210
on an email people have seconds yes

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:58,130
seconds to grab attention so and I make

00:28:53,210 --> 00:29:00,550
huge long emails for people I mean he's

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:05,120
the long emails from people for

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:08,140
associations and burn churches that have

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,390
tons and tons and tons of information

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,890
nobody gets to the bottom of those

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,230
nobody it's on your bones

00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,870
the first third and then they have

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:21,460
burnout and they don't want to read any

00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:24,890
more of high-school that sends out a

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,740
fine to scroll email every single week

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,929
and people are always complaining down

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,150
get the information yes you did you just

00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:33,620
as strong you know if people are used to

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,960
scrolling it's not like we're not used

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,570
to strongly we are mobile we are used to

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,000
strongly but the shorter the sweeter you

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,179
can make your email the better off you

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,620
are

00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:48,350
and sending out once a week sending out

00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:52,850
twice a week if it's pertinent your

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:55,730
audience if it's valuable if you're

00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:59,870
solving their pain points with your

00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:10,030
emails nothing wrong with that if you're

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:14,720
just chatting it up no five subjects

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:20,000
like the mail that that fit the mail is

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,130
not so people always want the social

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,530
media links at the bottom you know

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,559
Facebook Twitter you know connect with

00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:32,390
me on Facebook Twitter I swear only

00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:35,320
maybe 0.5% people ever click on that it

00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:38,450
is like there's no reason people want

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,220
the share on Facebook like they put

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,280
their article in there and they want a

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:49,100
button to share this article on Facebook

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:51,320
Zimmer clicks because it's like you're

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,020
trying to get to third base on the first

00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,270
date on that one

00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:00,260
you're asking to get married before

00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:06,980
you're even dating on that one so I yeah

00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:08,360
I try and tell you not even like for a

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,440
duration of time like they're just

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,540
starting up your campaign

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,920
in one subject but do you find that

00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:18,890
maybe after six months adding more

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:22,010
subjects it's going to be what your

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,530
audience is to them so and it depends on

00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,780
your topic there are topics like the

00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:28,760
associations associations can have one

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:34,520
or emails I suppose they'd have longer

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:40,250
emails but with a high school we ended

00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:41,750
up breaking out each topic baby play so

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,790
they have a short email that goes out

00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,650
that's talks about all the teams and

00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:49,130
what the teams are doing and then they

00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:51,590
have a lunch email that goes out I in

00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:55,700
study getting one email with all of that

00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:58,390
stuff now we get five and if they're not

00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:03,970
interested they don't have to read it

00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:07,040
but it but it has made it a lot easier

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,500
for parents to get the information that

00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:16,550
they need for their kids and it's been a

00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:18,470
rougher on the school because what are

00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,840
the ways that MailChimp doesn't this if

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,910
you unsubscribe you unsubscribe from

00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,910
your list so we had to do something

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:28,250
fancy maneuvering there and put and

00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,460
instead of an unsubscribe we had to put

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:35,780
an update button so they could click

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:41,750
which items they want you so that's

00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:51,650
where the planning comes in subway all

00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:53,330
right it's not needed it's a it's like

00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:58,090
an add-on that you put in that general

00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:00,560
the thing about Belgium is that it's

00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,300
it's the most used email service

00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,210
provider because they give you a free

00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,830
account up to 22,000 email addresses

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:12,740
right so the tons of people that use it

00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:16,190
so there's a lot of extensions add-ons

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,020
or MailChimp you can do basically

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,530
anything you want to with Belgium except

00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:24,110
hook it up to Shopify

00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:24,110
we're the melting and shopify needed

00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,790
pouch now you have to use a thing called

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:35,250
shop sink can you say that in more

00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:37,560
layman's term okay well the Commerce

00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,640
like I do I use MailChimp and then I'm

00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,230
going to be starting up I don't know who

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,540
knew Shopify or who commerce but I'm

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:46,130
wanting to know about into place

00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:49,830
so maybe this just happened last week

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:53,550
MailChimp and Shopify they used to have

00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:55,470
a native app that Shopify dimension talk

00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,930
to each other directly and it was an app

00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:01,980
built by now check okay so chocolate I

00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:04,170
wants to do some weird things with data

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,900
that MailChimp does not agree with and

00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:09,450
it's okay for Shopify to do that but

00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:14,780
it's not okay with mountains Terms of

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:18,929
Service for a third party to do that so

00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:21,780
MailChimp and Shopify broke up so they

00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,480
don't have a MailChimp native Shopify

00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,690
patch so now there's something called

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,210
shop sync which is a third party it's

00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:32,520
not now check if it's not Shopify it's a

00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:35,280
third-party patch between now chickens

00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,290
Shopify it works really well I haven't

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:43,350
heard anybody complain about it so

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:45,440
that's really good okay and PS MailChimp

00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:51,240
just bought their own e-commerce

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:53,399
platform called lemonade I can drop live

00:34:51,240 --> 00:35:03,900
in something lemonade I think I think

00:34:53,399 --> 00:35:05,970
it's lemon stand so there you go all

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,270
right so does anybody want to walk

00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:12,330
through this process with me okay who

00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:15,330
ever video all right I'm apology

00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:19,770
everyone what time is it

00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:23,400
you have about five minutes super slow

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:26,210
all right so you haven't let's go in to

00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,210
view all the way in the back

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:35,210
okay so good once again all right good

00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:38,540
that's one period is this processing

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:42,230
okay so plan a campaign on how many

00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:45,050
emails will you sin so basically if I'm

00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:48,320
just getting into Miller I guess it

00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:50,960
sounds no okay so that's that's a

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:55,099
different so we're looking at a specific

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:59,210
nurture sequence so we're not looking at

00:35:55,099 --> 00:36:02,599
over the life of the mountain we're

00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,070
looking at to sell this one item how

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,730
many emails are you going to send in

00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:11,240
that sequence so I'm gonna go to run

00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,859
some is good so I mean I would think it

00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,660
would be however many gets you to that

00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:16,760
point your example it looked like more

00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,070
than seven for them so it doesn't

00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,349
necessarily need that okay so you have

00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:25,369
to look at how long your sales cycle is

00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:27,800
a sales cycle for a hairdresser is much

00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:31,640
shorter than a sales cycle for a real

00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,560
estate sales agent ex-pro preferred

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,820
product or service yes

00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,290
and it's always going to be different

00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,849
for product or service we have more

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:42,109
together right how about real estate

00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:43,609
agent that we did essentially at your

00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:48,170
campaign it's on her nurture campaign

00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:50,720
but we did two drip free drips one drip

00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,970
goes to everybody who is going to

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,330
purchase winter because everybody who

00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:58,550
wants to sell and one drip goes everyone

00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:03,310
so the first trip that goes to people

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:07,040
that want to sell it's over one year and

00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:10,040
he's been a broker for like a hundred

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,619
thousand years so he knows exactly what

00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,830
everybody needs to answer and the type

00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:19,730
of thing he did answer so he does what

00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:23,619
is um what to look for it in the house

00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:28,580
what to expect when he get an inspection

00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:31,880
what is title but his escrow how do you

00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:34,520
get a lender you know what to look for

00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:39,020
to get the right lender so he sends that

00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:40,240
kind of email over a whole year and he

00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,500
doesn't on the

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,349
that was the summer side right he

00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,230
doesn't on the buyers side also okay

00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:49,390
this is what you can expect when you're

00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:51,160
buying house learn and here's what you

00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,540
can expect when selling that house he

00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,450
goes basically the same thing

00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,300
it's he goes through inspection he goes

00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:01,920
through escrow he goes through title he

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:04,750
goes through for seller he goes through

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,240
staging he goes through curb appearance

00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:11,349
like he does everything that a seller

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,450
needs to know to sell their house that's

00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:15,430
what he goes through and this campaign

00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:19,119
goes over a year and then his other trip

00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:21,550
is a holiday part so every month except

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:29,710
for yeah everyone except for August he

00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:39,069
said oh there's no fungus

00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:42,250
we'll make one up so his holiday card is

00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:44,079
just an image which you have to watch

00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,609
out for images inside everybody turns on

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:51,270
images so make sure you use your alt

00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:54,609
text tanks but his buyer is seller

00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:57,160
they're like five Scrolls but these

00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:59,040
given read from top to bottom because

00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:12,640
he's addressing their pain points

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:14,290
specifically and so when they sign up on

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,299
my landing page to get this free

00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,980
download I have then they get a sequence

00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:20,349
of three emails so the first emails I

00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,329
can welcome email to my site and it just

00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:24,940
tells them a little bit about why I did

00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:27,460
this and then the next day they get

00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:30,069
email looks like the top five posts that

00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:33,339
might be helpful to them and that's

00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:35,230
because my main success goal for this

00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:36,730
was to get more traffic and then the

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,680
third email is just like if you have any

00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:45,700
questions you notice how to reach me and

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:48,760
so far the opening is like 75% oh that's

00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:52,510
good so are you selling anything from

00:39:48,760 --> 00:40:02,230
this no I just find that how to monetize

00:39:52,510 --> 00:40:03,609
yeah that's nice very nice okay and

00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:07,180
what's your click-through rate on the

00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:12,089
second one that's really high I can't

00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,089
remember though it's double digits I

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,420
have no idea like I wouldn't know that

00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:17,980
that was good I am about to look online

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:25,660
and see what the heck I'm getting cuz I

00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:27,760
don't even know if 75% is good just like

00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,390
base level yes so deep represent is

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,790
awesome

00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:34,630
okay and it depends it depends on your

00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:37,270
industry okay so for retail the industry

00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,309
open rate is like seven percent because

00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:41,950
people get piranhas with the retails you

00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:46,359
don't have to be like defeated right so

00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:50,109
so one thing you can Google industry

00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:54,730
email open rate for your industry anyone

00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:57,280
would look at that and so you don't get

00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,710
defeated by not having a 50 percent open

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,809
rate because people would get defeated

00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:04,260
by having a 50 percent open rate I just

00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:04,260
want to slap

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,630
no tell you Milton

00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,580
what the industry standard is yeah it

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,750
will if you're using Belgians I'm trying

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,360
not to make it Malchus

00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:18,780
so as an example I work at a college

00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:22,560
their fundraising office has an open

00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:25,050
rate of about 17 to 25 percent and

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,900
that's asking for money yeah and no one

00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:30,540
wants to give money away so if you're if

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,770
you're anywhere around that or higher I

00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,530
would say that's pretty good

00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,390
imagine if one in four people opened

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,520
your email that's that's that's actually

00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,710
pretty substantial yeah and you can

00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:45,240
always send out your email against the

00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:45,840
people who do not open just don't get

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:55,110
spammy

00:41:45,840 --> 00:42:00,030
yeah that's true they didn't notice so

00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:04,470
automated email messages average a 70

00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:07,320
point five percent higher open rates and

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:10,320
a 152 percent

00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,450
I have put the rates then business as

00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,230
usual marketing and that business as

00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:19,830
usual ours like the newsletters you use

00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:22,760
on there's always something Amy we're

00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,760
going after right buttons

00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:30,510
