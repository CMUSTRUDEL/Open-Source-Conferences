	00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,490
I've been working with wordpress since

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,990
20 and 2007 and I'm self-taught so I'm

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,170
the kind of person who didn't even know

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,730
what a URL or an FTP was when I first

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,280
started out and I experimented and it's

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,340
an all still bit surreal that I worked

00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,880
for automatic now and I help other

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,369
people with their stores so never stop

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,110
learning that's all I'll say

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:39,150
I started in support so if you've ever

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,720
filed a ticket with WooCommerce I

00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:46,320
probably might have waited on you but

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:51,960
today I lead the charge for all of our

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,000
documentation and it is I love it and I

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,520
hope that it's been useful to you and if

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,649
not you can tell me hey you can tell me

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,600
about it afterwards and I will take your

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,630
feedback and I will improve what we have

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,600
so the digital nomad part is was

00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,729
experimental as well I started out

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,290
thinking that I would only do it for a

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:16,049
year and I've been doing it now for

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:18,510
three and a half years what that means

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,290
to me is that I have no home base I am

00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,840
homeless everything that I own fits in

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,240
this carry-on and one suitcase in the

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,240
car right now I move from

00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,090
driven by things like this that I do for

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,640
the community or I speak and the reason

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,220
I'm here is what Joe mentioned in the

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,640
opening remarks Joe was sitting at a

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,200
table by himself at WordCamp us and I

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,210
thought I'm gonna go talk to him

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,890
and we had got in the conversation he

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,420
was excited to learn that I work for

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,009
WooCommerce and he's like oh so you're

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,530
gonna bring us all the swag and you're

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,420
gonna speak and and you're gonna and and

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,520
his you know this word camp hadn't even

00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,930
been announced yet and I was like calm

00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,490
down there Joe know that that doesn't

00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,280
mean I can do that I don't work for

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,530
events I I would just work for you know

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,480
the WooCommerce team you're gonna have

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,170
to apply through all the normal channels

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,690
and then do a call for speakers and

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,910
anything he's like oh you know I'm yeah

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,730
and I felt sort of bad because I was

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:28,160
like oh no I've like crashed his dreams

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:30,709
here and then I submitted through I when

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,120
I found out that I was going to my team

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:38,390
meetup is in Philadelphia next week and

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,549
I'm driving toward my meet up at this

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,430
moment and this in my Mustang which is

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:44,900
really fun for for me and I thought no

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,690
one well you know what it kind of

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:53,260
corresponds to California so I'm gonna

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:55,579
I'm gonna I'm gonna stop in and I

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,390
applied to speak just like everybody

00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:03,200
else and within about five minutes

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,390
Joe pings me he's like is that really

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,329
you or is that somebody pretending to be

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,430
you because he said you couldn't go and

00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:12,590
I told him it was really me and I told

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,570
him he should feel free to reject me if

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:20,989
he wants to take revenge on me or if the

00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:23,390
talk doesn't fit so but he was and so

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,209
now here I am and I also want to tell

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,920
you why I'm I'm speaking because I think

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,269
it's really important to acknowledge

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:36,200
this I'm definitely afraid of speaking

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:40,230
in front of other people but I'm into

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:44,099
tech conferences where it's been all men

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,409
and I wanted to see women and people of

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,670
color represented and so instead of

00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,250
complaining about it

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,909
I decided to get on stage myself and so

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,909
now Here I am

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,610
and I'm hoping that other people will

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,970
see me and they will dare themselves to

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,140
get on stage too because it has been the

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,640
most frightening but also life-changing

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,650
thing that I've done in the last year's

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,250
and I've met so me as so many amazing

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,590
people because of it so please give it a

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,510
try if you I'm sure all of you in this

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,079
room have something to share with other

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,550
people

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,070
you just don't know it yet so so these

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,440
are all the places that I've been since

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,199
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,710
except for Japan Japan is a trip that is

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,320
upcoming in October I will spend a month

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,710
and a half there so that just gives you

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,260
a visual idea of where I've been and

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,240
this is what most people most people

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,780
don't ask me how I am they ask me where

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,560
I am so I'm kind of used to that no

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,060
that's fine

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,240
you don't care about me I see so let's

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,550
talk about we're gonna talk about today

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,889
this is going to be a primer on

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:07,530
woocommerce so if you already have a

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:10,110
store I'm going to show you other ways

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,080
to make money with it if you don't have

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,080
a story yet maybe you should maybe start

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,900
one and we're gonna briefly talk about

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,060
payment gateways and security because

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,150
those are two very important things but

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,190
there are other people on this very same

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,400
track in this room who will talk to you

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,380
about those things in general I mean in

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,770
depth I'm just going to cover them

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,060
briefly because I'm going to demo

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,889
WooCommerce I'm going to show you if you

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,800
don't have a store already I'm going to

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,740
show you that how how easy it is to set

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,260
up in a few minutes I'm gonna start with

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,360
a blank WordPress site and add

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,020
WooCommerce just like anyone in this

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,020
room would

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,890
so ye why would you want to start a

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,710
store there are a lot of reasons why

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,450
first as you may have heard in the news

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,430
there's a lot of physical stores closing

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,230
it's not because they're out of business

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,270
and it's not because they're not making

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,400
sales it's because no one wants to go to

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,920
that store anymore not even clothing

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,510
stores you would think that people want

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,470
to go to the clothing store and try on

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:22,200
things no they buy online through their

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,980
device either there's their phone or

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:29,160
their iPad or their laptop and they have

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,830
everything sent to them the other thing

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:37,530
that's a booming that someone else will

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:39,360
talk about today is subscriptions it's

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,290
got some subscriptions is a growing

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,800
market where you buy a product say

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:49,230
you're like shampoo or your favorites a

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,790
hair oil or something like that and you

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,070
have it delivered to you on a monthly

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,020
basis because that's how often you need

00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,550
it and sometimes you can't find it in

00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,070
the store so it's really convenient to

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,180
just get in the mail the other thing

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:05,340
that's a myth is that you need to be big

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,790
like Amazon to be successful and that is

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:12,900
not true you can be you can specialize

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,880
in one thing or one vertical like North

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,000
Face does like outdoor clothing and you

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,450
can be very successful I was searching

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,230
for I was live I was in Stockholm at the

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:27,900
time and the ground was frozen and I was

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,210
looking for spikes or chains that you

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,820
can put on your feet and i've found yaks

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,310
tracks and that's all they do is spikes

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,710
and chains for your feet now they don't

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:41,940
only sell online they their place that

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:43,620
REI and other outdoor places but that is

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,230
all they do and they're very good at it

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,390
so and then the other thing too is

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,660
content is something that you can create

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:54,000
to drive traffic to your store you have

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,550
an identity you have a voice you you can

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,550
use it you can display your personality

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,600
online and you can attract people and

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:07,940
sales to your store

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:10,190
from your home so so like I said today

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,260
we're gonna talk about these two things

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:16,040
how many people already have a

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:20,500
WooCommerce store okay and how many

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,500
people maybe want to deserve one Oh

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,820
so before we get into that I want to I

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,880
want to just talk briefly about how to

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,720
choose a payment method you will get my

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,070
slides by the way and all of the links

00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,830
so you don't have to remember all these

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,419
things necessarily take notes but I want

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,039
to I want to mention these two things

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,950
briefly because getting paid and

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,850
security are pretty pretty basic things

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,020
of your site that you need to have a lot

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,010
of times we need to choose a payment

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,900
gateway it is it is it depends on a lot

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:01,820
of things so all those things on the

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:04,400
list and then it's up to you about what

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,670
your business is what do you intend

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,370
valium to be who are your customers do

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,130
you want to a free gateway or do you

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,780
want to pay for a gateway what are the

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:20,900
transaction fees that are associated

00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:23,180
with it is it scalable so if you start

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,710
small maybe the transaction fee should

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,390
be small and then as you get bigger

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,220
maybe they'll increase by like a

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,140
percentage

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,510
how many gate gateways do you need on

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,580
your store I always recommend that you

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:37,330
have at least two because if one fails

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,040
then someone can still check out and

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:43,250
then if you're going to sell

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,200
subscriptions then you want to make sure

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,340
that you have support for recurring

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,900
payments not all gateways have that and

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,240
then it also depends on what kind of

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,790
business if you're if you if you have a

00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:02,870
physical store maybe that will be a

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:04,400
factor when deciding security though the

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:10,220
one thing that I want to impress upon

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:13,000
you with security is a wait a minute I

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,840
just want to mention in this same room

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,280
John who

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,990
standing here just a few minutes ago

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,340
he's gonna talk about payment gateways

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,380
in depth

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,350
I believe that's after lunch he's doing

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:30,290
it and then okay so back to security

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:32,630
says security SSL you've probably heard

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,690
of that before you need an SSL

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,580
certificate and it's even easier these

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,860
days to get one because you don't even

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,950
need to pay for one you can get a free

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,970
one with let's encrypt and what that

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,830
does in general is the security helps to

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,700
protect the sensitive data that's being

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,830
transmitted between your site and the

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,460
the site that is processing the payment

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,670
so no one comes in and and steals that

00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,980
information and when people just shop on

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,320
your site they want to know that you're

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,240
protected so they are protected and they

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,280
can trust you and they feel safe to buy

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,400
from you and that's the general idea of

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,620
security like I said I will include

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,170
links and there's resources at the end

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,090
and you can just look at my slides and

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,650
look at all the different links and read

00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,870
for yourself you don't need to remember

00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,050
all this but I wanted to mention these

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:32,300
two things because they're important

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:34,730
okay so it's workshop time so we're

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,360
gonna go through and set up a store and

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:41,510
I'm gonna show you how it's done and

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:45,140
you're going to if you want to do it now

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:47,080
or you can you can also do it later but

00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:51,670
I'm going to do it live in front of you

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:54,770
just to show you that it can be very

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,540
user friendly and then after that for

00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,520
people who already have a store I'm

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,130
going to talk about subscriptions and

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:05,900
I'm gonna talk about bookings and these

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:08,570
are two ways that you can add tears to

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,890
an existing store just and you don't

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,410
have to necessarily change anything

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,740
about your about your existing sewer

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,720
it's just about offering more so does

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:22,370
does anyone have any questions at this

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,870
moment before we go on or are you going

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,830
to just select save them to all to the

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,670
end

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,670
okay

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:55,949
yep yeah I'm gonna have to okay so this

00:12:52,230 --> 00:13:02,850
is a I'm I'm loud so I works in my favor

00:12:55,949 --> 00:13:06,470
I guess the bad thing is is that it's

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,470
not hold on

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:25,930
okay I'll tell you what I'm looking for

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,639
maybe I need to go back and adjust these

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,639
preferences again

00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:09,380
if you're wondering what I'm doing I'm

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,560
accessing my passport man a password

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:18,320
manager and I need to do this because

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:31,490
Adam attic we have a lot of passwords

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:42,260
and ok so this is a blank site I'm just

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:49,660
gonna log in this is a wordpress site so

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:54,410
you can see it's it's blank it's not ok

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:58,240
let's go back thanks for telling me cuz

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,240
that would have been bad hold on

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,000
now

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,200
there

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,380
sit there now okay

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:43,009
all right it's not ideal though cuz I

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,009
still can't see the whole thing but

00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:00,899
so anyway it's a I know I was gonna say

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,899
how come I can't see the whole thing

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:20,010
the beauty of live demo yeah see what it

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:23,800
looks in the looks like in the backend

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:28,480
well that's someone better now okay it's

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,370
not just icons yeah cuz I don't expect

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,550
you to know all the icons because

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:37,410
actually I don't even work work that way

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:41,079
so okay so this is a black site and

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:44,399
we're gonna set up WooCommerce now from

00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:49,149
the beginning we are currently not using

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:52,480
Gutenberg Gutenberg is going to be part

00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:55,540
of the next release 3.6 that is coming

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,540
in a couple of weeks but as of this

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:01,149
moment we are this is still the

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:04,290
wordpress as we know it so we're going

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,290
to add add new

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,159
I'm going to install it

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:54,540
activate okay so the thing that was

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:59,730
supposed to happen didn't oh yeah it's

00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:06,060
because because doing a live demo was

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:08,700
fun okay so normally what would happen

00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,560
and I don't know maybe it's detected

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,990
that this site has been used before

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,680
maybe that's why I didn't come up but

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:23,690
what what normally happens after you you

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:27,990
install is that the setup wizard

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:31,260
launches oh I see it is it's it

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,810
remembers that I did this before so this

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,020
is why it's showing Indonesia because

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:41,750
the last time I did it was in Jakarta

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:44,930
alright so we're in the United States

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,930
[Applause]

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:03,660
we're just gonna make up a place well

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:09,180
not totally make up but I mean it's

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:11,910
based somewhat on untruth and it's gonna

00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:18,090
prompt you for all the the necessary

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:20,310
details to set up your store there are a

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,370
lot of currencies and and there's

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:26,850
there's a lot of options here but the

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,380
mainly the location will determine a lot

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:33,630
of other things that will happen in your

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:35,610
store and then if you if you want to

00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,890
sell physical and digital products even

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,940
if you don't know which one I mean if

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,220
you know that you're an all digital

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,790
store you can go ahead and and and

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:47,610
select that but I I think that most

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:58,860
people might choose both just in case

00:19:47,610 --> 00:20:00,450
the it changes over time and then what

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,730
we're talking about earlier payment

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,920
gateways there there are a couple of

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:09,360
different payment gateways that come

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:12,090
free with WooCommerce and you can you

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,460
know you can add others you don't need

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,970
to use these you can also change your

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,560
mind you're not committed to making

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,600
these decisions and then you're locked

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,450
in you can deactivate these payment

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,880
gateways and at any time or you can

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,100
install other ones that you prefer or

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,160
that you find that are that are most

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,800
suited for you

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:41,160
so let's just I'm gonna go ahead and

00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:41,970
take the both of these and then offline

00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,150
payments

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:48,660
some people go I don't know if anyone

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:51,810
takes checks anymore but but other

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:54,090
people if especially if they deliver

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,880
products like food or something like

00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:01,620
that they might want to accept cash on

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,860
delivery or if you're dealing with other

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:06,059
things like big transfers you might want

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,080
to go ahead and

00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:20,639
allow bank transfers as well so I'm

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:23,279
going to continue shipping usually again

00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:24,869
I don't not really sure why but did it

00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:29,639
it would normally show me different

00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:30,960
shipping options there we have a lot of

00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:34,859
different options that you can choose

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,369
from the normal ones such as like FedEx

00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,639
the US Post Office other things like

00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:41,879
that

00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:45,059
we also have WooCommerce services that's

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:47,839
offered through jetpack but not

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:51,089
everybody wants to install jetpack so

00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:58,229
and then you want to choose the weight

00:21:51,089 --> 00:22:05,580
and and and dimensions the units for

00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:08,700
these I'm going to continue most people

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,989
when they think about marketing their

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,889
products or keeping in touch with

00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:18,960
customers might want to use MailChimp in

00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:21,779
order to create like a newsletter I'm

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,599
not gonna I'm and then automated taxes

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:27,479
something that's also offered through

00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,899
jetpack I'm gonna uncheck this actually

00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,899
because

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:50,340
okay so the store the basic store now is

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:54,100
set up so that only took a few minutes

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:56,770
ignoring the fact that I was talking and

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,470
we had some issues at the beginning but

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,900
and now you're you're basically ready to

00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,210
start setting up your store if you have

00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,270
an existing store that you want to pour

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:10,900
it over to WooCommerce you can put that

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,490
on an on a CSV file in a certain format

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,180
and then just import them all at the

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:18,370
same time or if this is your first time

00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,980
creating a store which for many of you

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,290
it will be you can just go right to

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,390
creating a product if you want to go

00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:28,180
there or maybe you want to go to the

00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:31,770
dashboard and and just explore and look

00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:36,010
around that's totally fine too we have

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:38,710
documentation which I've written that

00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:42,760
can help you and in a couple of weeks

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:44,770
with the the launch our our videos will

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,420
be back online they're there they

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,280
haven't been online for the last year

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,850
but they're being updated at this moment

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:54,400
and can a lot of people like to have

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,320
video because it helps them visually to

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,230
walk through the steps not everybody

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,240
loves written documentation everybody

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:05,140
learns differently so those are going to

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,560
be vac available to everybody so you can

00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:15,550
go to getting started which is a doc and

00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:17,470
this link I believe is not it's not

00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:23,200
viable at this moment I believe it goes

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:26,350
back to two Doc's it does okay so you

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,490
can go to the the Doc's to getting

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:33,460
started and take a look of what you

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,050
might want to do first or you can just

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,430
go to the dashboard and have a look

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:43,330
around again everybody learns

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:45,550
differently I like to go around and

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,480
explore the dashboard and just see

00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,480
what's there

00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:59,630
everything should be blank because we

00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,630
just set it up

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:09,390
most of your settings for WooCommerce

00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:18,870
will be under WooCommerce settings and I

00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:22,320
believe there's a there's a whole page

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:28,289
with that and walks you it walks you

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,610
through all of it some of these things

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:32,070
you've already done already with the

00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:34,409
with the setup wizard that it goes ahead

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,960
and puts you through some of these

00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:41,210
decisions already and so they were

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,210
already going to be inserted for you

00:25:53,100 --> 00:26:00,180
there shouldn't be any orders yet

00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:03,950
because it's brand-new does anyone have

00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,950
any questions at this moment

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:23,940
so down here is products add new and

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,110
you'll see if you've used WordPress

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,309
before the this screen looks very

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:34,799
familiar doesn't it

00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:40,340
uh-huh what's to have documentation on

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:40,340
that as well in case setup products

00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:56,280
but if you just let's just go to the

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:59,250
screen here and just take a look okay so

00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:08,270
a product name let's just say we want to

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:08,270
set up I don't know yeah why not

00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:21,700
we don't have any categories set up yet

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,700
but we can set one up

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:33,989
and then this this place that you would

00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:37,169
normally write like a post is the

00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:42,119
description and then down here is all

00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:44,639
the product data so if this is going to

00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,849
be a tip like a t-shirt that comes in

00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:50,129
different sizes and different colors it

00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:57,840
would not be a simple product it would

00:27:50,129 --> 00:28:03,649
be a variable product and that is a

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,649
separate page of documentation here a

00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:12,950
[Applause]

00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:12,950
variable product is something that has

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:21,989
yeah exactly

00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:25,679
green blue yellow small medium large if

00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:28,339
it's just if it's just like um I don't

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,859
know like a sticker

00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:34,339
you only have one it would be a simple

00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:34,339
product

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:53,840
trying to think of what would be a

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:56,539
variable digital product I think

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,970
normally when you set up files they if

00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:02,029
they're different they should be from

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:04,549
separate products that way you can track

00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:09,260
how many you've sold of each a lot

00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:11,990
easier not only that but I think that if

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,580
you have something even if it's a

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,169
variation and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,299
gonna give you an example because this

00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:20,000
is this came to me when I was in Madrid

00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:23,000
and this this woman she had a store that

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,720
she was building for a fashion designer

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,169
who only designed bikinis and so in her

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,659
mind they were all bikinis and so that

00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:35,210
was just a variable product and I was

00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:38,120
thinking well not know because there's

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,740
triangle tops and there's Bandos and

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,409
there's and then there's different

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:46,190
bottoms but not only that but because

00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:48,350
this was a visual product I thought it

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:52,190
would be better if she showed her her

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:55,429
entire catalog so it was fine to like

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,870
you know to make a product that was it

00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:00,289
was still a variable product but was

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:03,799
only very variations in size they were

00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:06,740
not variations in colors or or you know

00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:09,740
types of tops or anything like that and

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,230
so that way when people looked at her

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,529
her catalog they could see like all the

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:18,440
beautiful designs that she had and so if

00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:20,240
I mean if they were just files they were

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,640
just digital files I mean I'm not really

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,899
sure I think it would depend on what

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,860
kind of files they were you may wanted

00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:32,539
to it could be a variable product maybe

00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,990
you have different tiers or something

00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:38,419
but if you have if you wanted to show

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,039
off to your customers how many different

00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:44,200
things that you had it probably be

00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,200
better he made them all different

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,270
because if they have to dig for whether

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,440
you have it or not I think that's that

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,529
might lead to

00:30:51,440 --> 00:31:00,370
sale and you know you don't want to lose

00:30:54,529 --> 00:31:00,370
somebody you have it so let's just say

00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:41,510
so let's say you have 10 here back

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:43,250
orders no cuz if you if you only have 10

00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:46,700
and you're not going to order anymore

00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,920
then you don't want back orders low

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:52,100
stock threshold do you want to be

00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,690
alerted when there's low stock well if

00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,280
they're gonna sell out and you're not

00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,280
going to reorder then probably no

00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:14,390
and then this is where your product

00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:18,020
dimensions come in you need to enter a

00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:20,900
weight and also dimensions because this

00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:22,570
will help calculate shipping so I don't

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:30,289
know how much a t-shirt would weigh but

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:31,640
it's six ounces and I don't know if we

00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:39,730
need to put this in but I'm just gonna

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:39,730
put it in anyway Thanks

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:52,179
they the shipping the shipping gateway

00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:54,409
will automatically calculate what it is

00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:56,419
this is the reason why I like with a

00:32:54,409 --> 00:33:03,110
t-shirt because it can be folded up I'm

00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:04,640
not really sure if this is but it the to

00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,250
answer your question the the shipping

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,610
gateway will automatically calculate

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:13,880
based on the weight and the dimensions

00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:17,419
of things what the best box or envelope

00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,059
might be and then it will return it and

00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:22,700
then you I believe that if there are

00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:24,500
different options it does give the

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,659
customer different options to choose

00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,659
from and what that will cost

00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,480
we don't have any shipping classes set

00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,480
up at this moment

00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:36,040
and

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:39,550
okay well yeah yeah the attributes the

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:42,520
attributes contribute to the variations

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:44,980
this is I guess is the reason like I

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,169
usually don't like to get into variable

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,929
products for the especially when we're

00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:53,380
doing it for the first time because it

00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:56,110
can be it can become confusing at first

00:34:53,380 --> 00:35:10,300
it's it's actually I like to start with

00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:11,860
simple products first I think a lot of

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,650
women in this room can relate to that

00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:22,330
right hmm so so okay it's let's go back

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:31,120
to simple products oh so the regular

00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:33,370
price would be I don't know 15 sale

00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,320
price well if you don't have to enter a

00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,690
sale price if you don't want to but you

00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:42,720
do need to enter a price for the the

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,720
object if it is not free so

00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:57,020
and then under advance you can add some

00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:59,300
notes or you can also enable reviews for

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:03,800
the product I'm not gonna enable reviews

00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:06,430
because well and then these are the

00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:10,790
basic things that we just went through

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:13,369
you're you're almost ready to publish it

00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:19,430
and what's missing is in a product image

00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:26,330
so a product image is over here and

00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:28,580
we're not gonna sell coffee so oops

00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:40,730
sorry I'm so sorry

00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:42,980
oh gosh this wildlife demo is hard so

00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:45,859
we're just gonna I'm just gonna do this

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,359
really quick because we're not this is

00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:51,400
just an example but you've obviously

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,400
want to take your own photos and

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,430
Oh No if you had a an object or an item

00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,580
that you're selling and that had

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:34,470
different views as a front and back and

00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:38,820
sides and you wanted to show it off like

00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:41,490
jewelry or something like that you might

00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,680
want to create a gallery down here and

00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,420
then it gives you the option to upload a

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,980
lot of images and then the person

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:55,530
whoever is looking at the product can

00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:59,970
scroll through them I'm looking at all t

00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:08,670
tags well I might just buy t-shirts and

00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:10,590
black and I think we're ready to publish

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,560
the the product I don't see anything

00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:19,470
else that is a basic that we haven't

00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,190
covered this short description is

00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,490
optional

00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:27,089
it could help search if you wanted to

00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:29,130
put in something there but usually your

00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:30,000
your product description up here is just

00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:34,070
fine

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,070
so it's publish

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:47,130
and now the shirt is there if you wanted

00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:48,900
to see a site that's a little bit more

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,900
populated well I guess I can no because

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:55,530
I'd have to exit again but I had a I

00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:59,070
have a a store that is my test site over

00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:04,280
here well at some point I'm gonna have

00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:04,280
to log out and I can show you

00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:16,410
the thing is is I because of the

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,440
passport manager is hidden again I would

00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:22,680
need to get out of it out of this view

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:29,400
again like I did before and then subject

00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:34,940
you all to you know that again I'm not a

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:37,680
big deal but I'm just worrying you so

00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,450
technically you're ready to after you

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,130
set up your your shipping and your

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,130
payment gateway you're ready to sell

00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,880
let's go back here

00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:55,170
there aren't any payment gateway of

00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:56,820
weathers a PayPal and okay so it's not

00:39:55,170 --> 00:40:00,300
set up at this moment because I wouldn't

00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:03,780
need to sign up for an account but the

00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:06,450
basics of of starting to sell would be

00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:10,640
the payment gateway your security your

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,640
products and then your shipping

00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:19,230
and the shipping tab is here and we need

00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,800
to get rid of this one because it's not

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,800
Indonesia

00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:35,119
sure so

00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,500
so we have a usps shipping method here

00:40:49,700 --> 00:41:00,049
and you would need to purchase this and

00:40:55,819 --> 00:41:03,869
install it on your site I can show you I

00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:18,420
think I can download a download one and

00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:20,490
show you a we do oh my gosh time goes so

00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,660
quick doesn't app ok so I didn't even

00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,970
get to show you anything with

00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,940
subscriptions or anything but I hope

00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:30,240
that someone else is going to do a

00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:34,470
subscriptions talk today it is who is it

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,059
it's is it a meet I believe he's going

00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:38,160
to show you how to build a subscription

00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,749
business but what I wanted to what I

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:48,480
wanted to show you really quick if you

00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:51,299
is if you had a if she already had a

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,740
WooCommerce store for those people who

00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:56,359
are in this room who already have Google

00:41:52,740 --> 00:42:00,390
commerce or you can do things like

00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:02,789
install subscriptions and then how

00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:04,890
people subscribe to that product on a

00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:08,759
monthly basis or a weekly basis or

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:14,069
whatever it is and that can generate

00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:15,930
recurring sales for you it's there early

00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:17,849
pre-authorized through the payment

00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:20,670
gateway so you wouldn't need to invoice

00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:22,200
them every month or every year it would

00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,700
just automatically take the money and

00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,920
then you would need to deliver their

00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,549
products on whatever interval they

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,549
selected

00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:47,720
sorry which one it's a plugin I'd hope -

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,880
yes let me show you all I have the links

00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,670
and everything in my in my in the

00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,790
resources that I'll give you and my

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:59,090
slides but it is a it is a plugin that

00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:02,120
you would buy separately and it is is

00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:07,610
managed by a really great team Pross

00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:09,710
press and you can add this to a product

00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:12,910
that you already sell and offer say like

00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:17,800
if you sold hair products or if you sold

00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:20,360
actually anything to be honest let's see

00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:25,610
it's called WooCommerce subscriptions

00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:30,230
it's not complicated it's it's it's so

00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:34,970
you can find it basically but so for

00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:41,060
instance this coffee place they offer

00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:43,130
these sold on on an individual basis but

00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,440
they also offer them on a subscription

00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:50,300
basis too so you would get a different

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:54,080
coffee every month for in sand the same

00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:55,160
with this mystery chocolate box year do

00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,040
you don't know what you're buying you

00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,840
know it's chocolate though and you can

00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,820
sign up for three six or twelve months

00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,670
and you get a different box of chocolate

00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:07,090
every month which i think is really cool

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,090
actually

00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,200
okay

00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,800
you had there's different options oh

00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,960
yeah you I'm sorry we have to so the

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,300
question is he wants he was asking about

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,090
fulfillment if there's different

00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:36,190
companies that you can work with you can

00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:38,050
actually work with Amazon Fulfillment if

00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:41,710
you'd like and they come and pick up

00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:45,220
your products and then when people buy

00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:46,870
from you they fulfil them for you but

00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,790
that is not the only option there are

00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:51,670
other options out there as well that you

00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:56,350
can research but that is probably the

00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:59,170
most popular one and recognizable as

00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:01,300
well so it offers tracking and

00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:19,240
everything for everybody who buys from

00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:22,360
you okay another PayPal account you can

00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:24,280
use your the question is if you already

00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:27,040
have a PayPal account do you need to

00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,350
start a new one if you want to do this

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,290
first or can you use the existing one

00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:36,370
and the answer is it depends if you are

00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:39,340
okay with using your existing one and if

00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:41,740
it's a personal one you want to convert

00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:44,440
it to a business account and then you

00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:46,930
can use it it's be the same email

00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,880
attached or if you want to keep them

00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:51,240
separate then you would sign up for a

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,240
new one

00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:05,350
thank for that it's already included in

00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:09,440
PayPal you have to like if it's already

00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:19,400
included with the account that you're

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:23,750
using then no sorry you can put me in

00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,480
the hallway and you can talk to me all

00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,220
you want I'll be here all day

00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,840
working part of the magic is also the

00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:39,440
conversation in the hallway it's the

00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:41,870
hallway track everybody sorry I thought

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:46,840

00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,840
[Applause]
