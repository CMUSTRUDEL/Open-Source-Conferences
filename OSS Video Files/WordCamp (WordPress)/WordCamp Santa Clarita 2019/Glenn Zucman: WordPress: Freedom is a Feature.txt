Title: Glenn Zucman: WordPress: Freedom is a Feature
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	Why are you blogging? Most of us create content because weâ€™re told we should, but not many of us know why. In this session, Glenn Zucman will talk about how you can work smarter rather than harder to create content that actually makes an impact on your business.

thank you so I've been to events where

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,539
the day is scheduled so that the best

00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:20,250
speaker is last I have also been to

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,650
events where the day is scheduled so

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,619
that the least interesting speaker is

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,679
last so you will have to tell me which

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:35,160
wave today was structured in a little

00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:36,300
while if you want to get also with no

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,879
disrespect to all the other awesome

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,520
speakers I don't understand why people

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,930
make slides for talks when you could

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,620
just make a WordPress website for a talk

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:51,780
so if you would like to get to my slides

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,699

feature both links take you to the same

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:18,810
place which is this set of pages or

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:23,189
topics so our topics for today we have 8

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,350
things to go through we have so I don't

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,119
have enough for the whole room but a few

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:33,329
select lucky attendees today will get a

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,509
prize or a gift something free free

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,890
stuff because it's all about free and

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,689
then we want to say a little bit about

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,630
an interesting art project called Google

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,360
AdWords happening then we'll talk about

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,439
WordPress is it being open source also

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,520
hi it's me a little bit about free

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,460
speech and free beer then we're talking

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,040
about the four freedoms we talk about

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,649
Firefox and another rep browser called

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,820
water fox where you talk about soup this

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,140
is probably the most important part of

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,320
the talk is the soup I know you think

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,220
the beer is but the soup is kind of

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,550
you'll see in a minute and then we're

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,430
talking about community so let's dive in

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,980
we'll start with the free stuff so I

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,580
brought some gifts for a few lucky

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,959
attendees today and of course if I just

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,190
pick the gift for you that wouldn't

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,410
really be about the freedom we're

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,050

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:15,110
okay so let the record show that we

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:18,380
enlightened informed erudite attendees

00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:23,240
of WordCamp sounded Korea to 2019 have

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:26,960
chosen free beer over free speech two to

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:30,440
one or four to two more on that in a

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,180
minute but let me tell you about this

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,500
interesting so if we're going to really

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,240
get into WordPress in the stack but

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,699
before we do let me say a little bit

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,919
more about free and freedom and tell you

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:44,750
about this interesting project that this

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:47,510
artist did a few years back so this is

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:52,039
an artist named Christoph Bruno and his

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:56,110
project of 2002 so 17 years ago is

00:04:52,039 --> 00:05:00,200
Google AdWords happening so as you know

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:03,200
you can go to Adwords and you can buy

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,570
words and so if I am selling widgets I

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,410
can buy the word widget and then when

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,789
somebody comes and searches for widget

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,650
you know there's the organic search and

00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,479
then there's the sponsored content that

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,910
would come around people would see my

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,710
sponsored purchasing of the word widget

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,780
and maybe they buy a widget from me

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,760
so Christoph Bruno said well I think I

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,930
will do a project with Google Adwords

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,539
but instead of selling a widget if

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:32,180
somebody searches on the word maybe

00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:35,660
depression I will give them a column

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:40,070
about love so his idea was to serve

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:44,210
poems instead of commodities so in 24

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,830
hours he served 12,000 poems to people

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,840
for keywords that he had purchased and

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,060
at the end of 24 hours

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,330
Google figured out what he was doing and

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,479
they banned him and they said

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,960
you are perverting the system you may

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:04,789
not use Google AdWords for art you can

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,169
only sell commodities here so that's a

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,509
whole other conversation that we don't

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,759
need to have today but as part of the

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:14,509
documentation of his project he

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:18,259
published the prices of some words at

00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:20,300
that time back in 20 2002 which is what

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,949
I want to just kind of offer for your

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,400
consideration before we dive in a little

00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:28,250
more to WordPress and freedom so here's

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,979
his table of the prices of some words so

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,449
back in 2002 Britney Spears was worth

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:36,289
144 bucks

00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:45,229
bin Laden was worth $24 and apparently

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:49,699
Anil was worth 319 so here's something

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:51,469
interesting the word free as we

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,979
demonstrated just moments ago in this

00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:56,240
very room the word free of the words he

00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,949
looked up I don't know about all words

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,289
in the English language of the words he

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,840
looked up free was the most expensive

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:05,930
word at seven-and-a-half thousand

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,310
dollars one of the cheapest words in all

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:16,250
of AdWords is freedom at a buck eighty

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:22,370
eight it would seem that we will pay

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:25,069
almost any price for free beer but if I

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:31,190
might be so bold we don't give a crap

00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:32,270
about freedom also interesting so

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,509
there's lots of other interesting things

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:38,509
in his table here but kind of similar to

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:45,139
free versus freedom you'll notice that

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:47,240
sex is a $3,800 word but love is only a

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,849
1200 other word it's not as big a gap as

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,500
free and freedom but once again sex

00:07:49,849 --> 00:08:02,570
would seem to be worth three times more

00:07:51,500 --> 00:08:07,520
to us than love well yeah and if you're

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:10,009
if you're curious I've got a link to the

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,169
project where you can see more so anyway

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:18,589
some thoughts of it well let me ask you

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:20,599
actually what is freedom anybody it's

00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:23,810
not a trick question do you have an

00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:30,949
answer yes or no you're just really

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:33,020
listening intently freedom is

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:36,440
opportunity that's awesome what about

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:40,250
you guys what's freedom the freedom to

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,569
do what I want okay what else is freedom

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,569
other other thoughts yeah

00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,959
yeah so there's a fitness salman rushdie

00:08:55,489 --> 00:09:00,170
quotation that's very similar to what

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,519
you just said he was talking

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,699
specifically about the crown but you

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,799
could apply it to almost anything that

00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:09,049
when we are not allowed to think new

00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,819
thoughts that you know our lives are

00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:19,040
constrained in really powerful ways

00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:21,110
so we now it could be it's possible that

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,379
that more people chose for the free beer

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,410
today because my free speech wasn't was

00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:31,399
not that cool it's a little bit cheesy

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:33,709
but that is free speech free speech is

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,360
messy free speech is uncomfortable if

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:41,509
you are the Jewish ACLU lawyer do you go

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,149
to court to defend the neo-nazi right to

00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:48,829
march free speech is not always

00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:52,670
comfortable but as Americans I think we

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:54,110
think it matters not to go money deeper

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,579
into politics let's go into something

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,670
that's really cool and gives you sort of

00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:02,649
free speech on free beer which is

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,649
probably also why you're here today

00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:17,129
so WordPress and also WordPress is open

00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:19,069
source and also hi it's me so how many

00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:22,800
are familiar with Creative Commons

00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:24,240
everybody is okay so obvious in then you

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,529
know what open-source software is also

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,149
yes great so everything that I create I

00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,569
make is license Creative Commons

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,240
Attribution feel free to use it remix it

00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:38,850
destroy it tear apart whatever you like

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,990
I teach art at Long Beach State here's a

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,370
couple of the websites from those

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,259
classes I teach there here's my

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,059
portfolio I've been doing a lot of

00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:46,769
photography lately you can see my street

00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:49,290
photography my photojournalism some

00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:50,699
nonfiction photography I did a series on

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,899
Donald Trump star and Hollywood

00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:56,490
Boulevard so there's a thing called

00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:59,339
object-oriented ontology which is kind

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:02,040
of about this objects having autonomy

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,779
and I've sort of created this website

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,430
about water you can take a look at that

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:14,490
we've got a lot of selfies all most

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:16,439
importantly the haircolor website so

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:21,600
here you can see various shades of my

00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:26,040
hair and Emma Stone's hair and if you

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,779
check the menu you can see all the Emma

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,429
Stone pictures or all the Glenn pictures

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,740
or the different levels of hair color

00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:32,970
from light from dark to light or the

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:40,620
different tones whatever you want to

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:41,370
look up it's all available so enough

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,470
about me

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,110
well almost enough about me here's a

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:49,769
bonus question see if anybody knows I

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,589
have two beers and a lot of free speech

00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:54,149
left

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:57,230
what do street photography and open

00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:57,230
source software have in common

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:24,480
so so for that excellent even if prime

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,480
dancer you win free speech and free beer

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,399
so in order to fully explain this answer

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,370
I have to give you my sad confession and

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,100
I should say I am a free culture

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,230
advocate a lot of you I mean how do you

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,300
why are we here let me back up before we

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,910
get to my second confession how many

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,839
people are creating ecommerce sites

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:56,709
things like that a lot of us are there

00:12:52,839 --> 00:13:00,910
any bloggers a lot of us so what all are

00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:05,760
we using WordPress for for example sell

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,760
movies plays okay awesome I like that

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:32,230
personal growth and fitness awesome to

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:34,120
sell my aunt nice awesome information so

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,300
that's a great range of things and I

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,310
guess what I want to just mention is I'm

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,450
not really anti people making money so

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,790
there are when the plenty of occasions

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,990
when things would want to be copyrighted

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,480
and I'm not really saying that that

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,089
shouldn't exist but the world that I'm

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,100
personally interested in is more a free

00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:54,190
culture and an open source software kind

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:58,839
of world so the sad confession is that

00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:00,760
for 2007 everything that I created I put

00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,760
Circle C copyright all rights reserved

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,029
on and then a couple of things happened

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,250
in 2007 in the summer of oh seven I went

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,750
to a event somewhat like this was a

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,120
different topic slightly was called

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,120
pixel Odeon it was the first annual

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,670
pixel Odeon and it turned out to be the

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,540
last annual pixel Odeon but it was an

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,889
awesome event

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,889
and among all the other great things

00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,570
that happened was I had a pretty

00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,000
extended conversation with a guy named

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,399
John Phillips who at the time was an

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,660
evangelist for Creative Commons I didn't

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,880
really even know much about Creative

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,519
Commons at the time but our conversation

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,930
really stirred a lot of ideas for me and

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,339
then a couple months later I went to

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,029
another event this one was called

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:44,949
BarCamp Los Angeles and there I had this

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:46,959
long conversation with Richard Stallman

00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:49,360
and between John Phillips and Richard

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:53,290
Stallman it was kind of Mike Damascene

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,750
conversion and suddenly I had converted

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,139
to the Church of free culture and today

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,329
again not objecting to anybody earning a

00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:03,490
living but today when I see that circle

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:06,069
see it's like a slap in the face to me

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,860
it just hurts it just hurts to see

00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:13,630
things locked down when I'd like things

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:15,399
to move freely you know when I teach at

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,990
Long Beach sometimes when I just have

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,519
people do stuff now I don't really give

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,829
lectures anymore but when I use think of

00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:24,790
lectures I would look for images for the

00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:27,790
lectures and you could do a Google

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:30,190
search and steal somebody's image you

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,529
could go to Flickr and find something

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,290
that was good for your talk and you

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,519
could ask for permission and what

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,880
happens if you ask somebody if you can

00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:43,149
use their Flickr photo 87% of the time

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:50,079
the answer is no reply whatsoever you

00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:52,360
never hear back and then 11 percent of

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,860
the time the answer is yes but it comes

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,370
three weeks later and you needed it

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,279
tomorrow

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,990
and then 1% of the time people actually

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,970
say yes right away almost nobody ever

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,569
says no mostly you just don't get a

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,130
reply or you could go to Flickr and do a

00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:07,510
Creative Commons search and find an

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,939
image that someone has already allowed

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,490
you to use so for simple things like

00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:15,130
just finding an image for a talk at

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,230
school that sure if you just stole it

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,360
off the web nothing would ever really

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,439
happen but you're you're kind of

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,230
breaking the rules

00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:25,389
Creative Commons allows someone who's

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,620
taken a photo that they love that

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:28,750
they're not trying to sell through

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,339
anybody particularly and lets you use it

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,769
in your lecture at school or do other

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:35,860
things so it's really been an empower

00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:38,050
bring adventure for me okay enough about

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,749
me and adventures let's say a couple

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,230
words about WordPress probably why we're

00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,619
here

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:52,179
so as you yeah I jump in on anything

00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:54,610
anytime yes oh I didn't answer it did I

00:16:52,179 --> 00:17:00,399
know you probably did

00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:04,929
does street photography require a talent

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:08,409
release and if not when does public

00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:11,039
either video or photography when does it

00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:13,689
step into the realm of talent really

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,339
good question and I realized that I that

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,240
I didn't actually answer the question

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,299
but we didn't answer my own question so

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,539
in America and many other countries

00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:27,880
although probably not all you can walk

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:29,919
down the street and take a picture you

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,500
don't have to ask for permission you can

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,490
just it's public space and you can take

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,929
a picture in public space you can do

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,350
almost anything you want with that

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:40,659
picture

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,750
except you cannot use it for commercial

00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:47,049
purposes so if you want to sell some

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:52,059
product with it then you would need one

00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:53,919
or many releases but you could make a

00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:55,179
big print stick it in an art gallery and

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,909
you could sell it for money in the

00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,809
gallery as a art object and even that is

00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:00,669
acceptable

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:04,960
it's just commercial basically

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:07,600
advertising when you couldn't and and

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,510
does that cover that yeah that's great

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,220
and the answer to my own question which

00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:18,450
is kind of answered already but I since

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:23,440
2007 had been a free culture open source

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:25,419
zealot but didn't until last summer make

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,090
this connection I was attending a

00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:30,429
program in Hollywood at a an institution

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,960
called the free school of architecture

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,250
so given the title free school of

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,159
architecture you can already tell I was

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,870
having a blast at this place and one day

00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,490
they asked us to walk down the street

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,059
they were actually located on Hollywood

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,260
Boulevard walk down the street and have

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,750
an experience and then come back and

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,160
write an essay about it so I walked down

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,560
Holly

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,650
Boulevard and I turned down Cahuenga

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,090
heading south toward sunset and I passed

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,590
this lot where I don't know if there's

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,230
gonna be some big part of your concert

00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,060
or whatever later on but just this gate

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,710
and this big bouncer guy and he just

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,140
kind of stared at me like how dare you

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,940
walk down my piece of street somebody

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,520
else came along with some you know fancy

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,200
credential and he opened the gate for

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:15,090
that person to get in and then closed it

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,830
and it sort of occurred to me that the

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,350
amazing thing about the street is that

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,970
you don't have to know people you don't

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,170
have to have status you don't have to

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,050
have money you don't have to have

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,460
credentials the street is one of the few

00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,260
places there are a lot of streets but

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,130
streets and parks our place our public

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,990
places that we own as a group and you

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,370
can go there even if you don't have the

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,010
friends the connections the money the

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:40,410
status the whatever and it occurred to

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:44,370
me that the street is an open source

00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:46,850
platform so that was that was an another

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,040
part I guess part two of my epiphany

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:56,970
okay I think I think that was the enough

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:58,500
about me section so you already know

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,420
that WordPress is open source and there

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,640
are you know a number of really great

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,220
open source platforms like joomla drupal

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,150
jekyll ghost and then there are all

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:11,670
kinds of closed source or proprietary

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,840
platforms that you might make a website

00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,010
for any of the things we all talked

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,170
about just a minute ago

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,730
like Squarespace WIC anything that

00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,730
begins with W that isn't WordPress

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,800
basically Wix Weebly there's actually do

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,270
you know this I've not made this up

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,260
there's actually a platform called other

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,240
people's pixels dot-com so built into

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,120
the name of the website they're telling

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,230
you right up front that you are building

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,630
your house on somebody else's property

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:43,800
which is if you think about it kind of

00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:45,150
nuts and obviously with social media

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,600
like Facebook and many others I think

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,190
everybody today understands that anybody

00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,460
everybody familiar with the film Soylent

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,070
Green yeah so something like green

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,900
predates the Internet but obviously on

00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,640
social media today it's valuable I'm not

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,840
telling you not to use it but you know

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,909
we do understand that they

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:13,500
we are all digital fluent green at this

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:25,620
point so we do yeah nobody's ever seen

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:29,659
it we just know what it is so here's

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:32,130
here's a couple guys you probably know

00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:34,950
Tim O'Reilly and Richard Stallman so

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:38,399
Richard Solomon everybody are you

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:41,220
familiar with his story so he was a

00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:43,710
programmer at MIT using the UNIX system

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,500
and he loved UNIX and he loved being a

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:51,649
programmer at MIT and he was like in

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:54,840
heaven but he began to realize that

00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:57,090
proprietary software was limiting what

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,070
you could do and limiting operability

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,070
and so he ultimately left his dream job

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,809
at MIT and founded the free software

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:07,409
movement and the reason they have these

00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:08,760
signs so so Tim O'Reilly talking about

00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,580
open source which is what most people

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,200
talk about these days probably but

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,450
Richard Stallman insists on the term

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,419
free software because he thinks free is

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:21,570
such an important word and you might see

00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:24,750
the terms Libre and gratis so Libre

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:30,779
means well so gratis means no cost as in

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:36,330
free beer and Libre is it Liberty as in

00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:39,390
free speech and we kind of talked about

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:46,110
that so let anybody know what the four

00:22:39,390 --> 00:23:00,720
freedoms are did I just say it backwards

00:22:46,110 --> 00:23:03,169
no four freedoms and we never heard of

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,169
the four freedoms

00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,990
or constant either one tell us either

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:18,910
one or or or bonus points if you know

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:21,640
the difference in magazine probably look

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:25,270
like that that is it and what's that

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,000
about the four freedoms freedom of

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:30,100
speech worship one freedom from want and

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,080
fear free and it's that what we're

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,700
talking about today all right would say

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,960
so a little bit it is but we're talking

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,960
about a different four freedoms right

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,420
four freedoms of software yeah that

00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:50,190
anybody know okay something new yeah

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,060
that's pretty close I guess two of them

00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,740
okay so so you're correct that we we

00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,780
kind of are talking about these four

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,040
freedoms but but technically these are

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:09,160
not the four freedoms we're talking

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:11,080
about we're talking we're talking about

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,700
the freedom to use the freedom to study

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,650
the freedom to modify the freedom to

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,870
share which is the freedom that you are

00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:20,080
given whenever you use open source

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:24,220
software so use you can use it anytime

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,930
anyplace for any reason you can study it

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,300
so with closed soft close source

00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,850
software you don't have access to the

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,470
source code it just is what it is and it

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:35,170
might be useful to you and it might be

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,330
not and you don't know with open source

00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:41,380
software you can study it you can also

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:43,330
modify it you can also share it so some

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,210
of the people in this room are very

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:49,270
technical people I am NOT one of them

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:51,970
I'm an artist I don't write code so the

00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,950
question that you could ask me is well

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,680
great Glenn you have the freedom to

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,450
study WordPress or any other open source

00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,850
software and the freedom to modify it

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:07,529
but you're not very technical what good

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:11,919
does that do you glad you asked

00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:15,089
anybody familiar with Firefox anybody

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:21,489
familiar with water Fox

00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:25,869
so water Fox is a Firefox fork that this

00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:31,449
guy Alex canto started in 2011 when he

00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:34,570
was 16 so Firefox as you might know is a

00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:39,249
great open source web browser

00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:41,829
I used Firefox and then I don't know

00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:43,869
maybe a year ago they changed the

00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:46,739
architecture of Firefox in some way and

00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:49,869
a lot of older plugins no longer worked

00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:52,179
they didn't conform and a plugin that I

00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:55,359
use is called fire FTP which is how I

00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,829
FTP content to a web server now I don't

00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,259
really know to be honest I didn't take

00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:01,059
the time to find out why the

00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:02,739
architecture changed and why these older

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,199
plugins don't work I mean no doubt

00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:08,469
there's a good reason but I'm just a

00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:10,659
lazy artist so all I knew was that a

00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:13,329
plug-in I rely on to do work that I

00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:15,909
liked I need to do doesn't work anymore

00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:18,190
and the fireftp authors have I'm not

00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,959
updating it to this new architecture so

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,959
I probably a number of pass through the

00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:25,229
solution but what's kind of important to

00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:28,209
appreciate is that if this was Safari I

00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:31,869
just be out the source code isn't

00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:34,299
available it would be an inconceivable

00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:35,889
task to reverse-engineer Safari and even

00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,559
if you could somehow do it Apple would

00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:43,089
sue you but because it's an open source

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:45,219
project a 16 year old can take that code

00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:48,369
and say I'm gonna write a new version so

00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:50,769
he's focused on speed and security but

00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:52,659
also on a platform that still supports

00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:55,959
this older architecture of these plugins

00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:57,609
so even though I'm not writing code the

00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:59,619
fact that it's open source the fact that

00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:02,919
it has the freedom to study to modify to

00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:06,819
share means that I can use that Firefox

00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:09,819
this this water fox fork of Firefox and

00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:11,739
still run my fireftp and keep going the

00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:15,249
way I've been going so I've received

00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:17,679
really powerful benefits from somebody

00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:19,889
else's ability to work with open source

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,889
software

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:36,440
which brings us to soup so let's say I

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:39,559
have free gratis soup then I'm gonna

00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,770
give you for $0 so I give you this

00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:45,200
packet of soup and I say you cannot know

00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:48,530
what is inside this soup but you can

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:53,650
have it you can mix it with hot water

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:57,679
and you can eat it it will nourish you

00:27:53,650 --> 00:28:01,100
it will satisfy your appetite you just

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:04,730
don't know what you're eating so maybe

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,250
you have issues with msg or gluten or

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,250
who knows what ingredient and this soup

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:12,320
is gonna make you sick maybe you don't

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,720
have any of those kinds of issues but

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,059
maybe you're vegetarian or vegan and

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,890
this soup contains animal products so

00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:22,220
it's not gonna make you physically sick

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,809
but its soup that is going to not be

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,179
consistent with the way you choose to

00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:30,170
live in this world again you just don't

00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:33,860
know or maybe you have no ethical issues

00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:36,550
maybe you have no health issues maybe

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:40,700
you just think this soup is pretty tasty

00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:44,240
but I'm a clever kitchen person and I

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,280
think I could make tastier soup with the

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,590
packet of soup that and the unknown

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:54,980
ingredients you have nowhere to go but

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,630
with open source soup when I not only

00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,970
give you the packet of soup but I also

00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,490
give you the recipe give you the source

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:04,700
code you can look through that source

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,500
code that recipe and you can say oh look

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,960
msg I don't want this I'm gonna

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,520
substitute something else or oh look

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,160
animal products I don't want this I'm

00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,990
gonna substitute something else or hey

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,640
this is really tasty but I'm clever I

00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,679
could substitute some ingredients or add

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:24,080
these other things and make even tastier

00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:26,300
soup so with open source soup

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,850
you still get fed and I could still give

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,930
you that free packet of soup but you now

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:34,330
have options

00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:37,390
you now have flexibility also if the

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,770
soup company goes out of business you

00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,600
can still make your own soup you can

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,230
still have that recipe that you liked

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,490
where as you know again I mean apples

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,770
probably gonna be around for a while but

00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,600
if they go out of business or Google as

00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,220
you know discontinues products all the

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,820
time your favorite Google product is

00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:57,550
always going down right so you know if

00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,590
if Safari doesn't exist you're not going

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,400
to be able to fork it it yourself it's

00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,700
just dead

00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:14,080
so open-source soup is really good I

00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:15,340
think anybody know this guy yeah yeah I

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,910
don't know why I picked this slide I

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:22,270
think just cuz guys been here yeah

00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:25,900
that's the hair so this is Alex Vasquez

00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:29,620
he's uh he's a local WordPress type and

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:31,809
this is him so this is apparently are

00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,970
like the hottest chip ever made and the

00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:36,010
one chip challenge is to eat it and not

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,010
drink a glass of milk for five minutes

00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:40,540
and so this is his Facebook broadcast I

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,160
don't know why he chose Facebook but

00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,740
probably because the people are there

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,220
but anyway what I actually want to talk

00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,230
about is community though that in

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,670
addition to the other ideas that that

00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:56,440
I've just mentioned WordPress as an

00:30:54,670 --> 00:31:00,910
open-source project has the potential to

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:04,059
create community and OG look at this

00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:06,460
room this is your proof as I'm sure you

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:09,940
know there are word camps all over the

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:13,140
globe and it's just this large robust

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:16,390
community of interaction and sharing and

00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,640
it's amazing and if you think about it

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:23,530
with an open-source project the

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,640
community controls the software with a

00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:30,540
closed source project the software

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,890
controls the community so at its best

00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:36,630
open source can be an instrument of

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:41,010
empowerment at its worst closed source

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:41,010
can be an instrument of unjust power

00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,860
you guys have questions about anything

00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:55,520
thoughts questions yeah there you go

00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:04,830
okay because how many people in here do

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,750
farm the table how many people have a

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,850
farmer that they directly talked to that

00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,929
delivers their food most of us go to

00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:19,710
this store we process food all the time

00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:22,049
is that good look at me you know but no

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,610
corporate food is bad for us it's

00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:26,700
processed you know all these things but

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,470
we but we look at convenience and also

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,140
when you talk about that balance between

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,309
open source and applications that are

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,039
developed in the commercial world

00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:38,039
they're very vertical they have a single

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,380
silo with WordPress a lot of people

00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:44,370
attempt to replicate that for profit

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,380
motives to mature the core of WordPress

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,260
is open source software and you have a

00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,240
lot of open source and plugins some

00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,220
plugins are for free some of them you

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,929
pay for some people make their living

00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:59,909
off the plugins so there's still some

00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:01,440
balance that kind of sits through

00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:05,460
yeah the open source without a doubt

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:09,480
yeah and obviously a project like

00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:12,510
WordPress is partially helped out by a

00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,370
company like automatic or a project like

00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,590
Drupal is helped out by a company like

00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:20,549
acquaint so but that was a decision by

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:22,890
the developer to make the core open

00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:24,570
source and then add-on products you know

00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,909
free and then if you want this

00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,830
functionality you get a subscription for

00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:31,470
this extra functionality within this

00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:34,230
plug-in that's pretty classic that goes

00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,000
back yeah many many years yeah and you

00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,830
could have other analogies in numerous

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,039
other industries outside of software in

00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:43,039
the web and the Internet without a doubt

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:49,490
other questions other thoughts yes

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,480
Soylent Green yes it's not like green

00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,310
not so much

00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,450
we have no strong opinion on that I

00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,450
think I think you're on your own

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:13,230
but today in Silicon Valley Soylent is

00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,960
is it drives development the new Soylent

00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:20,430
products have you seen those yeah tell

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:22,830
me this guy lives off of Soylent it's a

00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:24,180
and that's what he calls it it's a drink

00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,040
that he drink three times a day

00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:29,850
a lot of developers and Silicon Valley

00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,290
live off of it you know what people yeah

00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,300
it's not right of people oh it's like

00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,910
it's like monster or something no no

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:41,880
it's it's there's multiple products

00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:43,800
within the product silver so it is made

00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:48,810
of people oh it tastes like it tastes

00:34:43,800 --> 00:35:01,590
like it's made of people any questions

00:34:48,810 --> 00:35:06,480
thoughts yeah or one day what would be

00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:20,610
the first thing you did change fix

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:21,840
Gutenberg how do you question what if

00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:25,530
you were good Lord God we would oppress

00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:27,540
for one day no religious affiliation I

00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:32,840
would say that I have worked with a lot

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,840
of artists over the years mixed media

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:39,900
performance artists writers all kinds of

00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,960
painters and whatnot and working with an

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,460
artist as a person that provides

00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,190
services through WordPress or a lot of

00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,920
other environments the artists see the

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:52,110
world in a different way but it's a good

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,030
perspective because

00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,410
it can be so different but it can give

00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,140
us insight and that's what you've done

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:06,880
today and I really appreciate it thank

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:10,680
you hope you've been enjoying WordCamp

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,680
