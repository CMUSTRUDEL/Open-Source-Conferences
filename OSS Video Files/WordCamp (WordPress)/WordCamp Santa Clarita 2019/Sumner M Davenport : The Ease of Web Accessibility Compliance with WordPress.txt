Title: Sumner M Davenport : The Ease of Web Accessibility Compliance with WordPress
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	Web Accessibility gives your clients and their clients full and equal enjoyment of their website for gaining information and purchasing products and services.
With the increased media attention on websites that are not compliant with Web Accessibility, and the opportunistic trolls that target small business, it is important for Web designers and developers to understand the WHO should comply, WHAT is and WHY of Web Accessibility, WHEN should you start with Accessibility plus HOW to talk to your clients about Accessibility and the VALUE it adds to your services and reputation.
In this presentation, Sumner M Davenport will cover:
– What difference does it make to be/not be Accessible;
– Recent cases in the news;
– Troll activity against small businesses and how to protect yourself from being a target;
– Ease of adding code, and/or use of Plugins;
– Testing tools; and
– Value added to your Web Design business

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,849
thank you very much I am so excited to

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,220
be here but before I get into the great

00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:24,810
love affair between accessibility in

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,109
WordPress I'd really like to know who my

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,560
audience is today so how many people are

00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:32,940
new to WordPress you're just beginners

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,620
awesome how many people consider

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,190
yourself an intermediate to build sites

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,910
for clients great and how many people in

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:46,379
the room know more than me I knew I'd

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,030
get one so on the next topic how many

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,190
people are familiar with web

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,520
accessibility have heard about it know

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,750
it exists oh I love that how many people

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,820
have not a clue how to implement it

00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,260
don't have a clue I love it well that

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,600
means I have something for everybody in

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,020
the room I've been designing websites

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,759
since 1997 and when I first started

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,330
working with websites I have to tell you

00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:15,360
they were the all-time ugliest websites

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,670
you can possibly imagine I admit it but

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,590
at the time in 1997 what did we have to

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:25,140
work with nice exactly not a lot but

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,850
over the years we changed we got new

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,280
tools we got new software and then

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,869
suddenly WordPress was on the market and

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,900
I discovered WordPress and fell in love

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,930
and started to convert all my old sites

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,210
to WordPress loved it then through the

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,409
years of working with it my niche market

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,180
are attorneys and suddenly I realized by

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,340
attending some of their training courses

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,950
that there are laws that pertain to

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,229
websites that many of us didn't know

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,799
that and I started to become very

00:01:52,229 --> 00:02:00,840
educated on what those laws were I have

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,070
a personal passion for accessibility it

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,860
affects my life personally and

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,399
professionally so when I discovered what

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,940
was the entire world of accessibility

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,680
with websites I dove in headfirst I

00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,829
spend at least two-thirds of my day and

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,410
my week either studying working on it

00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:23,410
talking to people asking questions or

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:26,560
remediated sites so it is my priority

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,840
I love it I'm really in love with it and

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,240
I hope that at the end of the 40 minutes

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,040
that we share together today you might

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,390
get a good like for it and maybe kind of

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,590
head your way towards a little bit of

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:43,480
love yourself I recently attended a

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,500
accessibility technology conference that

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,450
was put on by CSUN in Anaheim and there

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,850
were some awesome speakers that were

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,350
talking about accessibility as well as

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,200
legal issues and I will share some of

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,850
the things I learned that week but one

00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,590
of the things that I learned that day

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,710
one day that I was there that was a

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,060
little disturbing a particular company

00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,270
that has a tool that tests for

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:11,260
accessibility tested 1 million home

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:13,210
pages across the world how many of those

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,550
home pages do you believe a

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:21,300
percentage-wise were accessible to

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:25,750
persons with disabilities I'm hearing

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:29,410
23% anybody else have a guess 0

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,959
well between 0 and 3 it was 2% of all

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,910
the websites that they tested we're

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,370
accessible to persons with a visual

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,630
disability a hearing disability a

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:48,220
cognitive disability a motor disability

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:50,800
2% worldwide and that market area 2%

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,470
doesn't seem like a lot but yet when you

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,190
look at the whole picture it's a lot

00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:00,970
it's a lot the definition of a

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:04,000
disability is defined by the American

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,560
Association of disabilities they say the

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,570
a da defines a person with a disability

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,580
as a person who has a physical or mental

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,190
impairment that substantially limits one

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,350
or more of their life activity and a

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,720
disability sometimes we can see it we

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,820
can see someone with a wheelchair we can

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,640
see someone with a white cane or a sight

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,260
assisted dog we can see someone that has

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,330
someone that is giving them assistance

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,880
for whatever it is but we can't see them

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,750
all one out of every five person has a

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,479
disability

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,310
it's either hereditary or somewhere in

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:37,530
their life they've had an accident or an

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:40,120
injury that has caused it or it's age

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,790
so if one in five persons have a

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,710
disability we have a target market of

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,570
almost 20 percent or greater than twenty

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,420
percent of persons that we're not able

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,400
to reach that cannot use our products

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,130
and services because they cannot access

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,170
our websites so today I want to talk

00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:02,280
about what is your motivation to want to

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:04,960
fix your website is it the stick

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,210
lawsuits against businesses with the

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,430
websites that are not accessible is

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:14,110
rising at a rate of almost 200 percent

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:17,380
per week there used to be as few as two

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:21,490
hundred lawsuits in a year in 1985 there

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:25,930
were almost three that excuse me 1985

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:29,980
there were 1,800 last year 2018 there

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,440
were over 3,800 recently I'd say it was

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,270
maybe four to six weeks ago a restaurant

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,070
in downtown Los Angeles got hit with a

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,650
lawsuit because a customer went to her

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:42,190
website and couldn't access the website

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,230
and filed a case against her she was on

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,180
NBC 4 News if you google it you will see

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,240
her interview and in her interview she

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,280
said well if I'd have only known I would

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,140
have done whatever we could to make it

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,900
work for this person nobody warned me I

00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,030
had no warning you might have heard last

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,440
year even when people said oh you know

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,380
what they're sending letters out fix

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,580
your website or else a nice threat well

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,870
we have since learned from defense

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,580
attorneys that they're not sending those

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,780
letters anymore they're going straight

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,240
to court so you get no warning until you

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,550
see someone at your door the tendon you

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,410
velocity so we have two reasons to want

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,640
to be accessible one is because you

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,860
don't want to be sued you don't want

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,290
your clients to be sued and speaking to

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,060
the defense attorneys that I met in the

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,060
last three weeks at these various

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,410
conferences that I attended they said

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:36,610
the cost of a lawsuit is so expensive

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:43,080
especially in California that it is so

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:46,510
much more easier wiser smarter efficient

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,210
to fix it ahead of time or do we want to

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,410
go for the carrot to increase the value

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,780
that's why we have a picture of somebody

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,639
with thumbs up because I'd like to see

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,319
that web designers web developers

00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,180
anybody that develops an app

00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,910
anybody that develops a theme or a

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,360
plugin to make it accessible increase

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,550
value there are laws that protect

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,830
persons with disabilities the ad a

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,860
covers that you cannot discriminate

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,509
against someone with a disability in

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,780
California we have what are called the

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,509
Unruh Civil Rights Act these lawsuits

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm being told are being filed under

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:26,930
both of these and in California I'm told

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:31,520
the Unruh Civil Rights Act starts with a

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:34,729
minimum fine of $4,000 non-negotiable

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,250
now I am NOT an attorney so I can't give

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:38,750
you legal advice on any of this I can

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,440
only share with you what these attorneys

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,659
have told me and I hope that by sharing

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,310
that advice first off it saves you the

00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:48,770
cost of having to retain them to answer

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:52,030
your questions you can see that there is

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:55,699
an active legal presence in the field as

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:58,099
these lawsuits continue more and more

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,440
defense attorneys get involved and what

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:03,560
I learned when speaking to these defense

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,199
attorneys is very simple the cost of a

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,990
lawsuit is extremely expensive the cost

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,969
of a lawsuit can put you out of business

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,840
and defending against these lawsuits

00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:18,050
it's really tough

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,000
they will settle most of them instead of

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,599
going to court but even a settlement

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,150
amount could close your doors so rather

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,360
than wait until you do get caught why

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,550
not be proactive and take yourself out

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,829
of the crosshairs that is my position I

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,630
used to speak and still do to

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:37,130
conferences of business owners I need to

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,050
talk to them about the accessibility of

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,610
their website and then they would go

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,820
home and yell at their designer but I

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,100
thought I'm doing this backwards I need

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,560
to go to the designers and say hey guys

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,140
here's a way to increase your value and

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,329
make your clients happy so that they're

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,890
not in the crosshairs separate yourself

00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:58,040
from the people who are doing their

00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,870
website for 150 dollars increase your

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,630
value to them show them how much you

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,110
know make yourself a valuable asset to

00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,310
them so that is my position

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,500
increase your value when you increase

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,660
your value not only does that mean that

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,699
it will drive innovation we have more

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,829
plugins coming out for accessibility we

00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:18,320
have themes that are coming out that are

00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:21,290
already accessible in fact WordPress has

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,680
an entire focus on any new themes in

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,720
their repository need to be accessible

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,519
pretty nice they're on board we also

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,410
know that it will enhance your brand if

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,480
you can tell your client to prospective

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,759
clients that you will build their site

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,769
according to accessibility and the great

00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:41,120
part about that is if we have so many

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:43,339
people that are functioning fabulously

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,839
with their disability but they can't

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,240
access your website you're missing out

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,610
on a niche market and so is your client

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,230
so does your client know that if a blind

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,730
person wants to buy their products but

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,319
if they can't access their website they

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,610
lost a sale they don't know but wouldn't

00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:02,350
it be great if they suddenly were able

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,490
to get those clients also when you have

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,680
accessibility in your tool kit in your

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,660
building websites for your clients that

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,899
are accessible then persons with

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,060
disabilities can refer to you so now you

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,829
will have a new bank of clients that are

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,319
looking for someone who can build a

00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:20,899
website that they personally can use and

00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:23,180
they can feel very comfortable having

00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,220
their friends and their clients use it

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,889
as well so you extend your target market

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:32,139
as well by doing that and you will

00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:32,139
obviously minimize your legal risk

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:42,380
moving along this is one of the websites

00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,779
that at the end of today I will have a

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,939
URL that you may visit that will have a

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,040
link to every resource that I mentioned

00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:52,269
today but this is one that I want you to

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,250
know this is making the web accessible

00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:58,149
with the web accessibility initiative

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:03,500
this is where if you have heard about

00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:05,600
week AG WK 2.0 2.1 the content

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,319
accessibility guidelines this is where

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,360
it comes from when you start here you

00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:14,329
can educate yourself as to while this

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,550
started who are these people that are

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:17,059
coming up with the success criteria

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,409
who

00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:20,689
are these people and how can you learn

00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:22,639
from them they have tutorials they have

00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:25,399
educational materials they have examples

00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,079
they have testing tools this is where I

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,089
always recommend when someone is looking

00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:34,119
to educate themselves this is the place

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:36,379
to start it is a vast area of knowledge

00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:38,419
when you start going through what it

00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,219
takes to make the success criteria of

00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:42,279
your website made accessible I know

00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:44,839
people have gone to the guidelines and

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,549
completely overwhelmed themselves there

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,139
are pages and pages and pages and pages

00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:49,519
and what is a text font and what is the

00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,999
color contrast and what difference does

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,289
my hyperlink make it can be overwhelming

00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,869
because you're looking at the entire

00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:59,359
thing all at once today I want to give

00:11:56,869 --> 00:12:02,329
you some tidbits on some basics and show

00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,609
you how simple they are and then when

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:07,099
you go back to the guidelines then you

00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:10,099
can see oh that fits I understand that

00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:12,079
that's where that applies and that's my

00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:13,759
purpose today is to show you that in

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,399
order to build a site from accessibility

00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,349
it's easy to begin that way but if you

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,159
have sites that don't have it it's easy

00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:23,839
to remediate them when you first were

00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,569
introduced to WordPress you had to learn

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,159
it yes and the first time you went and

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:29,929
got a theme you had to learn how to work

00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,599
with that theme in WordPress yes and

00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,979
then there was a plug-in or then there

00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:36,529
was something else you were adding to it

00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:38,629
so every point in there your business

00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:40,279
progress you've learned something so

00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,679
this is an opportunity to learn

00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,839
something else instead of making it

00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,299
overwhelming it can be very fun and it

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:52,069
can be great and I suggest we start with

00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:54,469
a strategy when we have a website that

00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:56,239
we are building or if we receive one

00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:58,639
from a defense attorney and our job is

00:12:56,239 --> 00:13:00,979
to remediate it the first thing we do is

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,019
determine what is our goal when you are

00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:04,699
talking to a client about their website

00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,219
their goal usually is give me a great

00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,519
website I want everybody to know where I

00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,989
am

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:15,519
I want everybody to know what I do and

00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:19,459
you take that goal and you work with it

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,199
when we have a goal our goal is we want

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:23,389
to give the client exactly what they

00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,209
want and we want a hundred percent

00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:28,669
accessibility because we believe that a

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,210
website is more than a pretty face it

00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:32,730
has to be functional

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,399
it has to load fast it has to have good

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:39,750
SEO it has to appeal to the target

00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:42,570
market you want a low bounce rate and we

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,970
want accessibility the great part about

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,430
accessibility is that when you build it

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,770
into your toolbox it becomes so second

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,440
nature it's not something that you have

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,589
to think much about it almost becomes

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,570
the first thing you think about the

00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,580
tasks when we have a website are we

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,660
going to audit it or design it obviously

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,670
there's a difference in the approach

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,130
that we have when we do that and then we

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,260
decide when we start are we testing or

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,020
are we remediating every website that we

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,300
work on we test immediately when we

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,610
install a fresh WordPress we test it

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:18,149
WordPress out-of-the-box is almost

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,339
completely accessible and if I choose a

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,399
theme that is in the repository in the

00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,290
accessibility section and add it we're

00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,089
going to test it again we're still going

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,430
to make sure that before we put one

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,899
letter of content or one image that

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,270
we're starting with a platform of

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,310
accessibility on the other hand if we

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,680
were remediated in a website we need to

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,010
run a test on it to find out where it

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,779
needs additional assistance so in the

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,120
beginning this is where we start and

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,010
then we prioritize what's most important

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,529
first what do we need to fix first

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,959
what can wait till second what can we

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,610
wait till third what resources are we

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,830
working with you will all have different

00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,860
resources some of them I will show you

00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,330
at the end different services that you

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,000
can use different tools that you can use

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,470
but you have your own resources you want

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,360
to know what those are when you're

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,970
working with sites how are you going to

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,230
measure that you are moving forward I'm

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,000
sure you already have a measurement

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,410
program when you're building a client

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,940
site how are you going to add

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,820
accessibility into that measurement in

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,820
what are your benchmarks so we always

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,140
start with a plan so that we don't get

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,250
lost in the middle and go did we cover

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,459
that did we do that

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,290
do we fix that we start with a plan with

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,060
a checklist and go check by check by

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,190
check by check so that we're able to

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,149
know that we've made it easy to fix them

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:38,700
one by one by one there are automatic

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,140
testers on the market and I will start

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,180
by letting you know that there is not a

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,950
single automatic tester on the market

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,010
that is going to say the exact

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:51,089
thing as the other ones they each have

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:53,160
their own protocol we use the wave tool

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:57,510
it is both an online and a browser

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,670
add-on and we love the Microsoft X that

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,889
was introduced three weeks ago it is a

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,949
partnership between Microsoft and aq if

00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:08,670
you were using the ax plug-in previously

00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:11,160
this is a combination of both we love it

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,959
we also do a lot with the a inspector

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,339
which is a Firefox add-on it was

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,000
developed by the University of Illinois

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,860
and we also loved it the reason we love

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,339
the wave we show it to clients is

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,019
because all the colors and this

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,029
particular report was run on the same

00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:29,040
website by the way so where wave says

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,790
there's only two red flags and 18

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,220
contrast errs if you look down here our

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:40,560
automated tool says that there are 18

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:42,899
failures on that same page so we don't

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,870
want to rely on one tool we want to rely

00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:48,510
on as much information as we possibly

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,610
can the great thing that I like about

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:53,220
the accessibility insights for the web

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,600
if you can see on this screen if not

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,699
you'll be able to see on the slides

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,220
which you will have a link to all of

00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,660
these slides it says down here I don't

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,610
know if this has a point

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,439
nope it doesn't some a stand in the

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,510
light down here it tells us that the

00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,579
color contrast the elements have

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,579
insufficient color contrast and it tells

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,410
you the W CAG number to go look at so

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,949
you don't have to guess well what's

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,589
wrong with it

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,760
and what do I have to do to fix it it's

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,280
not only telling you what it's

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,980
identified it's telling you where you

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,620
can find the solution so it's helping

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,660
you see and learn at the same time what

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,730
we have learned is the way of tool

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,580
sometimes says that there is a color

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,169
contrast problem when there's not I have

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,270
not yet discovered that with the

00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:38,820
accessibility insights but if you have a

00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,770
background color in your website and

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,750
then you put a module on top of that

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,120
let's say you have a dark background

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,830
you put a module with a transparent

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,860
background and then you put an image on

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,630
top of that the wave tool will say oh

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,610
excuse me and then you want to put text

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,500
on top of the image the wave tool will

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,840
measure that text against the background

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:02,070
of the site not the background of

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,840
module so we had a number of them we had

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,580
a number of them that were failing white

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,100
text against a white background and we

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,020
couldn't figure this out so I sent an

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,970
email to the developers with wave it's

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,309
way its web a I am and I said I don't

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,470
understand can you please go to this

00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,929
site and tell me what it is I'm seeing

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,730
and that's when he said you know we

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:24,330
don't see the transparent background our

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,730
tool says transparent is white so the

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,580
tools are not always 100% correct you

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,070
need to manually look at what it's

00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,600
telling you I like all of the colors

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,250
when I show a client because they

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,100
respond to the colors they don't have a

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,820
clue what all these things mean but we

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,649
do the biggest failures we see we're

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,510
going to see on accessibility insights

00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:47,669
are just exactly what they're naming the

00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,039
color contrast the name of a link and a

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:53,100
unique landmark those are very common

00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,870
errors and most people either are aware

00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:00,240
of um oh don't know how to fix them and

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:02,159
they tell you a link to the answer on

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,809
our priority list

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,510
we don't go okay we got to fix all three

00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:09,809
of these right now we take them one at a

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:13,289
time so don't overwhelm yourself trying

00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:15,899
to fix everything immediately one at a

00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:18,090
time start remediating become very

00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:21,059
comfortable and if you build a similar

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,860
site for each of your clients you use

00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,779
the same theme perhaps or a similar

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,710
theme the same plugins a similar layout

00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:30,149
if you remediate one client site then

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,070
it's very easy to go to the rest of your

00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:34,890
clients and do the same thing because

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:39,419
you have just shown yourself how you can

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:41,909
make your efforts better after you test

00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,720
with the automated tools this is

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:47,309
critical these are your screen readers a

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,890
person that is blind cannot see the

00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,140
screen I have a family member that

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,390
cannot see the screen of a website I

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,620
don't care if you hold it up here even

00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,390
though she wears glasses that are very

00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,210
thick she cannot she uses a screen

00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,580
reader these are all free the one in the

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,539
middle is Apple the other two jaws and

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:09,450
NVDA are downloads that will work off of

00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:11,280
your PC I would suggest if you've never

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,610
heard one or seen one to download it

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,309
it's

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:17,159
and run it but before you do make sure

00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:19,470
you know how to turn it off because it's

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:20,940
default it's very loud and very fast so

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,739
you want to know wears off wears off

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,470
wears off because it will show you how

00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:27,379
they read a webpage and why some of

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,899
these things that we asked for are

00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:33,239
important because we a person that has

00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:34,769
no visual impairment no visual

00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:36,330
disability is going to look at a website

00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:38,100
and we kind of glance at what we're

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,350
looking for and we pinpoint what we want

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,330
we're able to see the differences in the

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,460
color and the pictures and and the

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,489
content and the fact we have no problem

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,909
with that but the reader it doesn't it

00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:52,830
goes one word at a time or with the tab

00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:55,139
it will go from one heading to a

00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,659
hyperlink to a heading to a navigation

00:20:55,139 --> 00:21:00,359
whatever they are looking for so it's a

00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:02,539
little different than what an

00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:06,509
able-bodied person is accustomed to so

00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:08,519
after you run the wave tool or the

00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:10,859
accessibility tool or whatever tool you

00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,049
use automated you will do yourself a

00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:15,749
great service if you run one of these

00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,820
tools and see what it really sounds like

00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:21,509
what does your website really present as

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:24,840
to a person who is using a screen reader

00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:26,789
and just like those of us who have very

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,259
little patience we go to a website we

00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,539
kind of skim it if it's not what we want

00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,489
we're gone they're going to do the same

00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,019
thing with a screen reader if they start

00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:36,210
at your website and it's not making any

00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,580
sense they're out of there if they can't

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,570
get the information that they want

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,480
they're gone they're going to bounce

00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,340
rate there goes your potential client

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,460
and it also goes the same for persons

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:50,489
that have a hearing disability they have

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,889
Braille readers they have readers that

00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:54,629
will let them see the content they will

00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:57,779
have larger captions there are other

00:21:54,629 --> 00:22:02,190
tools that they're able to then perceive

00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:04,259
your website if we look at what are the

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,139
four dynamics of building an awesome

00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:09,029
website and what I'm saying awesome this

00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:11,279
means that it print it's for everybody

00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:13,379
accessibility is not making things

00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,929
better for some people at the expense of

00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:18,480
others it is not putting effort in to

00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:19,350
make one group of people more special

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,570
than another group of people

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,640
accessibility levels the playing field

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,070
so everyone can come play every

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,470
one can access your website that's what

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,140
it is so if you follow the peel you are

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,980
your website is going to be better for

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,660
everyone and when we look at what P

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,070
perceivable the information is something

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,540
that a person can look at and whether

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,090
they're a visual person or using a

00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,920
reader they can perceive it vo it's

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,210
operable that means that they can use

00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,430
their readers to get through your

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,990
website or if a person does have the

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,760
capability of their mouths or their

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:55,930
keyboard they can use that as well it's

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,730
not limiting understandable is the

00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,960
content in a position a way that it's

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,610
understandable have you built the

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,360
structure in a way that's understandable

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:06,640
both to persons with the visual ability

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,010
and those that are using readers and is

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,290
it robust can it be interpreted by a

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,290
wide variety of equipment so that's not

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:17,140
just those that have no disability but

00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:19,990
those that do have any disability and

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:25,360
it's not that difficult we have three

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:28,990
success criteria a is standard when the

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,410
W keg came out it was first at a level

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,330
that if you met a you're a great then it

00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,760
was upgraded to where if it came to an

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:41,260
AAA we had a little bit more information

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:44,230
that was placed into the WCAG the week

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,390
egg so now as of the 2.1 release last

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,390
year by doing certain other things you

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:52,660
can get a triple-a rating do you need

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:56,230
them is it important between an A or a

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,590
Triple A the difference is is your

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:03,370
website accessible and how accessible is

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:06,130
it if you are selling websites to the

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,870
government or you are selling a product

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:11,230
that is going to be sold to the

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:15,900
government you must by law comply with

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:18,490
section 508 508 you want to get a a

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,820
minimum and now they're asking for

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,770
Triple A and a lot of the section 508

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,890
requirements that the federal government

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:31,300
has been required to comply with for the

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:34,980
all these years are now part of WK 2.1

00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,980
that's our triple-a yes

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:54,309
so we do mental health okay honey

00:24:47,770 --> 00:25:00,460
but it is a non-profit how would this

00:24:54,309 --> 00:25:02,440
fall into now mental health thank God

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,590
you know chance is very unlikely that

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,510
our typical use cases can access the

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,870
website it's getting more cárdenas

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,870
because

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,299
it's a very good question and I have to

00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,759
answer start by saying I'm not an

00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:21,870
attorney however what I have been told

00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,970
by attorneys who are involved in the

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,759
section 508 and a DA and web

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,039
accessibility if they are getting

00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:32,750
federal funding is not necessarily mean

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,750
that it's a requirement that they're 508

00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:39,450
that would tell them that they have to

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,409
comply with 508 you would have to ask

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:46,379
them are they in that section of

00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:49,440
government supported organizations that

00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:52,200
are required to follow section 508 they

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,059
would know that because they are given

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,399
that information if they're given

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,139
federal funds they're told what those

00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:59,970
federal funds can and cannot be is for

00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,509
and what they have to do to qualify for

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:08,190
them so it would be in that information

00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:09,720
yes it is it's always been a double a

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,440
and most parts of it have been Triple A

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,200
and now we have WK 2.1 a lot of the new

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,080
points or Triple A so section 508 has

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,860
always been more stringent because it's

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:26,639
the federal government so if you are

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,440
dealing with a federal organization then

00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:32,370
you want to really know your 508 and

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,320
it's very specific and it says things

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,610
that I will go over the difference in

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,620
just a second in a couple of things that

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:41,039
we used to think we're okay that in 508

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,929
weren't okay this is an accessibility

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,419
checklist that makes it really easy to

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:47,909
know P o you are if you want it to be

00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:49,919
perceivable here is your four points

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:50,820
guidelines for your text your time based

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,379
you're adaptable and you're

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,230
distinguishable it tells you exactly

00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:56,879
which numbers they are if you want it to

00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,320
be operable you wanted to be keyboard

00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,909
accessible you want to have enough time

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,350
for them to fill out forms you want to

00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,639
make sure that you don't have animation

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,860
that is flashing at a rate that could

00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:06,149
cause a seizure and you need to make

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,120
sure that it's navigatable by the

00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:10,740
keyboard or by the tab you also want to

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,360
know under understandable is it readable

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,509
predictable and can it use input

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,820
assistance and robust it's compatible

00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:20,039
but these are the numbers that tell you

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,929
if you want to be loved away then follow

00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,909
what it says in the yellow column if you

00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:25,240
want to be level AAA it has been

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,650
upgraded to add more info

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,050
Meishan which you'll see in the gray and

00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:37,090
Louisville truly is the green so if you

00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:40,390
only did this you are miles ahead of a

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:42,100
lot of other people and the great thing

00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,520
about it is when you start working with

00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:50,290
accessibility on your website your SEO

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:52,120
gets better when you start working with

00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,330
accessibility you may find that your

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,320
design begins to look better because

00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:02,320
there's certain things you're going to

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:05,380
do differently so because we're working

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,530
in WordPress I know a number of people

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:13,930
say well shoot I will just install a

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:15,520
plug-in we're good to go yes I know the

00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:18,760
good part is is because it's WordPress

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,820
there are plugins and these plugins will

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,360
do a lot but they will not do a hundred

00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,980
percent the bad part is so many people

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,570
rely upon the plug-in to do everything

00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,120
and yet there's so many parts that the

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,970
plug-in did not do and they don't take

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,500
the time to look and see what those are

00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,500
and the ugly part of plugins is that

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,270
some can break your site we use the

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,910
particular plug-in for years we loved it

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:45,400
it was great and then the developers

00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,650
stopped upgrading it well we know

00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,930
WordPress WordPress updates themes

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:52,540
update other plugins update and now this

00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:55,710
plug-in crashes sites we're hoping it

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,300
comes back around because we liked it

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,880
the other thing that I've seen people do

00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,830
is they will install a plug-in and say

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,050
ok I've done everything the plug-in

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,400
needs to do but they don't fill out the

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,020
specifics in the settings

00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,600
they just install the plug-in and they

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:13,630
activate it I wonder why it's not

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,460
working there are settings in every

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:18,120
plug-in a couple of the settings that

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,560
are important where is your main content

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,780
because someone using a screen reader or

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,180
a keyboard is wanting to find the main

00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,610
content of your website but if you're

00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,700
using a theme that says main content is

00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:33,220
main but you didn't set it in the

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,900
plug-in is main the plug-in may look for

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:39,000
main content or main - content

00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,010
same with navigation what is your theme

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,309
call your upper navigation versus your

00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:47,010
inline navigation and put those in the

00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:49,650
settings of the plug-in so that it

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:53,010
speaks to your theme so go beyond just

00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:55,260
installing it see which one myself and

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,210
my team we test every plugin that we

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,760
find that says that it's accessible or

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:03,390
that it creates accessibility some of

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,430
them even cost money and we will still

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,440
test it to see if it is doing what they

00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,240
are saying it will do and what I find

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,330
amusing and interesting and kind of

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,890
confusing is I get these referrals to

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,480
plugins that are supposed to create a

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,100
hundred percent accessibility and they

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,110
guarantee it and I go to their sales

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,890
page and their sales page is not

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:24,330
accessible it fails miserably and to

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,850
that I know I've I've written to them

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,920
and said I don't get it if your plug-in

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,110
is that awesome how come your page fails

00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,550
oh we haven't we haven't done our

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,490
homepage yet we haven't fixed that yet

00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:37,620
but the plug-in is great so if your

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:42,480
plugin is great how come you did it use

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:44,190
it on your own site just a question but

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,160
the plugins that we use we have a couple

00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,710
that we're testing now and we've some

00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,790
bugs we make sure to tell the developer

00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,320
this is not working

00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,600
can you explain did we do something

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,600
wrong or is this a bug because we want

00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,990
it to work so I can't tell you what

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,340
plug-in will work with your particular

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:05,280
installation of WordPress your theme and

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,809
your plugins you need to experiment we

00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,970
do however always start with the

00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:10,950
WordPress accessibility plugin after all

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,929
it's WordPress why not start there

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,390
and then we look to see what's missing

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:17,790
if we're using a theme that has its own

00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,460
accessibility plug-in we may or may not

00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:23,070
add that we know one theme that their

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,670
accessibility is great except that it

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:28,260
breaks the search feature so we've been

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,910
having talks with the developer to say

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,130
how come it breaks my search form I

00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:34,679
can't use my search form with the

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,059
plug-in installed they wouldn't know to

00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,370
fix that if someone didn't tell them

00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,870
they wouldn't even know what other

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,940
people are doing with it unless we tell

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,030
them so it's important to get feedback a

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,620
lot it there's two or three themes that

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:49,560
I know of that do have accessibility

00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,730
plugins that developers have worked on

00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:55,380
for that special

00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:57,870
the theme and contact forms many of this

00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,150
contact forms built into themes are not

00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,250
accessible they do not identify the

00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,540
actual field it looks like it to you

00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,280
when you're looking at the website it

00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,919
says name address phone number whatever

00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,990
but in the code that field is not

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,799
identified so the reader doesn't know

00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:15,360
what am I supposed to do with this spot

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,760
contact form 7 and gravity forums both

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,380
have accessibility plugins but if you

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,480
add them after you've installed either

00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,530
one of those you have to redo your forms

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,580
but at least the forms are then

00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:31,799
accessible so you look at what are you

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,290
using and what plays well with what you

00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:38,910
use and go for the simplest way possible

00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,679
what you don't want to do and I had

00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,970
someone in one of my workshops told me

00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,610
they did this they thought it was really

00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,660
smart is they took an accessibility logo

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,950
and they threw it up in the upper

00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,360
navigation of the site and they said

00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,770
well since I have an accessibility logo

00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,450
up there that means that somebody will

00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:55,710
just go to the site and they'll see that

00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:57,059
it's okay so they won't sue me I said

00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,799
well it kind of reminds me of my son

00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,929
when I walked in his room and he had

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,190
stuff all over the floor all over the

00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:03,960
bed and I said I need you to clean up

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,570
your room this is a mess get this stuff

00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,919
off the floor and I walked in about 20

00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,169
minutes later and everything was off the

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,480
floor but he was on his bed and he just

00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,580
covered it up with a blanket

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,230
he gave the illusion that he followed

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:23,480
the instructions but it wasn't done so

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:27,840
that trick does not work so don't try it

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,400
the most common thing missing and I'm

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,400
sure you've heard this over and over

00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,549
again alt tags give your images a name

00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,200
but don't say that it's an image or a

00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:40,650
logo

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,960
give it more give it robust so if it is

00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:45,990
an image what is it an image of describe

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,090
what it is give an intent what is it

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,730
doing in the content if I was using best

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:53,940
practice this is a logo and it's only

00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:57,630
used in the header or the footer of the

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:59,220
page so the alt tag on that would be the

00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,659
name of the company and it's a logo it

00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,490
doesn't really need much more than that

00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,750
because no one's going to go look

00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:08,129
forward to the content because it's

00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:11,190
there but what if you had this on the

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,659
page how would you describe that if the

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,090
image didn't show what would you want

00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,460
people to know about that image and the

00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:23,179
content it's cute that there's a lost

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,179
cat and they posted a sign on a pole yes

00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:34,379
image description yes

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,330
so tells them it's going to read an

00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:38,760
image and then it says what the alt is

00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:40,560
and if you've provided a long

00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,480
description and in your media library

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,179
you can provide long descriptions when

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,190
you upload an image then if it's there

00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,560
it gives them the option to click to

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,000
hear what the long description is so if

00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,330
your description if you're writing

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,730
something comedic about sketching there

00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,590
would be one way to write an alt tag for

00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,619
this image but if you're down an animal

00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,330
site that would have a different image I

00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,640
mean a different alt description for

00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,650
that image so make the alt description

00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,830
fit the image so it becomes part of the

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,960
content of your page and even for

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,700
someone who isn't with a visual

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,050
disability if the image doesn't show

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,510
they can see what was supposed to be

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,930
there and that information is good for

00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,930
your SEO

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,450
all images have to have an alt tag

00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,460
you're correct

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,530
thank you decorative images there is a

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,120
box in your media library that you can

00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,010
click that it's decorative and the

00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,520
reason for that is if you have let's say

00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,750
a bunch of red flags or bullets or

00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,040
little decorative portions on your

00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,380
content you don't want the reader to go

00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,690
bullet content bullet content bullet

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,700
content it will go past the decorative

00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,540
point and just read the content so thank

00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:11,230
you for bringing that up

00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:12,700
I didn't hear you exactly in your media

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,000
library you would label those as

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,000
decorative

00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:22,480
if you're hand coding the image in your

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,560
description it would say alt and in

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,930
there you would put decorative aggregate

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,500
and the way that you can check that is

00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:34,300
go to your media file choose an image

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,290
market is decorative put it into a page

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,290
and see what it looks like

00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:50,560
Noren how about this one again it

00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,960
depends on the content of where this was

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,570
at we can say that it's a picture of a

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,830
sad dog with some text on it and in the

00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:59,050
long description we can actually say

00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:02,800
what the text is but it again it depends

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:04,660
what's in there here's the other way

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,340
that I see that a lot of sites fail that

00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,560
your font your spacing in your alignment

00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,210
these fonts that I have put up there are

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,610
the ones that are the most easily read

00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:15,580
by all persons those with perfect vision

00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,870
and those using a reader and the reason

00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,270
is is because look at the space between

00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:21,280
the letters you can see what the letters

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,950
are so if you're using a decorative font

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,780
then you need to be careful if the

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,760
letters have enough spacing so in two

00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,740
point one they actually went farther to

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,870
say this is what it usually looks like

00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,090
on somebody's content but in two point

00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:36,670
one they have said we would like you to

00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:38,910
put point 1 2 pixel between

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,560
we would like one and a half percent

00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:44,080
line spacing and two percent between

00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:50,560
paragraphs so that same text looks like

00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:52,450
this so anybody can read it so it's not

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,849
just we're saying oh you've got to do

00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:58,240
this for accessibility anybody can read

00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:01,150
it your structure here's where I see a

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,430
lot of people in the past we would use

00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,710
our CSS to tell us what size were our H

00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:07,750
tags and a lot of people were doing just

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:11,200
that without realizing those H tags have

00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:13,599
purpose your h1 is important what is the

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,950
title of your page and what is the most

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,810
important point on that page and

00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,970
everything that follows it so the

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:24,190
structure tells the reader to go one two

00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,780
three four five six I was talking to

00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,750
someone on the phone I ran a test on her

00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:34,270
website and she Wed H 1 H 4 H 6 H 3 H 2

00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:35,890
H 9 I went what I said why and she goes

00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,690
well cuz those are the sizes in my CSS

00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,060
file and I said I got it

00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,800
but how about if we put those in order

00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,450
so that the screen reader is not trying

00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,310
to find what's next all over the page

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,990
but can go down the page systematically

00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,470
which is why don't want to do that I

00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:52,480
said well that's your choice

00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:55,030
but that's that's my recommendation is

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,790
to understand the structure and we're

00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,619
talking about W CAG 2.4 where you can

00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:03,460
get more information about the actual

00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:07,240
structure hyperlinks they need to say

00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,440
more than click here or link and I don't

00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,780
know about you but probably all my

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,849
websites previously were designed and

00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,780
built they say click here paragraph

00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:18,550
paragraph content of content click here

00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,320
you need to add more information but you

00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,500
don't want it to be so long that it runs

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:27,760
off the page did that on purpose

00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:31,000
you want it to have content that tells

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,140
it what they're linking to link to the

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,140
article about such-and-such

00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,640
that alone makes a difference when

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,760
somebody's going through the website

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,049
with a with the jaws the screen reader

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,430
what am i clicking what it what is there

00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:46,470
is that the article is that the rest of

00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:49,230
the paragraph what's there give them

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,599
that information and make sure that it's

00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,270
visually distinctive it's readable and

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,690
it has good length and there is a 3 to 1

00:39:54,270 --> 00:40:00,780
contrast ratio between the color of your

00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:02,280
hyperlink and your text I have seen

00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,990
pages where the background is dark blue

00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:09,089
the text is white and the hyperlink is

00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:10,799
red can't see it and you also want to

00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:15,270
make sure that when you do a hover on it

00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:17,069
that that also works with color I'm

00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,690
gonna move fast cause we're running slow

00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:21,450
I mean in we're running low on time

00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:24,750
color did you know that colorblindness

00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:27,480
one in a hundred and eighty eight people

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,579
are blind one in five persons has a

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,990
disability so given the number of people

00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,839
in this room that means there's persons

00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,750
in this room that have a disability we

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,990
don't know if it's hearing visual

00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,970
cognitive motor but it's there one in 30

00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,890
people have low vision color blindness

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:47,549
one in 12 when I was dealing with a

00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,750
client here is a when you get the slide

00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:51,450
you'll be able to see the chart that

00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:53,069
that particular company has put together

00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,109
on what colors work best on what

00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:56,910
backgrounds but I was working with a

00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:58,920
client so it's not just the color of

00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,079
your font against the background

00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,109
how about colors that are close together

00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,460
like a pie chart or an infographic I was

00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:06,630
with a client and he wanted to do

00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,599
something like this and I said that's

00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:12,170
not going to work watch what happens for

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,170
a colorblind person

00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:18,109
part of our pious missing is all oh

00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:20,119
that's no big deal let's go see what

00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:21,709
other people in the company think about

00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,209
it so we took my laptop when we went

00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:25,519
into various people's offices and we

00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:26,809
walked into one man and you said don't

00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,239
worry about me I can't tell anyway I'm

00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:31,429
color blind ding ding ding ding good

00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:33,409
would you tell us and he said I don't

00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:36,349
know what's there looks like two things

00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:39,649
three things so what we did then we can

00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:41,119
put a line in there to show the

00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:43,429
difference put the numbers on those

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:49,909
colors so when we then lose the color we

00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:53,319
still have what we need and again W K

00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:56,119
one point four point one use of color

00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:58,759
captions on videos and audio files if

00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,709
you go to youtube there is on there

00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:03,709
drop-down menu the opportunity that you

00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:06,889
can get the full transcription of that

00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:09,739
video so that if you can't hear it you

00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:11,989
can read it if you're putting captions

00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:13,489
on your videos then you're let making

00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:14,809
sure that people when they're sitting in

00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,879
their offices and they have the sound

00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:18,889
off can still know what you're saying on

00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:20,749
that video but you're also making sure

00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:23,389
that people that are with a hearing

00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:25,789
disability can also know what's going on

00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:28,339
on your video or your audio file you

00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:31,249
also don't want autoplay audio and

00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:33,139
visual I have not done that for years

00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:35,119
because I know given that my attorney

00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:37,309
might niche market our attorneys if

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,659
someone at work wants to look for an

00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:39,979
attorney they certainly don't want to

00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:41,119
launch it at work and have everybody in

00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:43,399
the office know they just went to an

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,419
attorney's website and says hey you need

00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:48,949
an attorney call me so make sure that

00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:50,569
you can read up here's the various

00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:52,429
places in the W Keg but have

00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,439
transcriptions for your videos

00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:56,539
whether right on the page or a link to

00:42:54,439 --> 00:43:00,669
the page so if somebody wants to know

00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:03,229
what it is the why are your landmarks is

00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:06,009
one point three point six here's where I

00:43:03,229 --> 00:43:10,939
mentioned previously it's going to say

00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:12,709
where is your main content the area tag

00:43:10,939 --> 00:43:14,329
is the accessible rich Internet

00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:15,589
application that the screen reader is

00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:19,009
going to read and it's going to tell

00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:20,659
them where to go there are a number of

00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:23,029
accessibility plugins they will

00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:25,369
automatically add the Aria tags for you

00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:26,959
but the ones they seem to miss like a

00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,680
previously mentioned is what is your

00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:29,329
content is

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,220
called main is a called content it is a

00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:35,720
main - content what is your navigation

00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:40,460
so you want to know what it's called in

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:42,470
your theme so that you can do it and the

00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:47,000
extra benefit good area tags being great

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:49,339
SEO benefits so working with

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,050
accessibility is not to make your job

00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:52,609
more difficult it actually makes your

00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,619
job easier

00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:57,349
when you include it in what you do and

00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:58,569
it makes the end product a better

00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:00,980
product

00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:03,740
so in summary plan your design to

00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,400
include accessibility use plugins that

00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:11,869
prioritize accessibility test test test

00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,400
test test test test everything check for

00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:14,720
the obvious your fonts your structure

00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,040
your color schemes the things that I

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,770
mentioned here today are the obvious

00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,359
ones people fail there are more than

00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,280
these I couldn't possibly tell you

00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:24,410
everything about accessibility in 40

00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,530
minutes unless I talked as fast as I did

00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:29,900
last night but I'm trying not to do that

00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:33,079
today test your site sometimes without

00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,640
using your mouse use the tab key and see

00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:36,049
what it does to your site does it go

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,790
from the heading to paragraph the

00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:41,030
hyperlink did it miss something very

00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:44,000
important tested as if it was a person

00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:45,589
that couldn't use a mouse take that

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,290
extra step to see what are you

00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:50,720
presenting and think user experience

00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:52,730
I've talked a lot about the technical

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,760
parts of what you can do for your

00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:57,530
website but think about user experience

00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,109
think about the person that's accessing

00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,839
your website if you use very good alt

00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:05,000
tags that describe what that image is

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,940
that's a better user experience than

00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,380
just saying grass out a window but you

00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,970
say grass out a window and there's this

00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,859
being a sunshine that's going across

00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,660
some poppies and there's a cat laying in

00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:17,329
the grass you're creating a better user

00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,130
experience if you start to word your

00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:21,559
content instead of just saying click

00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,839
here but describe why you want someone

00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:26,809
to click that link you're providing a

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,720
user experience where someone is is more

00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:32,180
welcomed to your website and its content

00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,099
if you think about the images that you

00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:36,140
place in your content instead of just

00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:39,530
taking up space but enhancing your

00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:41,540
content then again you're creating a

00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:43,490
user experience

00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,320
so it's not all about hurry up and do

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,360
this so that you don't get sued it's

00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,630
about creating user experience and a

00:45:47,360 --> 00:46:01,610
website for more people to access did

00:45:50,630 --> 00:46:05,810
you have a question it is termed as

00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:07,610
public facing websites what I have been

00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:10,400
told by attorneys is there's not a

00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:13,480
specific law that says you as a business

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:17,210
must have an accessible website however

00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,750
if a person that cannot access your

00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:23,450
website does so and feels that you

00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,640
discriminated against them because of

00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:28,160
their disability that's where the a DA

00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:31,180
and the Unruh Civil Rights Act come into

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,770
play it falls into the discrimination

00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:36,050
what I know about the cases that I've

00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:37,790
seen in the news it doesn't make any

00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:40,280
difference the size of your business or

00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:42,650
the size of your celebrity because we

00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,020
have seen restaurants that are five page

00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:47,390
websites and a celebrity that has a

00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,270
multi-million dollar website we have

00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:52,280
seen fast-food restaurants and

00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:54,110
restaurant chains we've seen ecommerce

00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,030
sites that don't have a physical

00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:58,100
presence brick-and-mortar we've seen

00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,770
brick-and-mortar retail stores whose web

00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,570
sites are hit so it's not going to get

00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,800
you out of trouble because you don't

00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,470
have a brick-and-mortar and you only

00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,970
have a website what I'm told by the

00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:10,400
defense attorneys is that the DOJ

00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:12,050
clarified just a few years ago that a

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,530
website is the extension of your

00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:17,920
business it is your storefront another

00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,920
question

00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:28,770
you don't have to be selling your your

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,570
your content is your sales pitch this

00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:33,900
particular celebrity that I have in mind

00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:35,700
I have to say I have not visited that

00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,250
person's website so I don't know if they

00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:41,910
were selling products they could be

00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:43,860
because they are well if it's Beyonce

00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,600
so I don't know if she sells stuff on

00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,040
her website or whether she's booking for

00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,540
her tours or what her because I never

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,880
have been there I just know that she is

00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:54,380
one that a lawsuit was filed against

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,380
just a few months ago yes

00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:12,300
Jemison but that's what you do and

00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:15,680
someone visits your website and wants to

00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,680
partake in that context

00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:36,150
however here's again this is not legal

00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,250
advice I'm not an attorney what I have

00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:40,560
been told and I do ask lots of questions

00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:42,510
when I get a defense attorney that is

00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,830
defending these cases I show up with

00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:46,200
every question I've ever been asked

00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:49,140
because I want to know if you are

00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,880
someone like Beyonce makes millions of

00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,960
dollars off of the people who come to

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,580
her events and her products and such and

00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,950
possibly after that so like I said I've

00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,230
never been there the person that is

00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:02,790
suing her it's a large organization so

00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,410
it's not just a person it is an

00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,240
organization that represents a large

00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,910
group of people their objective is to

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,040
make access for all their objective is

00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:14,000
not just to empty your pocket on the

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,260
other hand there are what are termed

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,030
opportunistic plaintiffs that go after

00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,610
people that are the small business

00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:23,430
because they know you will hurry up and

00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,840
settle and they will get some money that

00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,160
is my opinion that is what I've been

00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,720
told I can't tell you if that's an

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,310
absolute fact especially since I'm on

00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,810
video so as far as your example someone

00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:36,090
asked me a similar example last night

00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:37,650
about if he was a college student and he

00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,930
had a blog and he was just blogging

00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:42,360
would that make him a target and my

00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:43,710
response to him was I'm not an attorney

00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,050
and I can't say for sure but I would

00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,370
imagine no because you don't appear to

00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:51,620
have the money that this person would

00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:51,620
want to get from you yes

00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,590
huh

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:07,480
as long as it has the adequate space

00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:08,589
between the font and the line size test

00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,510
it and see if it works

00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:12,309
a lot of the reason for the fonts that I

00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,200
showed you is because they already come

00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,750
with that correct spacing between them

00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,210
so there are people that learn essence

00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:22,420
designer fonts on their site and great

00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:24,700
do it just test test and see if it works

00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,079
and if not make an adjustment but be

00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,760
careful of using a lot of decorative

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,559
fonts with standard fonts because then

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,130
it just crazy for the eye was there

00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,130
someone else yes

00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:52,640
well the percentage that we talked about

00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:54,320
is how many people overall our persons

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,020
with a disability whether it's visual or

00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,520
audio whether it's cognitive you can you

00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,990
can go to various sites like the

00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,119
Association for the blind and see what

00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:06,170
their percentage is you can go for the

00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:07,640
you know the various groups and see what

00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:10,730
their percentages are but as a general

00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,270
rule we talk about one in five one in

00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:13,460
five

00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:16,250
and again it's some are hereditary

00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:18,830
summer by accident and summer by age so

00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,300
just because somebody's okay today

00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:24,369
doesn't mean this afternoon that doesn't

00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:27,470
change write down this particular URL

00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:29,630
this is where a copy of these slides and

00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:33,230
all of the references that I have made

00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:36,440
to the various wk information as well as

00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,720
the testing tools the various plugins

00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:43,960
that we use that will be live by

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:47,599
tomorrow is there any other questions I

00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,560
think we're on the nose thank you so

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:55,419
much

00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:55,419
