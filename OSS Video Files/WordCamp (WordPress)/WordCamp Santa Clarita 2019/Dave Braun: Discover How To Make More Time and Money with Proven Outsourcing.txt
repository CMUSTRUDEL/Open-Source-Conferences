Are you at the point in your web business where you can use some help, or know you will be soon, yet think you can’t afford it? Think again! At some point, if you want to get a part of your life back, and actually be able to relax, sleep, and not worry so much about your business, you’ll need to delegate your work to someone else. So why not build a capable but affordable virtual team to help? Dave Braun’s presentation shows you how to get started with one or more virtual assistant as well as some great tips for making them, and yourself, as productive as possible.

pictures or anything and and while

00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:43,210
you're going through this you're gonna

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,780
write some stuff down don't write down

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:49,509
as much of what I say but write down how

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,140
it comes across to you what makes sense

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,249
to you okay because I have you as you

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,049
come out of this you can get a whole

00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:59,170
bunch of information but maybe take one

00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:02,369
or two or three things with you from the

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,369
talk alright

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,790
all right here's the overview what we're

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,920
gonna talk about true business

00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:13,120
definition what it is why you should

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,060
outsource and to whom and a process okay

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,900
now how many of you guys here are

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,790
solopreneurs alright how many guys work

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:27,700
with the team or have a team under you

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:29,230
few of you okay all right good so the

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,590
true business definition I can heard it

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,940
from Dan Locke years ago and I've

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,830
thought a lot about it the business

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,020
isn't a profitable enterprise that works

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,860
with or without you that works as well

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,950
for nonprofits okay so the key point of

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,320
this is the without if you want to build

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,240
a business you need to have it run

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,900
without you because the value of your

00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,090
business

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,150
is obviously the revenue and the profits

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,959
that brings in but to somebody buying it

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,120
it's the certainty of that revenue and

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,280
if you're if they're buying it from you

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,660
you're not going to be there okay so

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,230
it's one of the things to think about is

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,300
your solopreneur but where where do you

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,709
want how do you want to exit this

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,780
because at some point in your life

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,250
you're going to exit your business you

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,709
could close it down you could sell it

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,420
give it to your kids or whatever but if

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,890
you really want to build a business I'm

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,930
assuming most of you do that's why

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,790
you're here spending a lot of time then

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,400
you're gonna want to think about how to

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,700
get it to work pretty well you know

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,720
without you takes a long time but it can

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,790
be worth it so why outsource this is the

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,190
way you know all that marketing charts

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:43,200
and sales charts and all this stuff go

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:48,280
your business on an upward trajectory

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,739
revenue profit whatever what you expect

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,519
in the future is it's gonna keep going

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,799
up okay

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,700
that's how we plan we think we're gonna

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,470
live forever all that stuff okay now to

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,760
get it to go up here's some

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,840
possibilities you're gonna have to get

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:08,260
more clients better clients new services

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,750
new products raise pricing the thing is

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,230
though is all of those things are going

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,930
to require time or they have limits to

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,729
them for example more clients

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,280
and you can only handle so many clients

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:26,830
right raising raise pricing you can't

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,419
you it's hard to charge a hundred

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,949
thousand dollars for a website there's a

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,289
few out there that very few that you

00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,340
could do right I'm guessing most of the

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,139
people in this room are canned they

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,570
charge that I don't certainly don't

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,270
charge that so you can only raise

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,400
pricing so much

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:47,229
so the question ends up being how do you

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,800
continue to grow so we talked about your

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:53,580
business what you expect to go up but

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,930
what can happen is you get a disruption

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,110
all right especially if you're a

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,880
solopreneur on your own you get a

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:05,080
disruption what could those be well

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,720
that's my wife down here we're in an

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,599
emergency room and you know I've been

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,120
married 35 plus years you saw that one

00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:14,650
of the reasons is because I asked ahead

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,810
of time if I could do something like

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,449
this show her and it's laying in the

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,370
emergency room she said she said yeah

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:25,510
but don't count on 36 years of marriage

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,580
No so two weeks ago yesterday we were in

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,979
the emergency room room Hoke Hospital

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:36,039
Irvine she ended up having an emergency

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:38,949
appendectomy that night okay and you're

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:42,669
married you're gonna be the primary

00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:45,310
caretaker for your spouse or that could

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,229
be you okay so what's gonna happen to

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,050
your clients what's gonna happen to your

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:52,240
business if something like this happens

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,409
because it will happen at some point it

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,289
happens to everybody

00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:58,539
now they had decent Wi-Fi here I could

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,729
keep up on stuff but there's no way that

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:03,010
I could concentrate and really develop a

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:06,699
lot of a lot of you know high-level

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:11,349
sites or whatever right and I was very

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:13,060
distracted so we talked about a

00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,770
potential medical issue that could have

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,650
to be it being a disruption in your

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,880
business you want to take a vacation

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,740
right and but you still want to have the

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,270
income coming in all right you could get

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,680
burnout for a while you could say oh my

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,110
gosh I'm just so tired of all these

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,279
clients I got to take a break I don't

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,870
know if that's ever happened to any of

00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,210
you yeah there you go

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,699
happens it does happen

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,500
you could have an accident family

00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,780
requirements as my wife could be your

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,410
kids could be your elderly parents this

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,060
is something that happens or you say you

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,710
just want to volunteer you want to

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,370
volunteer and speak at a word camp

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,160
someday

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,780
all right this takes time you got it

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,259
plan your business at least you still

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,590
have income enough to handle that all

00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,780
right

00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,310
great quote by Steve Jobs great things

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,190
in business are never done by one person

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,410
they're done by a team of people so it

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,539
depends upon you do you want to do great

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,310
things with your life and with your

00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:09,490
business do you want to really make a

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,520
big difference to people in their

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,990
businesses you know you think about me

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,270
for me one of the things is when I do

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,800
some of these website and they love it

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,070
and everything they're proud of it I

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,509
mean that makes me feel good part it

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,849
partly that but the other thing is I

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,729
know that that's a 24/7 salesperson

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,800
that's right there for them hopefully

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:35,039
bringing in them in money but at least

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:37,900
giving them leads or whatever 24/7 okay

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,120
so build a team how are we going to do

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,220
this build a team fulfills the true

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,460
definite definition of a business you

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,509
build your team right you can you know

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,259
then you can take some time off

00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:52,389
all right it allows for expansion

00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:57,789
mitigates the impact of life events and

00:07:52,389 --> 00:08:01,330
it will give you a life okay question is

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,710
how how do we afford it and where are

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,030
you going to start if you're even

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,620
thinking about this because at some

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,930
point even if you're new to WordPress

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,180
you're just here for the first time ever

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,320
you're just learning you're gonna you're

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,360
gonna get to a point where you're pretty

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,270
good at it right it's not gonna take

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,800
five years plus like it took me you guys

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,380
are probably gonna do it you know a lot

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,780
quicker so you may want to you know

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,909
expand and do more serve more people

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,419
serve more clients so where you gonna

00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,680
start

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:32,529
how do you manage that team and thrive

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,589
how do you manage yourself so the

00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,820
question is what's the right process

00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:40,870
okay so a lot of stuff that I'm going to

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,909
talk about here today works with anybody

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,990
doesn't matter what part of the country

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,760
what part

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,130
the world that they're from it works

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,209
with anybody if you're hiring somebody

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,350
local from another country okay so one

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:56,410
of the things you look at this global

00:08:53,350 --> 00:09:00,850
map is these are approximate monthly

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,560
salaries of virtual assistants all of

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,410
the range of the like a general

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,750
developer etc okay so you can see us is

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,529
around fifty thousand a year four

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,310
thousand a month

00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:14,320
Australia is more it should be less

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,649
there down under right I don't know why

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,220
there's so much but then you can see the

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:23,529
different amounts India eight hundred

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,820
I've been in India a few times worked

00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:30,640
with those guys and gals very closely

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,060
it's great Philippines four hundred a

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,750
month

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,510
well can we target them in fact that's

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,730
one of the things that we do some of the

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,480
advantages of the Philippines are they

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,950
work hard they speak English really well

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,560
which is an issue on some of the other

00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:50,560
countries they're very family oriented

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,060
they they want to have some stable

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,370
income they want to be with you for a

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,579
while okay so there's some really good

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,140
advantages within and plus you think

00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:01,690
about it they're about a tenth of the

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,470
cost of what it would cost somebody here

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,570
local okay so here's a few monthly

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,940
salaries average so you see the number

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,649
there the left is kind of the average

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,050
and then there's a range obviously that

00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:18,070
range is going to be based upon their

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:22,420
expertise their experience okay so a

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:25,570
general VA 500 SEO expert 600 a verge

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:29,610
graphic designer 640 now again there's a

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:34,450
wide range web designer is that much

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:36,880
video editor copywriter and yes you can

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,600
get quality people doing all of these

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,089
things one of the ladies on our team

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,850
that works for us sometimes is she does

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:48,070
blog writing for us she's really good

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,089
and and one of the things to think about

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:56,350
too is that as you outsource to anybody

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:57,970
here wherever a lot of times it's not

00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,860
going to get to be like a hundred

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,410
percent the way you want it and that's

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,470
okay if they can get you say you know

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:08,800
90% of the way there that saves you just

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,089
a ton of time and effort okay I'll talk

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,519
a little bit about one of the big

00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:15,910
advantages that you get once you start

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,500
outsourcing where anywhere so the young

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,689
lady on the Left she's my general

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,279
virtual assistant she's been her name's

00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:25,889
Daphne she's been with me for almost

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:28,899
four years now she's she's awesome and

00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:30,310
this guy here is Brian and he's been

00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,399
with me almost three years he's my

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,529
developer he does some stuff that I

00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:40,660
can't do and I do stuff that he can't do

00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:42,370
so we're a good team so just to give you

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,649
an example of some of the things on of

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,089
Daphne's recent work here she's done

00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:51,910
site maintenance for me

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:54,579
preparing monthly reports that we have

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,139
for our clients she's and her blog post

00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,459
provided by client Dunham

00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:01,120
gotten them done out out of the way

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:03,040
she's designed sample pages for a client

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,399
as well she designs she actually does

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,740
our websites are design much better than

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,329
me she's done competitive analysis for

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,370
me right I'm thinking about offering up

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:15,279
a new service that's an important thing

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,740
if you want your new service or your new

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,600
product to be successful you need to do

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,720
a competitive analysis you need to know

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,709
what everybody's doing out there

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,319
she did she did graphics for our website

00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:33,490
she actually created this slide deck

00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:35,259
okay I don't know if you guys have ever

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,540
heard of new robot ninja every evening

00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:40,059
you guys have heard that at all okay one

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,110
guy it's a it's there's a free version

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:46,240
that gives you a pretty decent amount of

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,040
weekly testing of a WooCommerce site if

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,800
there's something that's wrong they'll

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,149
email you it's it's a nice free tool and

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,649
it costs if you want to have them do the

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:58,149
whole thing but if you're gonna have a

00:12:53,649 --> 00:13:02,920
major WooCommerce client but get the pay

00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:05,379
for it but if not even you know for

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,019
anybody just it gives you at least a

00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,670
little bit of confidence that that

00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,800
WooCommerce site is is working well

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,540
because that's a

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,040
yeah WooCommerce you got to make sure

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,480
that that's working well because if it

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,709
doesn't if there's a problem that

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,589
affects your clients income that's and

00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:27,369
that's important okay yeah when I say to

00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:28,959
actually done it twice she's tested

00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:30,220
opt-ins on our website you guys make

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,610
sure that you have those so you can

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:36,600
capture leads capture people coming in I

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,980
think there's some talks about that -

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,980
she's compared reports for a couple of

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,369
maintenance services like the reports we

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:49,269
get from wpm you or I themes sync

00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:51,160
she's compared those she's filtered

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,110
through so we have one client that we're

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,420
doing a website now for that skit they

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,999
gave us if we ask for a bunch of

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,220
pictures they gave us like 200 which is

00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:03,489
awesome it's about what do we use in the

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,720
site so I say Daphne go filter these see

00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:08,139
what you think because you did the

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,720
overall design from a graphics

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,069
perspective why don't you go through and

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,899
look at some of those pictures and tell

00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:16,420
me which ones you want then we can have

00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:18,129
the client rename them appropriately so

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,779
that when we upload them there they

00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:26,049
automatically get the alt tags for a

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:29,379
proper SEO okay all right so like I said

00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:32,019
for any VA you want to get or just

00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:33,999
anybody that you have on your team

00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:35,679
you've got to do a process of

00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,649
preparation and typically that will

00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,079
you'll go through that once then you're

00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:44,949
going to want to hire and then thrive a

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,629
lot of people end up just saying I want

00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,920
to hire somebody right I got to get

00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:51,069
somebody I know what I need I want to

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,410
get somebody they forget about how to

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:57,100
make this relationship thrive and they

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,290
forget to prepare themselves to

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,230
understand what they really really need

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:06,519
okay we're going to talk about all three

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:09,100
of those real quick all right so prepare

00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,959
a lot of that preparation is about

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,329
yourself right you want to discover your

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,899
strengths the way that you naturally

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:19,779
work and that gives you energy etc you

00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:21,279
want to discover your personality ideal

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:23,860
you create your vision in your mission

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,210
your vision is the desired end state an

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,040
example is

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,800
clean water for everybody right

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,350
something like that you know and then

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,780
creating your mission why you exist I

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,120
mean on the hundreds thousands of

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:40,200
developers and companies out there why

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,360
are you doing what you're doing right

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,810
and it's and it's really important

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,190
because once you create these things it

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,780
helps you through the tough times which

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,060
are gonna come when you don't feel like

00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,980
doing it well you know when the the

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,460
client calls and complains or whatever

00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,580
you got to go back and say why the heck

00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,760
am I still doing this stuff hopefully

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,280
that vision and mission you create is

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,270
pretty compelling for you you also want

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,280
to create your core values if you're

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,130
gonna build a team and I suggest doing

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,300
it early even before you're gonna build

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,770
your team create your core values how

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,990
how are you going to govern what you do

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,180
with your clients with yourself all

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:26,620
right once you do that then that's

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,000
that's incredibly important to create

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,230
the culture in your business so knowing

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,660
yourself and what you're trying to build

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,910
is foundational culture is critical if

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,820
you don't build it intentionally in your

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,100
business right now whoever you bring on

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,390
in the future they're gonna be the ones

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,910
that are going to create it or your

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,910
customers are gonna create it for you

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:51,550
you've got to decide what do you want in

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:52,870
your culture yes yeah all of these I'll

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:59,520
give you the link at the very end for

00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:02,500
all the slights oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,970
so for example I'm the core values that

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:09,070
I have in my business are grace

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:15,310
greatness growth grins because we like

00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:16,540
to have fun right and geez I've

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,839
forgotten them myself what's the last

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,830
one

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,330
Oh genuine then by the way I review this

00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,180
with my team every week not just for

00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:27,100
them but for me so genuine we want to be

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:32,290
genuine we want to be authentic with our

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:35,820
clients okay so here's a vision example

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,820
is this is what ours is

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,350
I drew it myself

00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,690
great book draw to win great book I'm

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:51,139
still going through it

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:54,080
so hopefully kind of get the idea a ball

00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:56,409
and chain here's a person going upstairs

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,549
for his potential

00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,019
every entrepreneur freed to unleash

00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:01,399
their true potential that's a vision

00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:04,220
that's what we want to see it's what I

00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:08,690
want to see is the CEO of my business

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,940
and so by knowing that it governs the

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,169
things that I do for example every

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,879
entrepreneur free to unleash their true

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:17,360
potential by me presenting this stuff to

00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:19,249
you guys that I'm hoping to help be able

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,129
to unleash your potential because your

00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:24,440
potential is a lot more than doing a

00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:27,110
website on your own it really is okay

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,830
and it maybe that's all you want and

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,559
that's cool

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:37,309
but you just have to decide where you

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:41,629
want to go so preparation one of the

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:45,049
best things to do is I've got my journal

00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:47,690
over there but I write down no that's

00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:49,369
okay thanks I just write down all the

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,529
stuff that I do every day check them off

00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:53,179
you know I'm a sucker for a to-do list

00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:57,019
and I like the emotional feeling of

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,249
check that off yeah it's done so were

00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,840
you write down everything that you do

00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:03,259
and you should be doing so I can go back

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,190
and look at that stuff and then you what

00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:10,669
you do is map it to the next page okay

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,169
so what that does is get you on the road

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:16,909
to developing a base requirements for

00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:18,590
getting a virtual assistant so here's

00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,980
the virtual freedom exercise template

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,950
inspired by Chris Ducker so the first

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,549
one is you write down everything I hate

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:31,639
doing or don't like to do or what drives

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,929
me nuts you guys probably have a few of

00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:35,299
that a few of those things in your

00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:36,190
business I'm gonna have to go over here

00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,409
I can't read it

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,720
so blog post formatting and I just write

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:43,909
in what I'm doing about it here does a

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,799
little bit ago so Daphne is doing that

00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:47,389
blog post picture creation and

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,110
formatting getting at the right size

00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:52,140
making it look good

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:55,500
I don't like you guys I hate social

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,480
media I just I hate it and I still have

00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,360
an issue I got to get on social media I

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,880
just got to preparing email marketing

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,250
emails she's doing she's doing that I

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,100
write it out and then she prepares it so

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,720
it looks good okay

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,220
the next column is what I don't know how

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,980
to do or can't do or things that could

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,570
be completed faster by someone else or

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,310
wrapped up better by someone else or am

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,140
i cutting costs by dabbling outside of

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,660
my expertise you guys are all smart

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,700
people I'm really smart we can all do

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,560
anything but should we do everything all

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,050
right

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,210
so graphic editing I can do okay at that

00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,180
but I'm never gonna get to be on a scale

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,260
of 0 to 10 to be a 10 there's just not

00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,960
gonna it's just not me

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,930
all right so I have Daffy doing it Java

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,020
JavaScript for whatever reason I don't

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:48,120
do well I do PHP CSS HTML is great

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,700
Facebook ad management if I want to do

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,320
that complex plugins I mean I'm okay but

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,940
it's just not the great I'm not the

00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,500
greatest so everything I feel I should

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,690
not be doing that's the third column

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,370
what do you feel like you should not be

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,030
doing I wrote down working on an hourly

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:08,490
basis all the time making sure that I do

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:11,130
service based packages and stuff check

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,410
checking and scheduling social media all

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,090
right and there's other things that I

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,220
can delegate you know my accountant work

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,370
I've done a little bit of that legal

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,230
stuff I shouldn't be like searching the

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,990
web looking for contracts all that kind

00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:27,960
of stuff just that's just silly for me

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,780
to do that so I actually have an outside

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,030
service to do that for so the idea then

00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:36,180
is so that's that's the first row the

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,620
next and your preparation time is you

00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,300
want to do you want to look at what you

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,710
want to do more of what I like to do

00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,740
what gives me energy what I do that puts

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,480
me into a zone what makes you guys

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,130
you're sitting down doing something and

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,410
you haven't gone to the bathroom for

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,390
half a day or you forgot to eat what is

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,090
what are those things that's what one of

00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,770
the things you want to do more of right

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,450
so for me I love to learn I love you

00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,190
know just general website work I love

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,809
collaborating with my team and solving a

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:07,249
problem putting our website together

00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:08,809
did it last late yesterday afternoon my

00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:11,360
Brian might develop and I we were

00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,039
together on a zoom call for four hours

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,659
dividing and conquering and just getting

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,909
it all done I do love to code certain

00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,649
areas right so what am I good at in

00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:24,409
other words what is it that I play at

00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:26,389
that other people have to work at okay

00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,620
what kind of comes naturally to me right

00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:29,990
and so I have a few things I love

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,590
systems etc recording out to videos

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,889
that's fun

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,960
right but then what I really should be

00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:37,999
doing as a business owner or in my

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,740
position that's that's a very important

00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:43,029
thing to to make sure that you have a

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,350
handle on right so as a business owner

00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:48,379
there's a big part of what you need to

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,850
do in sales and marketing doing and what

00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:51,889
I should do is come up with better

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,830
systems tracking finance and all that

00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:56,330
kind of stuff right measuring things

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:59,240
creating new and better offers products

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,279
executing ideas negotiating deals public

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,110
speaking from the owner I really should

00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:08,450
be doing that okay there's a blank

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:11,950
template that you can you can grab once

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:15,049
you get the slides okay

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,249
so then when you hire some of this is

00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:18,200
obvious right you're gonna post an

00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:20,929
application but some things aren't as

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,610
obvious is you want to filter people

00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:25,429
right you make them jump through a few

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,990
hoops okay because right especially now

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:29,419
a lot of people will look at an

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,029
application they'll just throw stuff in

00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,249
there let me give you one hint is what

00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:36,499
we did with our application our recent

00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:38,990
one is we told them at the very bottom

00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:42,710
of the application and this is where my

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:45,200
developer he had that idea Brian a very

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,200
bottom of the application we said if you

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,249
if you're interested in this put the

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:55,610
word Batman in the subject line about

00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:58,430
half of the people responded know Batman

00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,350
yeah so it's like if I'm gonna hire

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,840
somebody do I want attention to detail

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,010
they're not gonna read the whole thing

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,180
like why do I want to talk to them why

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:10,160
do I want to consider them

00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:11,870
okay so interviewing obviously going to

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,550
interview you need to do two ways right

00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,960
one is skills based and one is

00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,900
behavioral and you guys have heard of

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,460
behavioral interviewing before okay

00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,100
anybody want to say what it is if they

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,220
recall I know I'm putting you on the

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,220
spot

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:35,180
so the idea well and that's and that's

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:38,300
yeah that's part of it that's part of it

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,970
what behavioral interviewing does is it

00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,470
it's a way of predicting how they're how

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,700
they do something in the past is the way

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,500
that they're going to do it in the

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,510
future so you might ask them a question

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,400
is tell me about a time in your life and

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,400
your work or whatever where you've

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,010
solved a difficult problem describe to

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,690
me all the steps that you do right and

00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,680
then a lot of times they'll say well

00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,090
here's what I would do if I had a

00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,940
problem I do this in this and you say no

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,010
no no no tell me about a specific time

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,050
all the things that you did right

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,720
because if they behaved that way in the

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:12,550
past it's very very very likely they'll

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,550
do it that way in the future okay

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,640
yeah that minute that's great tell me

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,560
about a time right give me an example

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:41,940
you always ask for that so then there's

00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,710
three is from my business partner Larry

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,050
there's three things you want to

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,840
consider when you're hiring somebody

00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:52,300
motivation integrity and capacity you

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,220
look at the center of that you want to

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,680
make sure that they've got all three so

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,410
for an example if they have motivation

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,030
and a lot of capacity ability to do a

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:04,930
lot of work but they don't have

00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:05,560
integrity guess what they're gonna screw

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,040
you over

00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,840
all right if they have integrity and a

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:17,500
lot of capacity but they have no

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:18,940
motivation you know they just want to

00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,280
execute all right even though they have

00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:25,960
the capacity okay so you need all three

00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,920
of these together so capacity we're

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,590
going to talk about this a little bit

00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:35,170
I'll start over here so vertical axis is

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,570
their skill level horizontal is time

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,970
this is just an example of a day 60 day

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,140
60 when they start off working for you

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,490
day zero

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,770
they'll be initial skills now we're

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,360
gonna talk about like how much work they

00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,750
can get done in the area in the graph

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,970
but at day zero one person has this

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,340
level of skills that you need the other

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,050
has this level okay now ideally you want

00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,210
the highest skill level but it may not

00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:01,540
necessarily be true so they start off

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,030
this level so you have somebody that

00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:06,130
maybe not have as much capacity person a

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,210
but a day sixty they're here and they're

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,880
going up and they're improving their

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,470
skills but if you hire somebody that may

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,160
not have as many skills at the beginning

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:17,920
but a lot of capacity month two months

00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,930
or whatever they're gonna out they're

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:26,440
gonna exceed what the other person can

00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:28,360
do okay so when you're hiring it's it's

00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,600
the capacity because it mean if you

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,029
think

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,340
you hire somebody who's got there's a

00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:35,590
brilliant you know but they don't know

00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,299
HTML this is an extreme example but they

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,130
don't know HTML how long do you think

00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:40,210
it'll take them to really learn it and

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,850
become pretty good at it

00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:46,539
all right a few weeks but if they're

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:48,490
they're brilliant okay sometimes

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,679
sometimes clients will make the mistake

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,279
of saying I need expertise in a page

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,190
builder

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,970
I need expertise in Elementor or beaver

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,500
builder well it that probably doesn't

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,019
really matter as long as you may have

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,700
some experience in a page builder you

00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:06,090
can you can catch up and get the other

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,860
one pretty quick

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,389
okay so then when you hire somebody VA

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,120
you make sure you have them sign a

00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:15,129
contract so that they understand what

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,600
they're doing now it's not going to be

00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:18,190
in fort you're not gonna enforce it if

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,220
something goes bad nobody's gonna sue

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,899
anybody but it just sets the expectation

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,250
upfront that you're serious about your

00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:26,889
business you're serious about the

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:31,210
relationship managing it having it start

00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:36,789
off on the right foot okay in the first

00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:38,440
couple weeks are critical okay so when

00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:42,399
you're hiring somebody you want to blow

00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:46,330
the whistle early and hard in a way it's

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:51,070
it's it's kind of like raising kids and

00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:53,529
all and in certain aspects this is a

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,080
picture of a soccer referee I was a

00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:58,659
soccer referee for five years because I

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,669
had no idea what soccer was like the

00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:02,529
rules when my kids ran out I said oh I

00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,779
better learn it that's the best way to

00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:06,190
learn it being a ref right so what I but

00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,950
one of the things that I learned is at

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:11,620
the beginning of a match beginning of

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:14,320
the match you know there's these these

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,360
especially the guys as they get older

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,779
they can get pretty rough they can get

00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:22,929
pretty mean with each other so what I

00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:25,179
did is as soon as little blown the

00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:27,730
whistle they started with the ball as

00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:30,730
soon as I saw any little tiny infraction

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:32,559
that would not affect an advantage give

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,259
them an advantage either way one little

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,690
tiny infraction I blow the whistle it's

00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:41,169
probably a fox 40 whistle it's loud as

00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:42,370
heck and I blow it maybe Wow

00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:44,080
I'd say

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,110
watch it you don't want to hear it

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,110
anymore don't do it this way and it

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,580
helped the entire match okay so that's

00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,520
what you want to do when you're managing

00:29:51,580 --> 00:30:00,340
a person a new new person that comes on

00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:01,660
watch close okay thrive one of things

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,940
that you're going to do as a leader and

00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,920
you're a leader in any air so many areas

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,320
of your life with your family where you

00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,910
volunteer you're a leader there's no

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,380
question about it right your leader in

00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,600
your business you're leading your

00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,250
clients right you want to be clear on

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,090
but and within your team you want to be

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:21,130
clear on the priorities okay you working

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,020
as a engineer and a semiconductor

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:27,010
company I remember some of our bosses

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:28,510
I'd say you know what you've assigned us

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,990
these five programs what's the highest

00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:34,840
priority guess what he would say all of

00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,100
them well what was he doing he was

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,190
abdicating his leadership

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,530
responsibilities and putting it on me to

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,120
decide what was the highest priority all

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,559
right so you don't want to do that as

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,650
leader because otherwise your VA czar

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,110
gonna decide that all right you want to

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:52,210
gradually increase trust yeah I mean you

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,830
think about can you imagine giving

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,950
somebody especially even from another

00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:58,960
country or another part of the part of

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,220
this country or anywhere else root

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,220
access to your server

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,780
yikes

00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,510
so there's times when you you do that

00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,520
I've done that our developer has it now

00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,980
but he's been with me for you know four

00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:19,450
years right so you gradually increase

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,360
trust while we had a client who for

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:25,059
whatever reason she hired a new new

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:29,380
developer a first time ever ever and she

00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:32,890
gave him her login ID her user ID and

00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:35,230
her password to a couple of sites I'm

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,270
like why would you ever do that it

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:40,840
couldn't figure that out I just I still

00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:43,090
can to this day but she did that and is

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,520
it's okay right now it's turned out okay

00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:48,309
because she went and hired the person

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,110
who's who's got a lot of integrity so

00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,850
she she took care of that but everything

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,050
is fine but you want to gradually

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,220
increase trust and you want to

00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,700
communicate off and we have a weekly

00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,540
meeting with our team

00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,300
I want to do that in any business

00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:04,010
sometimes may be necessary to do a daily

00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:06,620
meeting a little scrum stand-up you want

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:10,220
to give and receive feedback okay you

00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:12,320
want to obviously say how things are

00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,270
going well not maybe not quite so well

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,130
but you want to be open and let them

00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,960
give you feedback because we all need to

00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,880
improve if we have time at the end I'll

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,710
give you two questions that you can use

00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,660
to improve yourself and in any way any

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,910
in any phase of your life I'll give you

00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,170
two questions question will be though

00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,270
for you is would you have the courage to

00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:38,930
ask those so remind me of that at the

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:41,330
end thrive continuous training right you

00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:43,600
guys are here awesome it's what you

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,100
should be doing continuous training your

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,770
assistants have to be trained as well

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,310
right things are changing very very

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,310
quickly

00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,940
anybody here was very happy with

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,990
Guttenberg and all that stuff that

00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:04,520
rolled out well yeah those have changed

00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:06,470
happen pretty quick and then if you are

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,780
running any kind of a business you need

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:12,530
to record videos on everything because

00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,300
the attitude you want to have is you

00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,640
want to act as if you want to hire 50

00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,470
people tomorrow and have them productive

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,960
right away right because if you're gonna

00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:25,610
go down the road of hiring somebody they

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,530
can leave right they can get sick and

00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,620
you want to be able to get somebody up

00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,240
to speed as quick as possible plus if

00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,430
you're building a business and you want

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,050
to have a good exit plan someday you've

00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,630
got to have this as it's really

00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:41,630
intellectual property documenting your

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,980
process and your the way to do things

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,510
because then you could sell your

00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,530
business and somebody else could pick it

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,920
up pretty quickly

00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:52,190
it's about there's value there okay you

00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,720
want to spend time on your business take

00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,120
a look at the e-myth I don't know if you

00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,770
guys have ever heard of that at all okay

00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:02,570
great book I can't remember the author

00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:04,130
but it's awesome

00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,210
it talks the dip talks about the

00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,060
difference between working in your

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,849
business and on your business okay I'll

00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,490
give you a little hint here coming up

00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:16,520
all right we're almost done so this came

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:18,109
from Brian sure and I had Daphne create

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,450
this nice meme for me so I could

00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:22,339
remember it so the entrepreneur of

00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:25,220
golden rule never do anything you can

00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:27,859
pay someone else less money to do but

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:31,129
what does that really mean it means only

00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:33,829
spend time developing and refining your

00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:35,210
systems and generating generating

00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:38,389
revenue through sales and marketing

00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,560
systems right and systems are training

00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:41,540
others to do things that are paid less

00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,990
than you through checklist procedures

00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,800
training and practice / role-playing

00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,359
don't get caught up in the trap of

00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,579
trying to do it all yourself and

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,240
thinking you're saving money because

00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:56,810
you're not you're not if you use if you

00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,770
can shift between editing CSS on your

00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:04,160
site all of the time changing it versus

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:06,859
deciding what and working on a new

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,170
product in your in your business that's

00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:10,400
gonna get you more revenue and help you

00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,579
as your company make a bigger difference

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,680
out there all right

00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:18,740
so the one takeaway for you guys to have

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,750
on this yeah that's why I ended started

00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,119
and ended with this business is a

00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,950
profitable enterprise if I can say that

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,760
business is a profitable enterprise that

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:31,730
works with or without you otherwise

00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,589
you've really got a job and that may be

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,869
okay or it may not be okay it's just

00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:42,170
important for you to have the self

00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:47,079
awareness of what you want to do there's

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:51,950
the slides hard my va.com slash wcwc SCV

00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:54,170
that's one thing though right now hun

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:57,140
even contact me there

00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:58,849
my company is Pro website creators for a

00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,819
web development you can contact me there

00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:06,099
as well

00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:09,099
and that's it we are almost 1140

00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:09,099
questions

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,099
and back

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:27,710
website translation to different

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:30,440
languages right I have none Wow

00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,290
would that be like when you say website

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,630
translation would that be in a specific

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,630
language or all of them

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,140
hoping to capture people another market

00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,880
that might not understand but are still

00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:59,180
really interested in getting this

00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,180
information

00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:05,520
so so like thinking about multilingual

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:09,079
like the website another language and

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,079
then we having people

00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:16,529
yeah I would for what depends it depends

00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,269
amount on if you're talking about

00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:19,589
website translation it depends upon how

00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,599
often I think you're gonna do it the way

00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:24,660
I would approach it is if this is like a

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,759
one-time shot for a client ile and a lot

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,229
of he lands but whatever the job

00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:30,029
outsourcing thing I'd do something like

00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:31,499
that but if it's something that you're

00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:37,199
saying okay we've got a client who needs

00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:39,839
this site translated into Spanish right

00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,119
but we do one of those every month or

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,769
whatever it may be worth it

00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,630
but you'd probably want to have to

00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:48,329
supplement that with may not just be the

00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,880
website but it could be translation of

00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:53,249
marketing material or email follow-ups

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,900
all that kind of stuff too so I think it

00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:56,249
depends upon how often you do it if the

00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,180
language is going to be the same every

00:37:56,249 --> 00:38:01,799
time I know there's translation plugins

00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:12,289
they can be done for websites and they

00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:12,289
do they do decent okay yeah

00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:23,560
yeah so so yeah in that case you would

00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,930
have to validate in the language that

00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,930
you don't speak or not familiar with

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,860
then you'd have to hire one person that

00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,130
seems pretty good

00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:35,590
but you've got to find somebody else to

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,210
do a check until you until you trust

00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,940
because you're right you really don't

00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:43,740
know you don't know so you've really got

00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:46,900
to do a to tooth to faze kind of

00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,700
validation and there's and there's lots

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,110
of there's lots of kids at schools who

00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,030
speak different languages especially I

00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,460
mean you live in the place where you'll

00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,350
probably find somebody you know within a

00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:14,470
few miles of speak of any language you

00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:16,360
know it's out there up work and you

00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,680
could and and what like we're talking

00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:22,080
about you could hire two different

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,080
people and see how they translate it

00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:43,030
yeah you can't prevent it there's no way

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:45,250
to prevent it but what we say up front

00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:49,410
is we want depending upon what you're

00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:52,000
doing we we advocate hiring full-time

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:55,450
the reason is because if somebody's

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,110
part-time then they've got likely more

00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:02,440
than two clients and then guess who's

00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:05,200
gonna get the most energy and effort the

00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,140
client that screams the loudest so what

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,600
we we talk about hiring part-time only

00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:13,720
if you're really confident that that's

00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,460
an exclusive part-time work like like

00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,860
Daphne for me she first started twenty

00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,540
hours that's all she wanted to work now

00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,360
she's like thirty hours so she's not

00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,680
totally full time but we're exclusive

00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,620
and so that's one things that you want

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,340
to emphasize to people that you hire as

00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,470
a virtual

00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,360
that because of that you know you're

00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,980
competing with another person but you

00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,410
know you can't prevent them from doing

00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,420
something else on the other side on the

00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,560
side hopefully if they do something on

00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,730
the side and you know maybe it is

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,800
building their own business doing

00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,440
something else that wouldn't necessarily

00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,910
compete with you but in that case

00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,860
hopefully you'll hire somebody that is

00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,630
you know pretty open with you and you

00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,160
would encourage them to talk about it

00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:56,520
because maybe you want to help them as a

00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,520
as a business owner I mean why not what

00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:20,410
a good question so it's tools and time

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:24,070
zone so tools is a lot of the people we

00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:27,040
work with use Trello for the task

00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:30,370
management type of thing and then slack

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,450
for daily communication and there's

00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,830
probably other ones out there that's

00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,130
what most people do there use the free

00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,810
versions we use Basecamp because

00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,360
Basecamp is more of an all-in-one you

00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:42,310
have different projects and you can do

00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:49,480
your chat and all that and then as far

00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:53,860
as communication goes we use zoom for

00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:55,720
our calls we get on and you can use

00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:58,440
Skype a lot of people use Skype and then

00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,910
the other question was about the hours

00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,080
believe it or not there are people that

00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:09,310
do their best work in the evenings or

00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:11,080
very early in the mornings some people

00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,850
like and if you're on the East Coast

00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:16,150
it's like the Philippines it's basically

00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:18,310
12 hours that's tough but what you have

00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:21,250
to decide up front is what overlap do

00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:23,500
you want like for me we've recent and

00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:26,370
it's an adjustment process like for

00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:29,320
Brian he was falling asleep sometimes

00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:30,700
because he was working in the middle of

00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,870
the night and wasn't just that it

00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,370
happened at the beginning but he had

00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,170
other things going on in their life in

00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:38,950
his life that he had to deal with during

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,990
the day so we changed it to art he

00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,640
starts at 2:00 p.m.

00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:46,869
approximately 2:00 p.m. our time and

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,750
work still I tell them I want 2 p.m. to

00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:51,550
5 p.m. or 6 p.m. to be the minimum

00:42:49,750 --> 00:43:08,760
overlap times the rest of the time just

00:42:51,550 --> 00:43:12,700
work at whatever you want yeah so um

00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,470
like we use online jobs dot pH that's

00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,820
what we use a lot but you can sometimes

00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,670
you can use virtual staff finder there's

00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:22,570
other ones out there but one of the

00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:24,400
first things we do is they send us an

00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:26,890
email right say it has Batman in the

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,160
subject line or we change it to Superman

00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:32,410
pick your favorite comic character right

00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,150
and they do that right and then I

00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,070
respond with them and I say ok here's my

00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:39,250
key requirements are you ok with that

00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:44,650
meaning overlap these hours this amount

00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:46,090
of pay range daily reporting and we

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,590
might have something else in there too

00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,580
communication with zoom or whatever

00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:52,260
right and if they respond yes well I'm

00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,970
ok with that

00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,650
all right good then we look and see what

00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:59,980
their what the salary is that they

00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,800
wanted on their profile because

00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,880
sometimes they'll say the salary is okay

00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,100
but if the salary that they have on

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,680
their profile that they want way exceeds

00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,910
what I can offer then we may talk to

00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,460
them but that goes on the back burner

00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:15,250
because what I'm afraid of is that if

00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,470
somebody takes the job because you know

00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,600
they need jobs over there somebody takes

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,460
the job but then on the side they're

00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,890
gonna be looking for somebody else to

00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,150
pay them more all right and so they may

00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:27,100
leave quick so I don't want to have that

00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,170
happen but that would be but if their

00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,790
qualifications are great still may

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,109
interview them and try to understand why

00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,210
because sometimes they'll put that in

00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:35,800
their thinking well I just want to get

00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:39,960
that much but I don't have to have that

00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,960
much good questions

00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:50,570
like hiring hiring without work

00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:53,680
would would it be appropriate to ask one

00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:57,390
of these you know someone to do like

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,390
developer tests of some sort

00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:03,590
that they can actually do

00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:07,580
yeah it's it so so here's the thing is

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:10,820
the way you want to test is I mean

00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,140
ideally you don't want to test you don't

00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,630
want to test on things that are gonna

00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:17,780
happen I have a disagreement with this

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:20,450
with some folks but it's like a website

00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,670
goes down you have you know 500 internal

00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:25,520
server right oh can you debug that and

00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,980
find out what's wrong well I mean that

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,840
that is a test in a way but how often

00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:33,920
does that really happen to somebody I

00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:36,230
don't want to base my decision on having

00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,640
them complete a task that's rarely gonna

00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:43,220
happen right or that they can search and

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,270
find the solution pretty quick I mean I

00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,060
want to base it on

00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:50,630
do you know here's here's what here's a

00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,430
side note you know I've taken a bunch of

00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,500
different courses on programming

00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,359
language and stuff so many of them make

00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,400
the here's the biggest mistake that I

00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:59,930
think that they all make in those

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,880
courses and if you're gonna take a

00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:04,550
course look for this they don't teach

00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,010
you how to debug the first thing that

00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:08,810
they should do is say here's how to do

00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,580
something but when something goes wrong

00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:12,830
like we talked about leaving out a

00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:15,859
semicolon or putting the you know the

00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:18,440
the the apostrophe right how do you

00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:19,910
figure that out right how do you do you

00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,770
have a way to step through the code to

00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:25,400
see what line it is right I told you I

00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:27,080
did some iOS apps there the Apple tools

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,310
are brilliant in that you know you step

00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,970
through your code and feet see what's

00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:35,060
wrong so so that's what you want to try

00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:36,440
to understand how they think through

00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,150
things and how they can figure it out

00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,070
and you can when you're giving them a

00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:43,460
skills test ask them to do whatever you

00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:45,619
want and then you might ask them to say

00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,150
okay take five minutes or 10 minutes to

00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:48,800
search the web and find it because

00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,859
that's that's what's practical right

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,130
it's not necessarily what they remember

00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:58,220
at the time because they did it three

00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:00,349
years ago it might it's more like how

00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,030
fast can you figure out the solution and

00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:05,300
get it and get it done but yeah it's

00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:08,660
totally appropriate like we had one

00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:11,119
person who applied for a job who didn't

00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,740
even know how to use at all or didn't

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,400
even know it was available the debugger

00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,200
in the browser

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,300
- didn't even know how to right-click

00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,580
and do inspect and to be able to use

00:47:18,300 --> 00:48:26,180
that well to me that's like wow that was

00:47:20,580 --> 00:48:29,590
pretty yep

00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:33,040
extracting the responsibility

00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:35,830
editing aside from somebody who is seven

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:39,280
and double time zones away they take a

00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:41,770
lot of time so be very careful if you

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:49,000
choose to do this folks and that these

00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:51,130
people yep then that's why right and

00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,990
that's why most of the time when people

00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:54,700
try to find people like that they'll

00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,470
skip remember those those that Venn

00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,540
diagram right they'll skip that

00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,190
motivation and integrity part right

00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,770
we've had clients come to us it's like

00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:04,750
you know my developer skipped out on me

00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:06,550
so that's so that's like those are great

00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,940
points here's another great point though

00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:13,360
it happens here as well anywhere my wife

00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,640
she works at a non-profit the leading

00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,650
nonprofit education nonprofit in

00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:22,090
California third ranked in the country

00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:24,730
as far as revenue and she had an

00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:28,330
executive assistant was working out

00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:30,220
great do you remember the it didn't turn

00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:32,410
out this bad but remember the Las Vegas

00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:35,170
shooting a year year-and-a-half ago she

00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:37,690
was there she was running and somebody

00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,540
got shot next to her all right

00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:42,880
so she ended up get having

00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:45,460
post-traumatic stress and having to take

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,970
time off a significant time off and then

00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:50,350
she eventually left she just wasn't it

00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,720
was hard for her to get the same my wife

00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:55,000
you know they had and we live in Irvine

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,730
right they're people that are sick like

00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,350
crazy right now I mean it's just it's

00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:04,540
just people it's just life it really is

00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:07,510
sometimes hard to find really good

00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,400
people my brother-in-law works for

00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:12,550
federal Federal Express he has worked

00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,460
for them for 40-plus years he has cases

00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:17,020
I he used to train and be a station

00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,630
management trained people he's an HR now

00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:21,640
but he has sit they've had situations

00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:23,410
where they had hire somebody train him

00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,750
for six or eight weeks to drive the

00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:28,120
truck and deliver but then something

00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:30,880
would happen and then what they would do

00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,190
middle of the day pull the pull the

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,740
truck onto the side pull out the key

00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:39,640
give them a call and say I put your key

00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:41,030
over here I'm quitting all right all

00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:45,480
right

00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:47,430
so yeah III I hear what you're saying

00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,150
how it sourcing is not for the faint of

00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:53,100
heart it isn't but it does take some

00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:56,610
time but it depends upon what you want

00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:59,630
to do right I want to produce amazing

00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:02,220
results for my clients I want to produce

00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:05,460
great websites I want to expand my

00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:08,640
capability I need help in what I do I am

00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:11,010
I'm weak in so many areas I want to

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,660
create a team that that that can do

00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:17,880
amazing stuff and and we do we do but

00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:20,490
like you said it has taken me some time

00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,650
the first developer I hired oh my gosh

00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:29,790
he he just took forever to do things it

00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:35,930
finally took me a while to let him go no

00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:35,930
I don't know why

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,840
well the other thing too is on you that

00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,940
can you've heard of all the stuff about

00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,070
people taking Twitter to get counts down

00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,320
within companies that exist in the

00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:08,390
United States as well right so that can

00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,550
happen with anybody that you hire number

00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:13,040
one number two you have to gradually

00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,950
increase trust with people number three

00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,780
is you need to make sure you've got good

00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:23,480
backup solutions so those types of

00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:25,580
things really can't happen now anytime

00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,010
you are going to give up control if you

00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,020
want to build a business there's no

00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:32,590
question that there is a risk that

00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:35,000
somebody could really screw you over

00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,650
there's that risk but it just depends

00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,030
upon what you want to do right do you

00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:42,200
want to build a business and makes a big

00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:45,560
difference for clients that you may have

00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,210
a problem here and there but and I know

00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,850
there's stories out there all that stuff

00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:51,200
happening but I tell you the difference

00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,460
that some of this stuff is making the

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,060
some of our clients the people that

00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,340
we've worked with

00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:57,650
I mean it's freeing up their lives to be

00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,970
able to do other things we have the one

00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:01,940
one lady had just helped to get a

00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,290
developer she has a small small son he's

00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,780
gonna get pregnant again she needs

00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:09,980
somebody to help her while she's going

00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:11,690
through all that and so for me those are

00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,460
risks I want to take there's risks

00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,440
everywhere just getting in your car

00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,530
driving may get hit by a drunk driver

00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,880
right but you don't not drive there's

00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,320
risk than everything you want to do you

00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,940
want to you want to build a great

00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,920
business you want to be a great person

00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:29,390
you want to do amazing things for your

00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:31,190
clients I mean there's risk absolutely

00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:33,350
what are you gonna do here what's your

00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:34,790
client gonna say when you're you're in

00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,270
the hospital because I'm gonna happened

00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,980
ectopy

00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:42,080
and they need to change on their site

00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:42,800
that's not gonna go well oh I'm glad you

00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,500
reminded me

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,020
okay yeah we should probably done woman

00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,580
with this okay all right

00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,690
two questions now you have to have the

00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,880
courage to do this that'll help you in

00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,990
any relationship that you have okay the

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,890
first question this came from Jack

00:53:53,990 --> 00:54:00,650
Canfield first question is what's your

00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:03,860
name or in Belgrade Oren nice to meet

00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:07,460
you alright so imagine that I'm your

00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,880
boss alright so Oren I ask you I'm your

00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,330
boss

00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,920
see

00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,080
oran I really need you to give me an

00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,300
honest answer to this because if you

00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,530
don't give me an honest answer to these

00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,750
two questions it's not gonna help me

00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:21,460
okay would you do that for me Warren

00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:25,400
all right so on a scale of zero to ten

00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:29,000
how would you rate me as a boss ten

00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,950
being best boss in the entire world zero

00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,020
being worst I need you to be honest

00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,070
there's no repercussions or anything I

00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:41,480
need you to be honest how would you rate

00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:43,700
me give me a seven seven okay great okay

00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:47,690
great I'm a seven

00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:50,510
I said so then Oren in your mind what

00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:53,720
would I need to do to move from a seven

00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,960
to ten bring it more work okay there you

00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,960
go

00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,840
you can do this with your spouse you can

00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,990
say like I said if you have the courage

00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,580
honey

00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,110

husband there I want to be a better wife

how would you rate me as a husband on a

00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:09,190
scale of zero to ten ten being like out

00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,350
of this world

00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:15,980
