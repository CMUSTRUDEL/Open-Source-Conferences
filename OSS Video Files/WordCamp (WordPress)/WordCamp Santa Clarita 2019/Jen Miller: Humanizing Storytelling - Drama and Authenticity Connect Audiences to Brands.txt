00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,060
loud okay thanks I'm not gonna yell at

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,240
you

00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,529
how's this better okay great okay so I'm

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,739
Jen Miller we're gonna be talking today

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:36,470
about humanizing storytelling drama and

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:39,469
authenticity connects audiences to

00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,300
brands and I'm sure some of you read

00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:43,130
that and said what does that even mean

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,360
what is where is she going with this

00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:50,570
topic and what it means is getting real

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,740
with yourself with your brand with your

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,960
teammates with your shareholders with

00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,100
your audience your clients and your

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,440
customers and peeling back the layer one

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,290
of my clients called it opening the

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,140
kimono you know so to speak so that

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,860
you're letting your humanity show

00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:15,530
through in your brand and the man in

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,829
this picture right here is my

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,359
grandfather he's no longer with us but

00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:28,299
he was very instrumental in my life

00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:31,340
because he was very adventurous and as

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:34,789
he he helped me to get to know this area

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,920
actually I am I was born in the Los

00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,959
Angeles area I grew up in that area and

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,380
now live in Orange County but we would

00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,600
come up to Lake Castaic and have

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,009
fantastic days there and so I got to

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,079
know your community a little bit through

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:50,740
my grandfather so I thought I'd share a

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:55,579
little bit about me through the slides

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:57,939
because humanizing yourself and your

00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:01,549
brand has to do with being vulnerable

00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:04,359
opening yourself up to things that may

00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:07,759
seem a little unordinary sometimes and

00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:11,510
you can do that with a concept of brand

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,550
a product a business and yourself and it

00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,360
means saying who you are what you're

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:20,090
about and what you do so like I said my

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,330
grandfather was an adventurer that was

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,180
his brand that's me we all knew that he

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,040
was not the person to go to for advice

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,660
it was not the person to go to if I

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,240
wanted just a lovey-dovey

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,830
that was not my grandfather but if I

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,650
wanted to try something new

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:41,300
guess who I'd call so every brand

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,910
represents something and it just depends

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,600
on what you choose to do with yours and

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:50,000
how you want to have yours be said

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,940
through your website through your social

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,860
media through your email marketing

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,010
through all the different assets that

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,790
you pull together to make this brand how

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,510
many people in the room are

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:06,230
entrepreneurs how many of you are

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,240
business owners people are saying what's

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,710
the difference right an entrepreneur

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,840
runs their own business a business owner

00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,850
usually has a team that helps them run

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,310
their business or helps them grow so

00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:20,030
they can step away a little bit how many

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:24,410
of you work for a corporation only two

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,400
okay and how many of your students how

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,030
many of you fit in none of those

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:33,260
categories all right so any new to

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:36,020
WordPress awesome okay so we have a big

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,690
mix of people here that people who are

00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:43,760
other categories can you tell me what

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:45,320
you are retired and interested that's

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,100
the best thing it would be right and

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,410
then teach elementary school that's

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,320
awesome so you're a teacher fantastic I

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,600
actually am gonna be working with one of

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,430
my local elementary schools to help get

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,390
their kids on the web and teach them how

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:06,110
to build their own websites in May so

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,640
near and dear all right so don't be

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,490
afraid to let people see what's inside

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,490
because that's where the connection is

00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,560
made and going to detail as you try to

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:19,040
spread your message on your website and

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,260
show fun photos so if you have photos of

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
yourself doing something that is any way

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,030
related to your business or is on your

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,040
lunch break show those show what's going

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,170
on because people want to know a little

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,290
more about you so that they can trust

00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,670
your brand if you have teammates and you

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,740
guys are having some kind of

00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,900
team-building experience you know

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,040
playing darts together or if you're

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,140
going to lunch or you're attending

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,270
those are the kinds of things that help

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,030
others to know that you are involved and

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,770
that you are gonna help them to for

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,770
themselves because they can see that you

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:56,640
are very active in what you do with your

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:59,430
messaging know what your brand stands

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,090
for and align with stories that showcase

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:05,700
it so with my company we work with about

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,310
60% real estate clients that's a lot of

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,680
real estate some of them are in the same

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,050
markets but we're able to differentiate

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,970
because we pay attention to their

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,440
personalities their brand their voice

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:23,580
and every one of them is affiliated with

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,250
a different national chain so those

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:32,910
chains are known for some things

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:35,850
Sotheby's is known for luxury ok red fin

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:40,290
is known for that 1% right it's it's a

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,970
discount listing service Keller Williams

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,710
I don't know if you know this but

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,500
they're known for connection and

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,350
community they are very involved in both

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,419
their clients lives and in their

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:55,440
community doing charity work so because

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:58,050
of that we would not use messaging for a

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,110
28 million dollar home when we're

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,320
talking about redfin just as we if we're

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,210
presenting you know information on a

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,590
Sotheby's agent we're not going to be

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,810
talking about first time home buying

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:13,320
because most first-time homebuyers are

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,940
not millionaires right so you have to

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,910
make that connection as you're

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,160
establishing the brand because the

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,780
stories we use must align to our brand

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,580
whether we're writing for our own

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,540
companies or whether we're writing for

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,780
other people and it's important to

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:35,460
recognize that you can't be all things

00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:37,440
to everyone so choose one thing and have

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,760
that be your messaging maybe you do

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,120
everything the same as another

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,040
competitor of yours but you excel at

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,990
your second bullet point whatever that

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,580
might be that's what you're gonna want

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,800
to use for your messaging maybe for that

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,169
month and just kind of let people know

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,240
we excel at this because then someone

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,650
could call you up to say

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,889
hey I want to work with you because I

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:03,270
know you're so good at whatever it was

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:06,509
that you named and awards and facts and

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,000
numbers are really impressive but they

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,180
don't tell the story a lot of times we

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,150
see people using those types of things

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,310
in their messaging and it doesn't

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,830
accomplish their goals because nobody

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,610
really cares you care I mean when I get

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:26,370
an award it's awesome right but nobody

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,900
else really looks too hard they're going

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,979
to want to see basic qualifications

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,380
maybe and you can have those in the

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,050
footer of your website and of course if

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,419
you're honored at an event or you're

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,430
sponsoring an event as a company you

00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,659
want to do a blog post on that you want

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,789
to have it all over social media you

00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,449
want to invite people to your event that

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,409
type of thing

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:48,389
but typically anything you're bragging

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:51,620
about with yourself it's probably not

00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:53,909
gonna fly very well with your audience

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,560
because they don't really tell your

00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,250
brand story they just tell one little

00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,139
piece of it sometimes we have clients

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,139
that come to us and say we just want to

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,090
use a fun voice we want to wear for

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,060
hilarious people like they self-identify

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,889
and they want to make sure that that's

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,050
conveyed in their blog in their website

00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:14,610
content and those are the clients we

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,840
have the most fun with because what they

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,990
think is funny and what we think is

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,990
funny isn't always the same but you know

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,060
you try to get to that happy medium and

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,979
what's nice is that when you can nail it

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,810
when you can get there then you can

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:31,789
carry it through the social media and

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:35,399
it's so amazing to see how the audience

00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:37,440
recognizes the voice and they can help

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,719
that messaging because it's being used

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,099
in all the different platforms so they

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,110
help to spread that and they tell people

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,760
about you because you're doing something

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,230
different doesn't mean you have to be

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,000
funny but you have to figure out what

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,670
your differentiator is going to be

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,490
because that's what makes your company

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:55,829
you as an individual and you know as a

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,810
teacher even that's what makes you human

00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:59,250
that's what makes the kids relate and

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,980
want to stay awake while you're talking

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,370
and by the way I recognize that it's

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,590
3:30 so thank you all for showing up to

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,540
the last session and for staying

00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,370
like I don't see anyone sleeping yet I'm

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,110
so impressed good job

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:17,850
must have been all those fruit snacks so

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:21,210
humanizing this story is about sharing

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,100
like I said and there are many ways that

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,840
you can share you can share through a

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,660
blog post and of course that's something

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,190
that I'm pretty well-versed in I can

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,020
give you specific pointers on that

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,030
either in other talks that I've done or

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,120
if you come up and talk to me go to my

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:38,730
website there's plenty of information

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,140
but videos are a great way to connect

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:46,920
with your audience as well and it's

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,770
underutilized if you do a facebook live

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,040
just on the spot and share that with

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,660
your audience people may not watch it

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,730
right that moment but they will come

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,920
back and you'll be surprised at how many

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,390
views that video actually gets over time

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,000
because it's not going to go anywhere

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,980
you can also pull that off put it on

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,810
your YouTube you can do all kinds of

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:12,150
things if you have that video content

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,680
and you can edit it sometimes a team

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,090
member might do something that you want

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,340
to talk about or interview them about

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:23,280
it's a great thing to do on as a video

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,610
if you are looking for things to talk

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,950
about

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,360
think about what was the first sign when

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,470
you first started your business because

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,300
there are a lot of entrepreneurs and

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,100
business owners in here what was the

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,100
first thing that signaled to you that

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,230
your business was a success what let you

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,200
know that you are on the right path tell

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:43,740
that story that's something that people

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,660
don't do but it's interesting right and

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,160
when we connect with new people what's

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,190
the first thing we ask what do you do

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,420
how did you get started share that with

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,360
your audience because they're curious

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,700
about it too and it's ways to get your

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,220
followers invested in what you do so

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,670
that they'll maybe share your story okay

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:06,030

questions and you're gonna have a second

00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:38,879
to think about it but as we're talking

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,889
about messaging and what you're doing

00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,059

00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:47,489

00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,130
crazy decision and our culture which is

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,870

minutes from here I think and my grandpa

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,050
and I used to my grandpa remember from

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,179
the beginning we used to visit often

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,130
because it was one of his favorite

00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:12,040
places to go

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:14,620
he was a windsurfer and so when it got

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,690
to be a breezy day we would drive up to

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,270
Lake Castaic and we'd spend the whole

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,300
day on

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:23,720

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:27,530
many great memories from it but here's

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,940
the thing no one made me go I chose to

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,590
go and that's why I have those good

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,970
memories that's why I can talk about

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,920

I was able to share that the same is

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:42,770
true for business events to build your

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:46,370
brand you need to gain that insight in

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:48,890
the content and you've got to be able to

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,440
talk to the people who are either using

00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,870
your product or similar in similar

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,730
industries or like companion industries

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,010
or even your competition and to do that

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:02,600
you have to show up places whether it's

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:05,720
a word camp or a chamber or a beauty

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:10,760
shop to overhear conversations you know

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,530
whatever a financial meeting you know

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,200
maybe a meet-up where people are saying

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,550
I don't know how to budget if you attend

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,190
those kinds of things you're gonna be

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:22,070
able to know what the questions are that

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,630
are asked now a couple of you that came

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,700
up here actually said that people are

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,990
already emailing you and asking you

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,850
questions on your website that is

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,640
fantastic you just need to be able to

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,250
turn that those questions into content

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,460
that you use whether as videos that you

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,980
release or podcasts or blog posts so

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:43,280
that that way people know that you're

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,810
hearing them and answering them because

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,300
that's the most powerful thing you can

00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,070
do on your website is engaged with your

00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,380
readers because it builds your following

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,510
how many of you have seen a good deal

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,090
somewhere and called up a friend and

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,340
said you've got to check this out okay

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:02,450
most of us have at some point in our

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:05,060
lives and you don't do the that's how

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,830
websites are shared people come across

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,570
something that's how sitcoms are shared

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,620
right have you seen this Netflix series

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,470
you have to check it out

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:15,800
like it's just the way we communicate as

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,620
humans when we're not texting so that's

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,720
that's something that we we need to give

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,340
that content to people so they're able

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,630
to use it and they're able to share it

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,550
for us I first started coming to

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:31,120
WordPress events because of my friend

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:34,309
Ben Muller anyone know Ben

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,190
didn't think so Ben was from Riverside I

00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:40,190
was from Huntington Beach but we worked

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,740
at the same company and he was one of

00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,270
our coders and I was his project manager

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,059
at the time and so we would talk back

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:49,070
and forth and most of the time he didn't

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,240
like what I had to say and you know we

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,760
had to work through all that and we

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,799
ended up being great friends well one

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,570
day he called and said hey I'm heading

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,030
out to the Huntington Beach WordPress

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,910
meetup you want to go and I said oh I

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,200
can't go you know to nighttime events

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,620
like that's just not going to happen

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,030
with my current situation but but thanks

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,250
why don't you come for dinner you know

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,440
so he came over had dinner with me and

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,030
my family was great we got to know each

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,190
other even better because we were

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:18,350
face-to-face and then he went off to the

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,290
Meetup the next day he said you know

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,840
they taped those so for the next year I

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:26,570
actually did tune in and watch the meet

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,190
up online so that I could figure out

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,030
what was going on and what this whole

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:33,590
WordPress thing was beyond my blogging

00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,240
interface knowledge you know I knew how

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,580
to put a post up and I knew how to do a

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,410
little bit of CSS but I I didn't know

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,830
much more and through watching that

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,140
meetup I was able to learn a lot so

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,169
after about a year I decided it was time

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,299
that I show up to the physical meetup so

00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:52,730
I actually went there and suddenly

00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:54,500
before her I could even think about it I

00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,740
was involved in the community that

00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:02,929
happened to anyone here really well

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:05,360
you're all here so obviously so before I

00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,850
couldn't you know I found people who

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,200
were like-minded who loved the web sites

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,370
who were fans of WordPress and who

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,070
understood when I talked about blogging

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,720
and SEO and content like they may not

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,870
understand it on the same level that I

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,000
did but they they got it you know they

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:26,360
didn't shut me up click within five

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,400
minutes and so that made me feel really

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,309
comfortable and I started attending and

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,830
speaking at events and sharing my same

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:37,130
message that I had at the very beginning

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:39,049
when I before I ever even came to

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,830
WordPress about sharing your content

00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:41,830
message and

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:51,380
it was a message I believed in and it it

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,440
allowed me to help other people

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,030
understand how they could do content in

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,270
a way that it would build their brand

00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,830
and build their marketing my focus in

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,770
the beginning was on the blog hence the

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,600
name need someone to blog we've grown we

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,150
do a lot more things I actually have two

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,120
companies now so we've really expanded

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,200
but the underlying message is still the

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,580
same and I repeat it everywhere I go my

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,500
business name states my message and

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:22,430
makes it easy for people to know who

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:26,000
they can come to as a resource and going

00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:28,520
to events is is a way to be able to make

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:35,540
this connection see those people whether

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:37,280
you're a brand or an individual so some

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,500
people think of this a little

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,190
differently I tie my personal branding

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,960
to my business branding and the reason

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,060
why I do that is because I'm the one

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,800
who's showing up to the events if my

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,860
team were coming to the events which we

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,230
had one one of our writers came

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,570
yesterday and so because she was coming

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,800
I would have talked about her if she

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:04,790
were here today but she wasn't able to

00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:08,090
come both days and sharing who's behind

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:10,790
the scene like that is important I think

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:14,090
because it helps all of us to know the

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:16,910
message and making sure that those

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,200
people who are working with you can

00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:24,050
share the message as well that they

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:29,470
understand it clearly let's see I'm not

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:33,950
going to say that well I will okay so

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:36,200
yesterday my grandmother died and it was

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:40,550
pretty emotional and I considered not

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,170
coming this weekend but I thought about

00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,770
it and I'm like I always say you have to

00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:48,620
show up so I decided I would show up and

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,400
she lived a great life she was 95 it's

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,549
all good

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:58,559
it just somehow was unexpected you know

00:24:53,549 --> 00:25:02,509
and but coming here and seeing familiar

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:05,879
faces people who I consider good friends

00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:09,119
comforted me and it made it a place

00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:11,249
where instead of feeling awkward and

00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,919
weird and I just want to be alone I

00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:15,779
suddenly was yeah I want to be a part of

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,580
this I want to think about something

00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:21,179
else I want to have some good

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:25,019
conversation with my friends and that's

00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:26,850
part of being human and coming out from

00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:28,529
behind the internet which i think is a

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,549
place we all feel really safe to hide a

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:37,230
lot so show up find those opportunities

00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:39,359
look for them so that you can help your

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,580
humanity as well because you're gonna

00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:46,230
find solace when you attend these events

00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:48,389
and when you when you get more involved

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,570
and don't just try to hide behind the

00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:56,330
screen okay but don't forget that data

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:59,070
brings conversions data matters right

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,259
like we want to see the numbers behind

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,970
things I told you before don't just

00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:06,779
focus on those numbers but we still want

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:08,789
to see it as you show people the numbers

00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,169
you can elevate your message and you

00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,470
connect the dots for them so they

00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:16,230
understand how everything happens but we

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,480
don't want them to get lost so data is

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,220
something that you need to understand so

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,629
that you know how to track what pages

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:28,019
your people are coming into what how

00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:29,909
many but what your traffic is like what

00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,769
keywords are working for you if you're a

00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:35,700
blogger what videos are working for you

00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:38,879
if you're not and sharing facts and

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:42,629
figures with your audience that relates

00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:43,830
to them that's all about you know how

00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:45,809
many of them are coming to your site

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:51,470
they don't need to know that what they

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:51,470
do need to know is what works and so

00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:55,529
it's better to talk in generalities I

00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,899
feel when it comes to numbers because

00:26:55,529 --> 00:27:01,619
nobody gets bogged down in them when I

00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:03,119
was 18 yes I did start young I was 14

00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:06,330
when I was writing for my college paper

00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,649
or my my high high school paper

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,500
but at 18 I was running from my college

00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:14,730
paper but I also worked for a group of

00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:16,260
canoes papers and they assigned me

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,309
because I was the youngest one on the

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:23,640
team to a story I had to go to 30

00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:25,049
different liquor stores bars and grocery

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,539
stores and try to buy alcohol

00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:32,659
I had a chaperone she sat in my

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,460
passenger seat but I was the driver and

00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:37,380
we went to these different

00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,429
establishments throughout our community

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,779
because there had been a problem with

00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:44,789
teens and drunk driving and we wanted to

00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:48,360
figure out where was it coming from and

00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:50,399
so we had a spreadsheet and wrote down

00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,169
the name of the place what time we went

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,149
there what date we had all the

00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:56,399
information because we were gonna blast

00:27:54,149 --> 00:28:02,970
this to the community once my story was

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:07,529
ready once we found out that 30% of the

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:10,350
establishments were selling to minors my

00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:12,840
boss the publisher of the newspaper got

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,460
scared and he said I need to call our

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,529
legal team and make sure we can publish

00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,220
this cuz we're gonna be getting some

00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:22,320
agencies in trouble and so he called and

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,409
they said do not publish those facts and

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,870
figures speak in generalities tell what

00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:29,940
you did tell that you turned the booze

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,630
all into the police station

00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,460
tell the an adult went with her like you

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:40,320
can see those things but don't say when

00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:43,409
where who or how and so we didn't we

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,580
published and the article talked about

00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:50,519
30 percent one number and the

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:53,789
communities that I went to and the

00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:58,289
feelings that we had going through it so

00:28:53,789 --> 00:29:00,269
it was more of a column versus a an uzi

00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:02,190
type article which is of course what we

00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:03,990
were trying for in the beginning and

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:09,120
that kept me out of jail which was

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:11,970
awesome but what it also did was it made

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,360
the community very aware and we had a

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:18,929
group of parents who got together and

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,610
they went to individual businesses

00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:22,799
throughout all of

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,330
you canvass three communities so they

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,580
went through all those communities and

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:29,040
they asked the businesses to pledge not

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,420
to sell alcohol to minors have them sign

00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,030
a paper and then they put a sign up in

00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,850
their window that said they cared and so

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:41,250
it affected change like how awesome is

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:43,020
that right so the community became a

00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,470
watchdog for those businesses our work

00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:49,920
was done all we did was say 30% and do

00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:53,460
the work but readers care more about the

00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,929
solution than the details then they want

00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:02,010
to know if there's a problem they can

00:29:54,929 --> 00:30:08,000
solve so as you how many of you already

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:10,470
have a list an email list okay about 10%

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,860
if you need a list we know somebody who

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:16,950
does mail chance just Sam so as you

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,000
build your lists and your lists are your

00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,580
people

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,830
your followers whether it's your list on

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,850
for a newsletter or social media video

00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:29,040
blog posts private groups on Facebook or

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,040
private groups on membership sites like

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:36,030
you can build lists in just about any

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,559
where you know shape at this point you

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:42,000
want to have a campaign that nurtures

00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:44,549
any new followers so that they can see

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,510
value in what you're offering so you're

00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:51,299
gonna send out emails you're gonna post

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,679
about things that deliver value and

00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,600
every once in a while you'll ask for a

00:30:52,679 --> 00:31:02,309
sale but that's not gonna be your

00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:05,070
primary focus because when we when we

00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:07,400
give of ourselves and give information

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,470
that we think that our audience wants

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,240
they listen to us a little more and they

00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:17,220
offer a little more to us and they come

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:21,150
back more frequently with our clients we

00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:25,200
try to keep dialogue very open we use

00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,570
email a lot and the more we use email it

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,550
seems the more they order and sometimes

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,169
we get to a client saturation level

00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,730
where we're just like okay we can't do

00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:34,210
anything more or we're gonna have to

00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,309
hire

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,520
and so we have to scale back those

00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:41,440
efforts for a little bit but because I

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,860
have a business that's been running for

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,980
almost six years we've learned to

00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,900
control that ebb and flow and to know

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,360
when we're gonna have a rush on

00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,100
something and to know when we need to

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,530
speed things up a little and so we can

00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:00,370
control that and for us sending out an

00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:04,030
email opens the floodgates so hope we we

00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:06,340
watch carefully what we're doing to make

00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,080
sure that we can keep things at an even

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:12,549
pace so we don't send out a lot of

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:18,400
emails but we do use email when we need

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:22,240
to we have lots of campaigns so I have a

00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,460
client who we did email for and we still

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,280
do but she does a monthly newsletter and

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:31,419
it has a calendar of events and it's

00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,039
unique to her local area and she's been

00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:38,049
doing it I think for years now we've

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:42,250
been putting that one out and two years

00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:43,690
into it she she always got emails back

00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,919
and people saying hey will you feature

00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:49,390
my event your calendar and she people

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,640
knew that she did it she got phone calls

00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,980
off of it it was great so there was a

00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,860
return on investment for that email

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,750
campaign we only sent it once a month

00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,580
but the biggest payoff was one day she

00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:04,720
was walking down her Main Street in her

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:07,929
town and somebody bumped in they saw her

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,030
and they said I know you and she was

00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:12,220
like what because she didn't recognize

00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:14,530
him they knew her from her newsletter

00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:17,830
because her picture was at the top and

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,840
they followed her event calendar so you

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,520
never know what influence you're gonna

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,929
have I think she told me that they

00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,840
eventually ended up listing a property

00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:28,870
with her so like it formed a friendship

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,039
because they already felt connected when

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:36,580
they saw her that first time in person

00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:37,840
and I have another client who when we

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,730
write blog posts for them

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,049
she always says hey we have some

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,399
customer requests can you write on this

00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:43,899
restaurant can you write on this new

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,520
shop that just opened can you write on

00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:47,290
it what

00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,380
she just calls us with all these

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:52,150
different ideas and so we're happy to

00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,710
take them we write up the post we

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,830
sometimes interview the client that

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,860
she's talking about and then what they

00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:02,710
do is sort of a synergistic approach

00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,360
she'll post to her blog and they shall

00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,730
post everything to her social media but

00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,730
she notifies that business my writers

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,960
went ahead and did a bio on you you may

00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,360
want to check it out well of course

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,190
they're gonna check it out right the spa

00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,200
shop wants everyone to know they exist

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,580
so they read it they love it and then

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,899
they post it on all of their social

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:25,899
media suddenly her sphere just got

00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:28,679
widened because now all of that person's

00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:30,730
clients have been to her website so

00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:35,050
that's another thing that we do that

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:36,700
seems to work really well and it's a way

00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,200
that you can combine audiences you don't

00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,450
have to do it with clients it could be

00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,730
your friends and you want to share your

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:45,370
friends product and they want to share

00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:48,540
yours but as you combine that you grow

00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:52,030
your individual audiences as well as

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,390
collaborating together okay so start a

00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:58,410
brand gimmick whether it's top 10 posts

00:34:55,390 --> 00:35:02,380
you've all heard of you know top 10 okay

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:04,180
or nine second videos you know people go

00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,070
on vine people go on Instagram do just

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,100
little video clips but it's something

00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:11,020
they become known for right calls to

00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,180
home I've seen people make calls to home

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:17,170
and that's like a YouTube thing weird

00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:20,320
but there's all kinds of options for

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:23,170
what you want to do my daughter is in

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,780
brand and web development she does

00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:28,120
design work and so she just got her

00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:32,400
degree and she called me and said hey

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,440
mom I was looking at your Instagram

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,840
she said you're really active on it

00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,160
which is good but it has nothing to do

00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,900
with your brand you just post whatever

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,240
you want and I'm like well yeah I'm

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:48,720
doing authenticity you know that's me

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:50,580
and she said we need to talk and so

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,200
she's she's actually coming down at the

00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,520
end of April and she's gonna be speaking

00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,260
at WordCamp Orange County so if any of

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,020
you are planning on attending that her

00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,740
name is Wrigley Ganaway and we should

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,510
Wrigley Ganaway

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,400
should totally plan on seeing her cuz

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,680
she's gonna be talking all about how to

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:10,170
make your brand better and she's using

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:13,200
me as an example it sounds like so but

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,120
she so I'm gonna take that coaching and

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,770
I'm gonna embrace it because she knows

00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,080
Instagram way better than I do she's in

00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:24,170
that generation I know you know we all

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:26,160
think we know it no she knows it so and

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,620
and there are people though who do

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,090
things with videos and so I was reading

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:35,730
a book called expert secrets by have any

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,670
of you heard of clickfunnels okay

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,920
clickfunnels is kind cool but the the

00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:43,320
guy who started that is named Russell

00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,270
Brunson and he wrote a book called

00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,820
expert secrets and in that he tells

00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:50,010
about his friend Jacob anyone already

00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:55,800
know this story okay I guess I'm telling

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:57,720
it okay so Jacob wanted to be able to he

00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,430
liked basketball but he couldn't dump it

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,010
no matter what he tried he couldn't jump

00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:05,850
high enough to dunk so he decided that

00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:07,920
he was going to make it a science out of

00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:10,200
it and he read everything he could find

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,780
for free on the internet and he started

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,700
videoing himself jumping and you know

00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,560
trying to do it and trying different

00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,080
techniques and seeing what worked and

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,240
what didn't work and he would just

00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,040
upload him to his youtube channel not

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,050
because he was trying to do anything

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:30,300
more than learn himself it was just him

00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:31,620
in his crazy video but after time he

00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,770
started to realize that people were

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,390
watching what he was doing he started to

00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:39,240
gain followers and then he gained more

00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,770
and he learned how to do it but

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,360
apparently there are a lot of people who

00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,810
want to know how to do that vertical

00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,990
jump and he made a business out of it

00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,030
has

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:51,270
millions of followers makes tons of

00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,890
money using the videos and the

00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,720
instructional stuff that he put together

00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:56,910
because it was something he wanted to

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,740
learn so it shows you you don't know

00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:02,040
what audience is out there you just need

00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:04,710
to do whatever it is that you do or want

00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,080
to do and people will come because

00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:10,560
someone is searching for whatever it is

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,570
that you wanted to do the I loved your

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,380
example I forgotten your name but I

00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,670
loved your example of the the hair

00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,080
because yes you you're getting emails

00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,290
from women all the time who are

00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:25,440
searching for a way to go gray naturally

00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,450
you know without stigma and feeling

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,940
comfortable I would never have thought

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,380
to search that up online but now that

00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,320
you've said them like I bet there are

00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:38,190
lots of people looking for that solution

00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:40,080
right so we're all in our own we all

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:44,160
have our own little world

00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,830
of what we are experts in and that is it

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,090
so start a brand gimmick about that one

00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,440
of the things Wrigley told me that we

00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:53,040
need to do for my brand is she's like

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,050
mom in your logo you have sunglasses you

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,130
should be using sunglasses and every one

00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,200
of your pictures if it's a picture of

00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,400
your desk sunglasses should be on it if

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,500
you're taking a picture of you skiing

00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,359
send the glasses should be like and

00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,100
I was like wow she's like if you get a

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,400
dog but some sunglasses on him you know

00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:13,830
and I thought that's so smart she is my

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,580
daughter so anyway so this you're not

00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,340
being fake

00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:19,200
you're just embracing your branding with

00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,359
your authenticity and you're combining

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,619
the two and that's really what you know

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,090
it doesn't have to start on a basketball

00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:26,280
court it doesn't have to start with

00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:29,400
sunglasses whatever it is that you are

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,350
is what it needs to be because it's the

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,680
people behind the business and the

00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:37,020
day-to-day operations who maybe you

00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,900
maybe your team and the consistent

00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:44,220
actions that you take that make your

00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,720
brand great and I promised you we'd get

00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:50,010
two reviews so I think we're getting

00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,200
close on time but we're gonna just go

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,740
through here okay this is a fire this is

00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,390
Santa Clarita Valley on fire okay

00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:01,289
because sometimes reviews you guys are

00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:04,319
not always the best right we help a lot

00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:07,500
of clients transform their Yelp profiles

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:11,490
so that they can have happy news at the

00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,529
top and so you need to listen to that

00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:15,420
feedback because a bad review isn't

00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:22,380
necessarily bad it just means you need

00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:24,630
to fine-tune and so whenever you you get

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,829
a review good or bad if it's good of

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,630
course you want to promote it you want

00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,609
to show it in a blog post you want to

00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,460
have something on your website that

00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:35,130
shows it share it in social media it's

00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,890
great to get a good review if it's a bad

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:40,500
review you want to step back and say why

00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,779
did I get this and undo those processes

00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,089
so that you can be true to what you want

00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:46,890
your branding to be I'm just gonna go

00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:49,589
over a few questions to make it easy for

00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:51,329
you to ask your clients things these are

00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:52,410
what we give to our clients when they

00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:55,769
say that they're gonna do a video

00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:57,750
testimonial or a written review I ask

00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:59,369
them to ask their clients what issue

00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:03,089
prompted you to call us in the first

00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:06,599
place so that they remember what it was

00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:09,839
that brought them there how did you feel

00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,130
before you ask for help so they get that

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,589
emotional thing going in that

00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:17,579
testimonial it's beautiful

00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:19,470
how was working with us different when

00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:23,730
did you realize the solution we

00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,990
suggested started working and then how

00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:29,640
did the solution change your business

00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:31,529
those five questions help people to be

00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,140
able to formulate a review that can

00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:38,339
really help you as your grow your

00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:41,250
content yes and you know what I can

00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:42,359
release them on Twitter too why don't I

00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,160
just do that because I think we're

00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:46,200
running short on time I don't want to

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,680
get okay I'm good I have five minutes

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:53,569
let's go okay question one what issue

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,569
prompted you to call us

00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,619
how did you feel before you ask for help

00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:08,500

how is working with us different when

00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:16,270
did you realize that the solution we

00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:18,390
suggested started working and then how

00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:21,609
did that solution change your business

00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:23,770
and you'd be amazed at what people say

00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:25,420
when they stop for a minute and think

00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,130

00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:30,280

00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,420
her like no you get the Jen Miller went

00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,230
through all the content on my website

00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,730
and changed things up in a way I didn't

00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,109
know I could do myself I had been

00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,730
worried and then I went to her and she

00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:43,030
solved all my problems that's a way

00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,099
better review right okay so so you're

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,319
giving your clients what you want them

00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:51,130
to give back to you and it just makes

00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:53,230
everybody's life easier with video you

00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,089
can give them these questions ahead of

00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,400
time and then if you are bringing them

00:42:55,089 --> 00:43:00,730
in to do a video testimonial for you

00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,140
then keep it conversational throw the

00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,609
questions in if you don't get the words

00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,800
exactly right just get the message

00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:06,880
across they'll answer cuz they'll

00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,119
remember because they looked at your

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,339
email beforehand and and we have clients

00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:14,920

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,400

00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:20,619
video testimonial and you can do it on

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,810

00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:28,810
just be authentic with it the more like

00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:32,079
lofty you get with testimonials and the

00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:33,790
more use big words and things the more

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,450
they're unrelatable so we don't want to

00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:38,800
do that allow real people to advise you

00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:41,260
so these people you're asking for

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:45,310
reviews the people who are in the office

00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:49,300
and extort you your grandma your uncle

your daughter ask them to give you their

00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:55,240
opinion because a marketing is a science

00:43:52,930 --> 00:44:01,329
but it's not only about the experts

00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:04,359
opinion it's about real people and I'm

00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:07,300
sure I was gonna give you all time to

00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:08,920
kind of like shout out but I think we're

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,740
not gonna have a chance but I'm

00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,980
sure you all have expert opinions that

00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,680
would build all of us because you've

00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:20,590
been in the world you see marketing on a

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,150
daily basis you see brands coming at you

00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:25,090
and you know what content works and what

00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:27,310
doesn't so talk amongst yourselves in

00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,200
little groups but the after party and

00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,330
learn from each other that's why we're

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,630

00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:36,880
like drone on and on we're here to build

00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:42,490
community and to learn from that

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:44,470
collective knowledge okay so make

00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:46,630
friends because you never know who is

00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:48,390
going to be a key influencer in your

life in your business in your community

00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:54,670
I told you about my first WordPress

00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:57,820
meetup but I didn't share why I stayed

00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:00,970
once I got there I stayed because I made

00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:04,060
friends some of those friends have

00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:07,900
become huge influencers in the WordPress

00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:10,510
community on a global basis some of

00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:13,270
those friends attended me or encouraged

00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:15,610
me to attend another Meetup called the

great group but there I met even more

00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,520
good friends and one of my good friends

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,670
was an expert at Twitter and her name is

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,410
Bridget Willard how many of you know her

00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:39,610
okay we have two people who know her you

00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:45,520
all should know Bridget

00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:49,030
she'll be at Orange County okay she left

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,200
her job after discovering WordPress she

00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,280
started coming to the WordPress meetup

00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:59,620
and after a year she left her job as a

00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:03,790
secretary and became a wordpress Twitter

00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:10,350
guru she just started in fact her her

00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:13,300
Twitter handle is at you too can be guru

00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:15,270
so you can ask me that later but she's a

00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,960
great person to follow because she knows

00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:22,000
things in and out and she has really

00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,780
just built herself up as an influencer

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,590
to many

00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:29,080
she helps lots and lots of businesses

00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:30,880
and I count her as a friend well as my

00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:35,170
friend she's helped me to build my

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:40,900
business and it's what friends do and

00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:42,580
it's why we have this community but I'm

00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,260
not just talking about follower content

00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:46,390
like with Brigid she's got tons of

00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,070
followers that's not the reason why I'm

00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,080
using her as an influence her I'm using

00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:52,570
her as an influencer or talking about

00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:55,540
her as an influencer because she's had

00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:58,450
influence on me and on my community and

00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:02,470
I've become better because of the people

00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:04,990
like her that I've met and my company

00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:08,590
has become better because of those types

00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:12,100
of people so whether you're involved in

00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:15,460
the community on or offline just get

00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:20,590
