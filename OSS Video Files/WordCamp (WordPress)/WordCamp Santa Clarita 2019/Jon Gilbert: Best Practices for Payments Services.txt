big welcome to John Gilbert hey guys I'm

00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,760
actually pretty new to the WordPress

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,980
space I don't know about you guys but

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,320
has anybody here been in the WordPress

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,439
community for less than a year in this

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,899
room awesome okay so you guys are kind

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,760
of in my boat too anybody who's been in

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,239
the WordPress community for longer than

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,550
five years that's awesome that's really

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,500
awesome so my journey into WordPress

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,289
started with a non-profit client that we

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,750
had you know they had mentioned that

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,280
they use this ecommerce platform called

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,440
WooCommerce which I knew nothing about

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,089
on a platform called WordPress which I

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,249
knew a lot about because I actually I

00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:58,710
did a little bit of blogging back in the

00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:11,550
day on only uh it was actually something

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:13,530
called blogspot I'm sorry anywho so it's

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,840
so I wanted to find out all I could

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,320
about WooCommerce because I learned that

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,380
it's the largest e-commerce platform in

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,509
the entire world 33% of all websites use

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,909
WordPress and so I had to learn more

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,890
about it and so I did a lot of reading I

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,869
wanted to find out you know what kind of

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,270
e-commerce platforms are on there what

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,310
kind of software is on there

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,990
what kind of merchant choose to use it

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,630
and what kind of resources are available

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,799
you know and learned it's open source so

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,539
you can really do anything that you

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,119
could possibly want but I went looking

00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:47,430
for articles on and I found you know

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,950
here's the best form builder here's the

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,390
here's the best e-commerce platform but

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,090
what I could never find is anything

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,789
about payments there's really no talk

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,320
about it at all I saw stripe at PayPal

00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:02,210
everywhere it's all a little bit of

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,939
authorized.net but it there's really

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,070
nothing about payments and two stripes

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,330
credit the the reason that there's not a

00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,810
lot of information about credit they

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,340
made it stupid easy to sign up it is so

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,800
incredibly easy to sign up for a stripe

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,700
count and get going but ignorance is

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,620
bliss but at the same time if you don't

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,820
know about the the wider world of

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,900
payments you really don't know what

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,730
you're missing out on

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,620
and and that's what I'm hoping to

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,709
educate people on today payments is

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,989
super complex but there's a few lessons

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,220
I can teach people like you like they

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,920
that can help you make a better decision

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,190
on the payment provided that you choose

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,489
and and why you might so what I'm mostly

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,049
going to talk about is is price and to

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,390
do that I'm gonna take you back a little

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,519
bit and I'm going to talk about a couple

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,019
of things is a brief history on credit

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:57,150
on online transactions how fees are

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,220
calculated and then once you get an

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,980
understanding of the components of a

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,140
transaction you can understand where you

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,459
can actually find better pricing that's

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,690
optimized for your business so you got a

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,970
lot to sit just to make when you build a

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,620
website you gotta find domain hosting

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,690
ecommerce platform

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,569
you gotta find all the plugins that

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,370
you're gonna use and usually by the time

00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,930
that you're ready to get your site up

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,440
and up and running payments as an

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,560
afterthought so how many people here

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,560
actually use a built their own website

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,220
or manage their own store ok and how

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:40,470
many of you people build stores for

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,690
other people all right so so obviously

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,329
like a lot of people like to hand off

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,799
their sites too because to stripe our

00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:48,419
PayPal because it's it's really easy

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
right you just need an email address and

00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,470
put in your address and plug in a few

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,169
things and you can hand it off but there

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,069
are a couple reasons that you should use

00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:59,579
potentially a couple different payment

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,470
providers one is because cost two is

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,410
because there are payment providers that

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,840
actually pay you to refer business to

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,760
them so a lot of people bundle and web

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,470
posting that you know they're selling

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,329
plugins that do certain things but

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,970
there's actually a lot of money to be

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,560
made by referring payments as well so so

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,299
finding the right provider can help you

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,669
get a little kickback when it when I was

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:24,360
watching the development track it word

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:26,580
Camp Miami lash just a just a month ago

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,800
you know I saw Chris lemma and and Jesse

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,199
talking about and and Jocasta Bonilla

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,340
talking about side hustles you know what

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,130
can you do to make a little extra money

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,450
well you can you can sell courses you

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,310
know you can bundle in web hosting

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,960
bundling site maintenance and so forth

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,880
but one of the easiest things is right

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,890
before your eyes just recommending a

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,450
payment partner can you can get a little

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,400
piece of every little transaction there

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,900
so I just wanted to bring that to

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,990
people's attention we'll come around to

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,330
this as well and we may get a little

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,910
kind of into the weeds here so if you

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,740
know if if your eyes are kind of rolling

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,330
back at all just raise your hand you

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,800
guys can ask questions you don't need to

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,180
ask you don't need to wait to the end

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,440
just raise your hand and I'll answer

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,540
your questions right away so first we're

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,580
going to talk about just kind of the how

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:17,770
credit evolves over the years about

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,500
4,000 years ago you had people farmers

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,570
who needed seeds to sow so they could

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,990
get crops and when they didn't have cash

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,270
on hand or any kind of denominations of

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,790
money they they had a one-on-one

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,110
relationship with a with an institution

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,460
that read that that says hey I'll give

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,900
you some seeds map but you got to give

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,470
me some some extra stuff once your

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,770
harvest is done right so and you know it

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,390
was about 4000 years ago I'm actually

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,820
what I learned from 23andme that I'm

00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,430
actually part Neanderthal and I actually

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,070
would argue that that my ancestors

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,840
thought of thought of lending a little

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,160
bit before that I have to I had to think

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,470
that one of my great great great great

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,820
great grand people was yeah I'll loan

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:03,550
you a rock but you gotta give me some of

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:05,020
that deer right so 4000 years pass or

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,430
20,000 years however you want to

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,280
calculate it not a lot to happen with

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,780
credit so I don't know if you guys watch

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,720
the little house in the Prairie when you

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,960
were younger but paw he wasn't always

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,700
cash heavy you know he had he always he

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,040
did the best for his family but you know

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,280
he he didn't always have cash this is

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,050
what he do he'd go to the mercantile and

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,450
he would and he set up a charge account

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,670
right and so he'd be able to buy a you

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,430
know a shovel or or whatever and at the

00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,380
end of the month on a credit this person

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,020
would you know he'd pay off his balance

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,170
and there's a one-on-one relationship

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,490
the the store merchants knew that pot

00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,050
wasn't going anywhere he knew where he

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,640
lived right he knew who his kids were

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,210
and so forth so there's always some

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,919
trust right and then fast forward to the

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,050
1900s

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,719
you know post-world War two there was a

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,879
big consumer boom right the economy was

00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:59,349
great everybody knew that when they

00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,599
started working that they were gonna

00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:03,310
make a little bit more money next year

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,050
than the year before everybody was

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,000
climbing the ladder living the American

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,289
dream and so credit started to change

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,810
instead of being a b2b type opportunity

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:14,889
you started seeing credit be lent to

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,469
consumers and so you had these

00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,169
Bloomingdale cards or your oil cards and

00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:21,789
eventually an airline card so these

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,069
cards would allow you to walk into a

00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,090
store purchase products and at the end

00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,460
of the month you could pay off your

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,650
balance right so there's it was a bit of

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,490
a closed-loop system but it still worked

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,169
you know and then eventually this guy

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,419
named John Biggins got an idea he was

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:39,219
like okay so you know people have these

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,129
charge cards and individual stores but

00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:43,659
I'm a banker I own a bank I have I have

00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,180
merchants at my bank and I have

00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:48,430
consumers at my bank so I'm gonna create

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,949
something called a charge it card and so

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,419
any member of Biggins bank could

00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,129
essentially attain one of these charge

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:56,169
of cards and use it at one of the

00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:58,389
merchants who was also a member of the

00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:00,879
bank and how it happened was at the end

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,650
of the month the business would tally up

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,779
all you know all the credits that are

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,279
due they would toss them over to big uns

00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,129
bank and then biggest banquet deduct

00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,139
that from the account and that was

00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,870
basically the first bank card there the

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:18,520
first issuer of any kind of card right

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:20,349
and and then payments really took a big

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,409
change because of this guy right here

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:28,449
does anyone know who this guy is no

00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:30,900
close his name was Frank McNamara and he

00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,560
was eating at a restaurant one day and

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,969
forgot his wallet

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,099
he's with a bunch of buddies and got

00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,570
really embarrassed he had to call his

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,250
wife and his wife came with the cash

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,769
and/or the checkbook I don't know what

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,930
it was but it's like this isn't I'm not

00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:47,620
doing this again and so he created

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:50,199
what's called the diners club and so he

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,959
got all of his friends 200 but his

00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:54,940
friends to pay a $5 annual fee to sign

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,250
up for this product and allowed them to

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,170
use a charge card at any participating

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,880
restaurant and so you could eat all over

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,290
New York City you know all the spaghetti

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,570
that he wanted to I think that spaghetti

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,730
that he's eating and

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,580
at the end of the month they had to pay

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:15,310
their bill so so it wasn't revolving

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:17,670
credit but it was it was credit then

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,680
came the cart Brants you had

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,270
BankAmericard the banks the banks were a

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,250
little bit limited for a while because

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,410
they were only able to extend credit to

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,890
certain regions right and so there's

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,800
this company called Bank car

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:34,030
BankAmericard and they had this great

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,620
idea they're like well we can only

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,590
extend credit to people in our region

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,630
but we had we just built these rails

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,790
essentially to allow other businesses to

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,950
accept cards and so what we're going to

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,570
do is we're gonna be able to license

00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,340
this product out to other banks and let

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,620
other banks sign merchants and so forth

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,450
and they end up getting so many

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,520
remittances and receipts to tally up

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,120
that they became too big and so they end

00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,640
up starting a company called Visa and so

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,770
Bank of America at Bank of America

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,020
eventually became Visa and so you had

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,960
all these different card brands and they

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:12,070
really fueled the innovation so you had

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,110
the Diners Club Card in 1946 in the 60s

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,450
you had the first plastic card then you

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,670
had magnetic strips then you had EMV

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,450
chips and then we had the mobile wallet

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,450
in 2008 so these guys are really the

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,280
these people are really the drivers of

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,900
you know of innovation and and they're

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,520
the ones who created essentially the

00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,900
network that we all use today and so to

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,480
go back a little bit at the same time

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,460
let's look at the first online

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,770
transactions the very first online

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,810
transaction happened 1972 between

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,480
Stanford and MIT on something called a

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,730
wrap net do you guys know what was

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,510
exchanged on the internet for this

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:56,740
transaction it was actually a gram of

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:58,390
weed the very first thing that was

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,870
exchanged on the internet was a gram of

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:05,280
weed so there you have it nice

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,380
yeah which is literally the hardest

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,660
thing to sell on the internet now today

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,160
right like if anyone has friends in that

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,590
business it's very hard to get an

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,760
account so then you had James James

00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,890
snowball you used something called the

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,400
video attacks to order provisions from

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,990
the store and the people came and they

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,340
delivered they delivered her the goods

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,790
and then she made the payment to them

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,320
and then which i think is also hilarious

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,860
the very first transaction that ever

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,970
happened was when someone added the

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,040
first time that someone actually put

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,750
their financial information into the

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,650
internet and bought something was for a

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,540
sting CD I just think that's awesome and

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,950
then in 2003 you got WordPress and so

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,430
that's kind of a little history of

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,500
online transactions today online

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,580
transactions are ever-evolving a little

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,400
bit more complex

00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,880
everybody knows what a website is or an

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,710
online location you know this this took

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,740
place is the storefront right and then

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:04,860
you have your shopping cart ecommerce

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,330
platform which really does the brunt of

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,430
the work for your transactions right

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,350
it's it's cataloging your information

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,050
it's helping you price price your

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:16,260
products it's it's enabling you know

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,000
someone to check out it's it's saving

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,450
shipping information saving customer

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,030
information it's doing a ton and then

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,430
you get a payment gateway payment

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:30,470
gateway is what actually authorizes and

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:32,130
captures the transaction okay so

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,530
authorized.net is a payment gateway

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,420
hence the name they authorize captured

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,450
they're also the ones who are encrypting

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,950
the data they're the ones who are

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,500
tokenizing the data so that the

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,990
merchants can use the customer info

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,630
again securely so they can call instead

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,850
of saving a credit card on a you know on

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,970
a spreadsheet or whatever it's just

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:58,640
sharing the customer ID and so all that

00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:00,990
information is is saved for future use

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,910
and you get a merchant account the

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,990
merchants the people all think that the

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,190
merchant account in the payment game

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,320
worried the same thing they're not

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,940
they're completely different a merchant

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,060
account is actually a business account

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,490
that a business gets in order to deposit

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,610
funds and into their bank account the

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,440
merchant account is essentially

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:23,960
what allows you it it's who determines

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,150
what you're paying for transactions how

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:33,310
much money you can actually transact in

00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:33,310
a month and what products you can sell

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,000
so this is basically how a transaction

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,430
works and when I was talking about

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,570
before when we're talking about pas and

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,670
the merchants and the Diners Club Card

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,710
the entire credit card economy works

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:52,850
because there's checks and balances

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:55,070
right in in order to to have a credit

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,750
card a consumer needs to go to a card

00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,910
issuing bank and have their credit run

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,440
right then you can do your told yeah you

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,850
can process five thousand dollars a

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,490
month ten thousand dollars a month

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,200
whatever it is the same rules go for an

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,880
acquiring bank and so the acquiring

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,220
banks are who actually give merchants

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,410
the ability to process funds and so

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,520
these card brands they're setting the

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,380
rules for both of these organizations to

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,150
follow so they're setting the rules for

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,820
how much the consumers can spend but

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,950
they're also they're also saying you

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,280
know in order to process funds you need

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:30,800
to have XY and Z done on your website

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,750
you also only these products and

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,280
services are allowed and so forth and so

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,070
they're setting the rules but when you

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,750
go on your website the consumer

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,240
purchases something with the software

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,990
again that's doing most of the work the

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,400
merchant account and payment gateway are

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,560
they're authorizing the transaction

00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,690
there they're basically going yep does

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,240
this does this card person have this

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,160
cardholder has the the available funds

00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,370
yes it does and then the information

00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,020
goes back and so that's how a

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,550
transaction works and so now I'm just

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:06,020
going to tell you guys about the two

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,760
players involved in four merchant

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,560
essentially that the the two the two

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,630
different ways that you can accept funds

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:16,820
as a business you basically have a

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,830
payment aggregator and a merchant

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,160
account does anyone know who what a

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,250
payment aggregator is payment aggregator

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,290
is what's stripe Pay Pal and square R

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,889
yeah and so they're not they're actually

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,139
not a merchant account there

00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:33,389
they are software that allows you to

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,149
accept funds without being a merchant

00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:38,819
and so they take a lot of responsibility

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:42,209
for you and and they make things very

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:43,949
simple a merchant account is this is

00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,660
they have easy signup simple to

00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:47,459
understand rates the great full of

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,009
volume and they're ubiquitous you've

00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:51,989
seen stripe everywhere right but there's

00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,160
also some caveats with this you know

00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:55,769
when you sign up for a payment

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,809
aggregator there's nobody who's who's

00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:59,699
checking your website really there's the

00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:03,089
you have some very limited business

00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:05,040
information and so this what it is is

00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,660
stripe is acting as a very large

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,730
merchant and they're allowing a bunch of

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,290
other people to come on - basically

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,669
borrow their merchant account it's kind

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,619
of like the difference between shared

00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:17,249
hosting and dedicated hosting right if

00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:19,230
you just need like a you know if you're

00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:21,959
not really worrying about overhead and

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,579
so forth you can you can absolutely you

00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,929
know get a shared account a merchant

00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,279
account is a little bit more serious

00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:28,949
it's actually like signing up for a

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,989
business account ok so so a merchant

00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:33,360
account provider there they need because

00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:35,970
they're acquiring bank has to follow

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,470
laws and so when you apply for one not

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,329
only do they have to follow Visa and

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,730
MasterCard policies but they are they

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:44,790
have to follow financial regulations

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,739
like anti money laundering laws the Bank

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:50,129
Secrecy Act the Patriot Act so they need

00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:53,189
to make sure that a business is who is

00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:55,139
applying for a merchant account is not

00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:55,799
wanted you know they're not on the OFAC

00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,970
list

00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,499
they haven't been caught money

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,079
laundering or so forth they're also

00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:03,089
making sure that you know the website

00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,230
you know that they're selling what

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,839
they're saying they're selling you know

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,669
like making sure that if you know if

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,230
they're opening a t-shirt shop they're

00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:11,399
gonna check the website that you know

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,559
the website is actually selling t-shirts

00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:16,079
and not guns or drugs right and so

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,399
there's the so generally when you're

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,380
applying for a merchant account you need

00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:21,419
to be you need to be able to supply your

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,039
driver's license your business license

00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,600
and then they're also going to make sure

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,519
that you have terms and conditions on

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,820
your website a refund policy and so

00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,529
forth so it's a little bit extra work

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,450
but you know there's a one on one

00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:35,309
relationship there's some trust here and

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,350
so the the merchant account provider

00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:38,760
understand your business they understand

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,090
the volume that they need and so what

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,830
they can also do is give you a bigger

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,529
bigger amount of volume to process per

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,000
month so usually with stripe there

00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:50,039
they're throwing a bunch of people under

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,080
the account knowing that no one's you

00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,000
know that 70% of their customers aren't

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,390
going to process and then when certain

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,159
customers start to spike in volume they

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,260
may hold their funds and say okay okay

00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,520
okay you just you just process $15,000

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,929
in a month we need to hold your funds

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,279
for a week and what we're gonna ask you

00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,779
some additional information you know

00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,020
they do the underwriting a little bit

00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:11,309
later so if you know if you're if you

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,120
have a serious business you got to do

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:17,880
some volume you do it probably behooves

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,529
you to to take care of these you know

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,470
underwriting questions beforehand but

00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:24,990
most providers also merchant providers

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,850
also have more advanced reporting like

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,669
being able to chain multiple companies

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:38,899
to want to count hierarchal access for

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:38,899
reporting and affiliate programs yes

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:48,370
there are certain circumstances where

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:51,700
you can piggyback on a organizational

00:18:48,370 --> 00:19:06,910
rate it's already been negotiated with

00:18:51,700 --> 00:19:08,590
that bank or all lutely yes you can you

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,110
can negotiate it's kind of like you know

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:15,340
with your you know with your your phone

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:17,350
company or with your your your internet

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,910
provider right like like you know that

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:22,840
if you call them enough you can get your

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:24,850
rates lower down and generally you know

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,770
like banks they have negotiator ranks

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,290
with merchants providers and so so

00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,940
someone who does you know like a web

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,470
designer can do the same thing they can

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,960
you know they can they can sign up for

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,030
an affiliate program with an acquiring

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,370
bank and say I want to offer this

00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,440
pricing to my customers and and usually

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:46,930
have agreed-upon rate and you offer that

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:50,620
to your customers and so the difference

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,210
between the fees here is that when

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,060
you're using someone like stripe or

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,310
PayPal or square they have card brand

00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,170
fees to pay they have dues and

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,090
assessments to pay they have merchant

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,800
acquirer fees and gateway fees but

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,320
they're taking all these fees and then

00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,360
they're just charging you one flat

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,280
easy-to-understand rate and so if you're

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,570
doing very low volume it's nice to know

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,270
that if I do a hundred dollar

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,560
transaction it's gonna cost the same

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:18,160
every single time I do it doesn't matter

00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:21,690
what card types I accept okay but the

00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,040
card bread fries are actually where

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:27,010
they're actually the most dynamic okay

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,540
so everybody has a debit card in their

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,160
wallet I'm sure everybody has an

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,130
Airlines card and maybe some of you guys

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:38,230
have a corporate card right debit cards

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:42,120
actually cost 0.05 percent and 20 cents

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,770
for processors like us to process okay

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,580
these are signature debit cards cost one

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:51,250
point six five percent and so the actual

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,620
pricing methodology that you use kind

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,370
determines how you pay these rates or if

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,110
you actually paid

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,260
it's written a little bit more detail in

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:02,230
a second with a merchant account

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:05,590
generally you're paying all you're

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,000
paying these four rates separately okay

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,470
there you're getting you're getting

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,990
billed for for everything as opposed to

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,940
all at once and it's you know one of the

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,890
examples I use is and I'll get this

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,890
later is it's it's like basically eating

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:24,280
a salad bar

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:26,350
so pricing methodologies just to kind of

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,960
get past the last bit of boring stuff

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,910
here flat rate pricing you guys are all

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,770
you guys all know what that is right two

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,150
point nine thirty cents merchant

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,160
providers can also offer this pricing

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,710
too but if you're gonna go through the

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,480
work and get a merchant account you

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,190
should actually do what's called

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,290
interchange plus pricing which is kind

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,730
of like wholesale pricing you know

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,670
you're getting charged for everything

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,470
separately and there's some threshold

00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:53,170
site that you can use to actually help

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,790
you decide whether this is a good

00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,559
decision for your business or not okay

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,230
so whether flat rate prices are going to

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,240
change plus pricing there are a couple

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,920
different you know variables kind of

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,900
come into play it's who your customers

00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,420
are how much you know how much volume

00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,540
are you running on your account okay and

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:16,809
and also maybe how much of all you need

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:18,970
and what you're selling so with with

00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:20,500
stripe it's they they're paying or with

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,120
most merchant providers they're paying

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,440
you a what's called a discount rate

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,120
which is basically it's mele it's the

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,250
case it's how much the card cost right

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,770
and so stripe gives you a discount rate

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,780
of two point nine percent no matter what

00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,520
the card type is two point nine percent

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,200
every single time and then they also

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,840
charge you a per transaction or an

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,850
authorization fee so every time you

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,950
authorize a card they're charging you

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:48,460
thirty cents plus two point nine percent

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,890
times the transaction amount so if we

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:55,179
look here this is a hundred dollar

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:57,100
transaction with stripe or PayPal as you

00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,500
can see here these are all the different

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,970
card brands right here or

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,830
I took this chart based on the firm from

00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,320
Visa MasterCard and discover these are

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:08,260
the most common card types used on b2c

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,240
transactions and as you can see here

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,000
there are what's called interchange fees

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,620
this is the card this is how much Visa

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,809
MasterCard these card issuers are

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,809
charging for the card so world elite

00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:21,400
cards as you can imagine big money you

00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:22,929
need you need to have a special kind of

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,549
credit to have one of these cards but

00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:27,940
usually those transactions are a lot

00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:29,559
larger to rewards cards right if you

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,289
ever wondered you know how you're

00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,030
getting your airline miles your

00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:38,380
merchants paying for that actually so

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:42,039
you're welcome and then you've also got

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,659
Visa Durbin and MasterCard debits so

00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,460
these are just like these are the cards

00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,320
that are connected to your directly to

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,460
your bank account right everybody has

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,610
one of these like from their from their

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,900
local credit union and this is what's

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:57,159
really interesting so look how much you

00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,159
there's quite a bit of variance between

00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,020
these card types right but if your what

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,070
if your with stripe or PayPal doesn't

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,630
matter what kind of card type you're

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,309
getting charged it's three dollars and

00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,470
20 cents for every single hundred-dollar

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:12,220
transaction right it doesn't matter if

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,419
the card cost 0.05 percent you know one

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,940
point six five percent or whatever

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,080
you're getting charged the same rate

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,110
conversely if you're with a merchant

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,700
provider what they're gonna do is

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,159
they're gonna say you have to pay them

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,630
whatever the card type is you have to

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,789
pay the dues and assistance which is

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,409
basically the cost of the rails right

00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:31,750
the network that's actually being

00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:33,580
provided for people and also helping the

00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,530
research and development for new

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,169
products and services like EMV and stuff

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,669
but what they're gonna do is they're

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,900
gonna quote you with something called

00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:46,600
interchange plus and so the plus is what

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,460
the markup is over interchange so

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,169
usually a merchant provider will say

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,260
we're gonna charge you interchange plus

00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:57,100
a half a percent which means whatever a

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,450
wholesale cost of of the card and the

00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,580
dues and assessment you're gonna pay

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:04,830
plus the same markup and so your

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:07,990
transaction cost looks like this now

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:10,090
this really this information really

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,300
doesn't mean a whole lot if there isn't

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,700
put into context because

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:20,190
do you know which cards are actually the

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:22,650
most prevalent visa mastercard visa

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:26,370
debits if you're selling a product that

00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:31,130
cost under $100 70% of all transactions

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:34,020
are Visa debit cards so 70% of all all

00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:37,110
b2c transactions are on debit card and

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:42,060
they cost less than a percent to process

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:43,410
so a lot of it depends on you know who

00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,270
you're selling to you write business

00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,340
cards cost a little bit more as we can

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,310
see here so if you're selling direct to

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,750
businesses there's also certain things

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,910
you can do to lower those costs as well

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,800
but this is what you need to figure out

00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,680
as a merchant is you know merchant

00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,990
providers they they have some set fees

00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,890
right they have usually a monthly fee a

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:06,480
PCI fee a gateway fee some may roll them

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,000
all into one you know you can but you

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,460
can probably pay you know $10 a month or

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,410
$35 a month and fixed cost those are

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,690
monthly costs above the transaction so

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,060
where's that break-even point here right

00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,550
well generally when you're working with

00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,170
the merchant provider with interchange

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,670
plus pricing your average transactions

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,560
going to be around two point one to two

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,840
point three percent so it's really just

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,850
a math equation now so if I know I'm

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,520
getting you know a point eight percent

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,000
discount all these transactions how much

00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:38,160
volume do I need to run to offset the

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,290
cost of you know those fixed fees like

00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:45,600
the gateway fees and so forth and again

00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,910
this is just a chart to kind of show you

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,810
the prevalence of debit cards which are

00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:53,490
insanely cheap to process and also the

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,660
future of cards you know in the past

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,210
fourteen years

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,970
debit has has raised three hundred

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:05,660
seventy one percent for MasterCard six

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:10,530
hundred percent for Discoverer so and

00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,970
200 percent for visa so debit cards are

00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,620
super prevalent they're getting more

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,140
prevalent and they're really cheap to

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:20,090
process so that's really all I'm trying

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:23,440
to to show you guys here and so here's

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:26,050
basically using the same data

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,120
here's basically kind of the break-even

00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,610
points here so if you're with a merchant

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,860
provider and you're running zero dollars

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:34,420
a month well you have cost and so

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,920
payment under gator is gonna be way

00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,450
cheaper if you're just running a couple

00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,100
couple transactions a month you should

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,290
be with the payment aggregator probably

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,820
if if prices really is all you're

00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,020
thinking about there's certain features

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,240
you can get with the merchant account

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,480
provider you can't get with with stripe

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,000
or with PayPal but 2,000 dollars a month

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,290
you can see here still a little bit more

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,690
expensive but once you start getting

00:27:53,290 --> 00:28:00,700
around 5,000 10,000 $15,000 $20,000 the

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,460
fixed fees aren't weighted so high now

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,830
right so then conversely also if you

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,330
have merchants who are running twenty

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,790
thousand dollars a month in transactions

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,440
a merchant provider is gonna be paying

00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:14,350
you around point one percent two point

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,150
two percent of transactions so $20,000

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,640
merchants can make you you know

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,410
anywheres between forty and a hundred

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,360
dollars a month that's just extra cash

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,370
in your pocket you're doing them a favor

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,400
by hooking them up with their provider

00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:30,190
so you're just from a cost perspective

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:34,060
that's kind of a bird's eye view of

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:37,120
payments someone review a payment

00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,160
aggregator is a lot like when you go to

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,300
Whole Foods right you're you know I just

00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,400
want a meal for myself

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,070
I'm gonna grab I'm cool grabbing some

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,050
lettuce some chickpeas some onions and

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,390
so for it knowing it's all $7.99 a pound

00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,530
like I don't want to buy you know a

00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,480
whole thing a little whole head of

00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,340
lettuce a whole pepper a whole whole

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,510
bottle of olive oil right I just want to

00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,060
get a little bit of each nut and I'm

00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,890
okay paying a little bit higher fee for

00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,210
every transaction because there's you

00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:04,270
know I don't want to walk away with an

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,920
entire salad so but merchant account is

00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,600
you know basically you're you're you're

00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,920
making a salad for a family right you're

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,080
not you're not going to hit the salad

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,540
bar up for $7.99 and get a bunch of

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,980
chickpeas for your family you know when

00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,630
they win the win they away a ton so

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,950
you're gonna go buy a head a letter so

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,750
you're gonna buy some Tomatoes a green

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,740
pepper and some olive oil and so forth

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,450
so that's really the difference it's you

00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,980
know and there are a lot of great

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,510
platforms out there but from a cost

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,510
perspective you know the questions you

00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:35,320
should really ask yourself in selecting

00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:37,210
a partner is aside from the cost or you

00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,070
know is the provider integrated with

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,200
where that I want to use a striper

00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,399
PayPal they probably are right because

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,140
they're integrated with everything

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,500
authorized done that's the same thing to

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,940
you know that there's a lot of they were

00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,919
one of the first to integrate to

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,710
WordPress and so as a lot of lot of

00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,140
plugins there what features do they

00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,450
provide right

00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,770
when will I receive my deposits do you

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,480
want you to pause this in a week or do

00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,070
you want your posit in a couple days a

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,130
merchant provider is gonna give you your

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,049
money faster because they've already

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,149
mitigated risk by underwriting your

00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,380
company so they know the volume that

00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:13,929
you're going to do they know what you

00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,720
sell some of these payment aggregators

00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:17,710
they need to hold money because they

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,690
don't really know what you're doing for

00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,179
a business there isn't that that that

00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,620
merchant paw relationship like like

00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:26,080
little house in the prairie they don't

00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,970
know anything about you what kind of

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,770
reconciliation reporting is available

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,330
the reconciliation reporting is pretty

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:35,140
important if you're a non-profit right

00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,470
if you have donations you want to be

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,840
able to separate your transaction fees

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:42,880
from for from your income right and so

00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,279
look for a provider that can provide

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,909
this reporting for you can they work

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:51,909
with my business type right a lot of you

00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:55,929
know there's what's considered low risk

00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:57,340
and high risk merchants and and usually

00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,630
the aggregators are not working what the

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,220
high risk providers you hear from a lot

00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:03,100
of people who are like oh yeah I started

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,630
running CBD on my song CBD oil on my

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,309
site and I was shut down after a week

00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,450
you know well if you want to apply for a

00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:09,100
merchant provider they were just told

00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,340
you know rap the bat or just told you

00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,600
who to contact so but but also like do

00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,370
they have an affiliate program an

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,169
affiliate program could be beneficial

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,159
for a couple different ways one it's

00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:22,090
paying you but two they can you

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,350
emergency a provider is gonna be happy

00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,250
for the referrals that sending you so

00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,990
they're gonna give you a more

00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,730
white-gloved approach they're going to

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,049
if you're working with the merchant

00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,700
authority of processing they can do

00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:32,950
what's called a cost savings analysis

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:36,429
and so they can see the rates that

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:38,350
you're getting and they can cut you a

00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:39,580
better deal you know like a merchant cut

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,720
provided they're thanking you for

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,159
getting the business they don't have to

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,020
advertise you're bringing it straight to

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,389
them and so it's in their best interest

00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:50,110
to make it as easy as possible to sign

00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:52,030
up and before you know

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,440
ten years ago it was a pain in the butt

00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,100
to sign up for a merchant account I'm

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,410
not gonna lie

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,210
get a fax fax stuff back and forth there

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,630
was an ugly process and one of the

00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:03,250
reasons that stripe and PayPal became

00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,210
you know such big players so quick is

00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,310
that they made it painless

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,740
well most merchant account providers

00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,410
have smartened up and now they have API

00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:14,640
based onboarding material they have you

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:17,440
know their REST API base as well so

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,100
that's essentially that's essentially it

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,300
guys in a nutshell so if you guys have

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,510
any questions I'd be happy to answer

00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,510
them

00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:33,460
[Applause]

00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:35,200
yeah it's it really it really depends on

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,590
your individual business really I mean

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,000
like you know I I can't really say which

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,670
would we no one's better than the other

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,670
per se you know you want to it really

00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:51,160
depends on what you're doing if you run

00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,930
a lot of transactions it's better to do

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,310
what's called interchange Plus which is

00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:58,180
a more optimized way of of paying for

00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,130
essentially paying for the card types

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,720
that you're accepting so yeah I'm

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,480
merchant account provider can definitely

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,300
be cheaper you know if you're crossing

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,610
that threshold of $5,000 a month that's

00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:13,930
that's the break-even point yeah just

00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:17,610
talking about yeah interchange plus or

00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:19,950
cost plus pricing right that is the

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,300
opposite of stretch stripe is flat rate

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,160
one-size-fits-all pricing doesn't matter

00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,080
what card type you say and interchange

00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,360
plus is variable pricing based on the

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,360
cards that you accept Jesse

00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:55,349
do not challenge service writers have

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,729
the ability to look at I don't know when

00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:59,849
our customer gives us their credit card

00:33:56,729 --> 00:34:03,479
is what if it's a Visa debit for it yeah

00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:06,599
that's interesting isn't it yeah so you

00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:11,399
don't know and so so they're not giving

00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:13,980
you that data right so it so you can't

00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,929
so usually if you know if someone's with

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,389
authorize.net like any merchant provider

00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,369
has like this card type this card type

00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,770
this card type you know stripe doesn't

00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:23,609
and so what what we can do is kind of a

00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:27,119
little detective work

00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:30,000
we know the trends we know like based on

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,339
what your transaction amount is and who

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,169
your customers are what the mix of cards

00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:36,000
is so you're I would imagine you being

00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:39,119
an agency you're probably accepting a

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,809
lot of business cards right and business

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,599
cards are inherently much more expensive

00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:49,309
those can cost from 2.2 percent all the

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:53,669
way up to 2.8 percent and and so and

00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:55,649
that's before the markup so if you so

00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:58,829
one thing you can do in order to lower

00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:01,680
these interchanges so Tier four business

00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:03,480
cards are or anything that's a so it's

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,380
basically the businesses approved for

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,839
twenty five thousand dollar payments so

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,849
just because that is risky you know as

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,010
you know as Visa MasterCard offering

00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:16,349
someone the ability to run transactions

00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:20,039
that that expensive they're charging the

00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:22,230
merchant a much higher rate and so but

00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,510
Visa Mastercard Discover all these card

00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,609
brands they're willing to lower that

00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,010
interchange rate if the merchant account

00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:30,569
provider can pass additional data along

00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,910
the transaction so they're looking for

00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:34,740
purchase order number you know item

00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,569
weight and so forth so if you can work

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,789
with the provider this is called level

00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:40,619
two and level three data so the good

00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:42,809
merchant providers and the good gateways

00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:44,339
can pass along this info and that two

00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:48,210
point eight charge goes down to two

00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:49,740
point two so so you see there's

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,210
potential and also you know if a

00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,890
merchant account provider wants your

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,630
account bad enough they'll just give you

00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,010
a you know they'll know that like you

00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,299
know your rates two point nine so they

00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,190
got a beat that's a little harder well

00:35:57,299 --> 00:36:00,720
maybe this person just gets instead of a

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,530
half percent markup we're just going to

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:24,840
do

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:26,940
you know 0.25% markup yeah yeah exactly

00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,220
so that usually the more volume that you

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,130
run you know the more negotiating power

00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,780
that you have yeah absolutely and and

00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,300
then that's the other important thing

00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,580
right is having verifiable transaction

00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,190
history and so the good thing about

00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,440
doing interchange plus is that when you

00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,970
go to your next provider to negotiate

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,530
your rate they know all your card types

00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,870
they can say okay now I know what this

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:51,270
is gonna cost you but usually again like

00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:53,220
the card types are variable so those are

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,200
always changing both the mark-up is what

00:36:53,220 --> 00:37:01,230
you're negotiating for and and you

00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:06,870
definitely have negotiating power yep

00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:10,430
you can yep now the one thing that that

00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:12,660
you just want to make sure of is that

00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:16,560
it's gonna take away some of your volume

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,910
right and so but you know American

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,410
Express transactions cost a little bit

00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,180
more so you know if you're paying with n

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,470
max off or stripe you know if you're

00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,090
gonna pay with debit card using the

00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,890
merchant account you know or something

00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,750
like that and and a lot of people also

00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,490
do PayPal buttons right because PayPal

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,710
is play money right if I have ten

00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,000
dollars in my PayPal account I don't

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,680
want my wife to know I bought a t-shirt

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,910
you know because I was supposed to go to

00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,880
groceries or something you know I'm

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:44,600
using my PayPal account so two point

00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,600
nine thirty cents

00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,230
well I mean that's up that's up to you I

00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:00,480
mean like it's the same with like

00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,319
offering web hosting or whatever you

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,279
know like people white label stuff

00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:07,220
usually just say hey this is what this

00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:09,630
is my preferred provider you know and

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,920
like but make sure that your customer is

00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,480
gonna get something out of it right it

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,250
needs to be a win-win-win for it to work

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,990
you don't want just to refer someone you

00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,849
know if you have a software company you

00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,890
know like if I'm easy digital downloads

00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:21,779
like you know I want to partner with a

00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,069
provider and give and send everyone to

00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:24,839
that provider because I know I'm gonna

00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:26,400
make some money but like make it worth

00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,750
their while to give them a low rate

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,549
that's going to lower their transaction

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:36,589
costs like you can have a win-win-win

00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:36,589
scenario exactly yeah you can be exactly

00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:47,099
yeah and that's another great thing too

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:49,559
cuz because you have big commerce their

00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,029
payment agnostic have a bunch of payment

00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:54,210
providers on there pick pick whatever

00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:55,260
one you want you know then you have

00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,119
someone like Shopify

00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,619
where they just have Shopify payments

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,630
now so they went to a merchant acquirer

00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:03,029
they applied for their own acquiring

00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,130
license and became a retail basically

00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:07,170
like a retail shop and today white-label

00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:09,119
the solution and if you've ever looked

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,880
at Shopify as annual statements from the

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,220
last six years there is a gigantic jump

00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,400
in revenue you know once once they got

00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:20,400
everyone to to use their payment service

00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,200
provider and again like as long as you

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,730
can make it so so that people have the

00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,490
features that they need and you know

00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,079
like people a lot of times I feel want

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,029
to be recommended it to a solution they

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,289
don't want to do you know all the

00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:36,270
research themself and so you know a lot

00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:38,039
like a lot as long as you're you know

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,990
you're solving solving their problems

00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,579
right and helping the lowering their

00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:45,349
fees and giving them the features they

00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,349
need I think I think you're okay

00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:50,029
what

00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,299
what would you what advice would you

00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:55,309
give or change if instead of a

00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:58,849
transaction happening one second

00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:08,029
recurring transaction like every month

00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:10,160
you know so I would get so I would for a

00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:12,140
policy perspective never make the

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,749
recurring payment period longer than a

00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,009
year that's that's a big no-no at Visa

00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:18,319
MasterCard they don't want to see any

00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:22,519
kind they want to see your yearly

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:25,519
renewals essentially and then like you

00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,680
know some payment providers can also you

00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,609
know they have their own recurring

00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,069
recurring engine you know within

00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:32,720
WooCommerce my company has a free

00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:35,869
subscription product that we that we

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,039
just give away as a plug-in but if you

00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:40,130
want to use something like woo

00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:42,109
subscriptions or membership manager Pro

integrates at that platform so you know

00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:51,230
you don't want to like it it's get

00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,579
someone set up and then find out that it

00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:55,269
doesn't even work with the platform that

00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,269
they're using right

00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:15,680
these are deep offers does subscriptions

00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:19,430
your yes yep yes yes there absolutely is

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,480
in right now so we have our own merchant

00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,539
account where we're a merchant account

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,809
provider and a gateway we've we've

00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:28,039
connected to our gateway to the most

00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:30,589
most requested products we're not

00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:33,049
connected to everything but in the case

00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:35,990
well we're not you know connected to

00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:38,240
what does not a quality software

00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,519
connection like with Woo's subscriptions

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:55,759
you can use authorize.net and connect

00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:57,940
that to our merchant account so no I'm

00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:57,940
not

00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:10,359
to the residences president teleporters

00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:13,619
and within ten days like 90% of the

00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:16,619
population of Fresno was only juicy

00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,619
BankAmericard

00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:21,630
it was that's interesting

00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:51,240
that's hilarious I mean what when I went

00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,590
to college my I got my first Bank of

00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,770
America quarter card cuz I got a free

00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:57,090
t-shirt it was like and I still have

00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:07,710
that credit card today it's a good job

00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:09,660
guys yeah really and thank you for

00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:25,290
pronouncing it correctly because I

00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:29,280
certainly wasn't yeah go to the bank we

00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:31,110
also offered the program as well so yeah

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,730
just just just look up payment you know

00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:35,970
payment referral program again like when

00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,290
you're looking at this stuff like just a

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,990
word of advice a lot of you know people

00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,970
who have authorized.net you know bass

00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:44,000
software they can sign up for an

00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,650
affiliate program directly with them I

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,320
recommend finding the merchant provider

00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,300
first and cut out the the middle person

00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,280
because authorize.net is just making a

00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,720
deal with the bank who's then paying

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,640
them and they're paying the referral

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,120
part you can cut that middle person out

00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,120
so

00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:15,380
absolutely everything's on the table yep

00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:20,040
yeah we're your your payment provider

00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,300
should be your partner

00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,010
like they should understand what your

00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,470
goals are what your customers goals are

00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:27,960
and yeah you are making the money and

00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:29,910
also a lot of times or every single time

00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,740
actually an affiliate program you're

00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:33,570
getting paid off with the profit so they

00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,780
don't care if you're charging a $30

00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,280
monthly fee or a $5 monthly fee it's all

00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,750
getting calculate at the end of the

00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,760
month and so they're splitting you a

00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,550
percentage of the net revenue so I mean

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,960
they just they want the business I mean

00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,370
obviously they'd like you to charge as

00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,990
much as possible so there's more revenue

00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,860
to share but you got a lot of

00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,860
negotiating power

00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:04,170
yes it depends it depends who you're

00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:07,080
using in dip sorry and it depends and it

00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:09,060
depends on depends on who you're using

00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,310
in a lot of times it depends on the

00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,630
process some merchant providers will

00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:15,450
allow you to submit an application

00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:18,990
without supporting documentation and you

00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:20,700
can get approved on reserve which is

00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,320
basically like 100% hold back where you

00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,300
can run transactions but you can't take

00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,400
your money out until you supply those

00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,290
documents because a bank they need to do

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,310
due diligence they need to they need to

00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,750
your voided check they need your

00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,240
driver's license they need your business

00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,760
license and so forth but good providers

00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,190
can do it in the same day or 24 hours

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,710
you know depending on your merchant type

00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:42,810
I mean yeah there's a couple that can be

00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,850
that can be you know if you're like a

00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:47,790
vacation club or something you know and

00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:49,920
it's you know and there's a large risk

00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:51,900
of exposure you know of charge backs and

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,410
so forth that might be a little harder

00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,730
to underwrite because you know the more

00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:58,350
confusing your business model is right

00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,340
like they will they want to be able to

00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,750
say hey what are your terms and

00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,950
conditions what happens if someone buys

00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,450
this you know they want to make sure

00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,850
that you have your refund policy on your

00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:08,220
site and so forth but you know if you're

00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,090
trying to get a you know a pyramid you

00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,560
know they want to make sure that you're

00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,880
not offering a pyramid scheme and so

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,740
forth and so there's really just a bunch

00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,450
of checks and balances that you are who

00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:18,359
you say you are your business is selling

00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:21,359
what you should be you know and also

00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:23,640
that your your your DD ADA scripture the

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,800
thing descripted the thing that actually

00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,260
shows up on your consumers credit card

00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,070
statements matches up with what your

00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,070
businesses but

00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:39,560
yeah four thousand yeah I'd say yep

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,560
absolutely

00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:58,740
yeah I mean a lot of time it's a good

00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,970
idea to get your merchants running first

00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,290
so you're right because like you know

00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,640
like everybody thinks they're gonna run

00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,650
ten thousand dollars a month when they

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,080
set up their website right and then and

00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,580
then what happens so so yeah so so using

00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,870
a payment aggregator like stripe or

00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,120
PayPal for those first couple months

00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,580
really is a good way to kind of you know

00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,680
because what happens if they run $200 a

00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,150
month or $1500 a month like they don't

00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,340
have to you know then I've had that

00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,510
monthly fee but then again there's you

00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,920
know there are certain providers that

00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,570
have a very low monthly fee like nine

00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,700
ninety five that includes everything so

00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,830
it's just kind of you know it's what is

00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,570
your what does your customer want right

00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,370
do they want it like an invoice in

00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,050
solution that comes free with with the

00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,880
product you know is that worth ninety

00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:37,440
five month is the reporting worth nine

00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,770
ninety-five a month you know being able

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,470
to see you know - you know what one

00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:45,300
thing that that that's always

00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:46,890
frustrating with PayPal is trying to

00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,110
find any kind of transactional data

00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:51,300
after six months right

00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,950
so a merchant provider is going to be

00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:56,130
able to give you that transactional data

00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:58,410
and hopefully 30 different filters to

00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:00,930
find that data right bye-bye a currency

00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:02,550
amount by transaction type by card type

00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:12,900
or so forth and allow you find that

00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:15,900
information a lot easier $9.95 so our

00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,390
company charges a 99.9 - five cent fee

00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,330
per month for the gateway in the

00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:27,020
merchant account and the PCI altogether

00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:27,020
what's that no no

00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,369
but you know like but lately every once

00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:33,660
in a while you you know we may not be

00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:35,700
connected to something and we may need

00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,980
to connect to authorized.net well

00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:41,670
there's a there's additional ten or

00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,900
fifteen dollars and usually if if if

00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,069
we're not connected well we'll give you

00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,390
a little bit more of a break on your

00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:54,950
discount rate just to kind of make up

00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:54,950
