Title: Sergio Scabuzzo: The Command Line is Your Friend: WP-CLI, the Shell and What They Can Do for You
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	April 6, 2019, 9 am Horseshoe Ranch Room, University Center, College of the Canyons — After this talk, you will have a clear understanding of what can be done with WP-CLI and the command line. I’ll share basic commands and more advanced scripts to ease your day to day interactions with WordPress. We’ll cover things like using ‘wp search-replace’ to find and replace instances of text in your database/posts, installing/activating multiple plugins in one command, and even backing up your site to your computer…

I'm surges Kabuto and this is going to

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:12,040
be WP CLI and the command line it's

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,040
gonna be a little bit

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,780
the usual talk because I'm gonna be on

00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,330
the command line

00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,869
about the whole time and I actually need

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:25,810
to set the talk up first because it is

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,390
ran through a WP CLI command that I

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,970
forked I'll talk about in a little bit

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,020
so let's see what do we do first this is

00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:37,720
a bash script that I set up that I will

00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:49,809
be talking about later actually

00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:54,940
oh one second this is the part that I

00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:56,949
did not set up earlier if you don't have

00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,019
a server up you're not gonna have a

00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,780
server to work with so this is talk is

00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:06,760
gonna be working off of a local vagrant

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,860
machine basically a virtual box that

00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:15,610
it's not running someone I started at

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:19,409
Brenda let's take a second and the intro

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,409
will come after it set up

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:32,640
so this script that I'm gonna be running

00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:34,860
right now basically it's going to I'm

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,600
sending what the hostess with a flag the

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,830
host is gonna be called new and I'm

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:45,900
gonna be installing WP CLI and core all

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,280
at once the WordPress and this is

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,800
detecting that it is already installed

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,120
uh BP CLI but I know on this server it's

00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,410
an older version so I'm going to

00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,800
actually override it

00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:59,790
so that's downloading it there and

00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:02,880
setting up WordPress this part is

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,080
through WP CLI I'll I'm starting kind of

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,200
fast but I'm going to go back to the

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,899
actual slow and kind of easy beginning

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,350
quick question actually who works on the

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,120
command line

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:17,960
commonly all right and who is this never

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,000
or barely ever uses the command line

00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,010
excellent and I know people that do use

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,750
the command line WP CLI it's something

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:30,000
that you use often enough okay so this

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,330
talking to be perfect cuz from beginning

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,340
to end the spectrum basically this

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,610
command here's what installs WordPress

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,600
and this is one of twelve commands that

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,310
you can input like actually for the

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,360
database database username password etc

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,730
so I set up this script to kind of have

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,489
preset a pre-configured parts but I'll

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,209
touch into that in a little bit I'm

00:02:53,489 --> 00:03:02,670
gonna just put the database name here

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:04,230
they use sir it's backwards and that

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,340
just popped up the config already this

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,010
could all be script there that's one

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,420
thing if you wanted to have like a site

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,370
all the time just to test on your

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,350
computer you could just have a script

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,850
that just does it automatically without

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,370
actually prompting you but I have this

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,700
set up because I often set up sites with

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,540
different you know names or database

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,540
credentials etc

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:36,890
there's gonna be my URL and I'm gonna

00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:40,060
call this site awesome so you can put

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:46,060
your username and password super secure

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:49,790
and my email I'll just call it that and

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,790
that should be it there and it pops up

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:56,659
our new site so that's already set and

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:59,260
configured this is the 2019 theme

00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:03,230
because we're all new in each school and

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:11,480
if we go to the admin I can't just log

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:15,910
in thanks for that sound goes perfect

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,440
that's the loads so there we are so now

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,750
we go back here and ice anyone familiar

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,560
with SSA Ching on to servers or not

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,720
familiar to say so ssh against our

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,800
server basically is a sense for secure

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,020
shell and it's a way to connect remotely

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
like from here to that server now the

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,699
service within my own computer at this

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,380
particular juncture but it connects to

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,419
the server and let's use that command

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,760
side command prompt so here you look at

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,570
my command prompt now and it looks one

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,889
way and if I say SSH new for all of this

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,030
that has to be pre-configured that you

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,409
have to have a configuration to your

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,599
server already that you can connect to

00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:57,010
like FTP you know how you get you think

00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:59,120
retentions for that same type of idea so

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,699
now I'm there and you see it's a

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:07,550
different command prompt right because

00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:12,080
now I am on the server and from here we

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:18,280
need to install the WP CLI percent

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,280
command which is this

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,480
a little ditty here that basically uses

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,480
OBP CLI to install a custom command not

00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,900
a built-in command from a github repo

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,880
that I have so that's pulling that in

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,860
and this is gonna actually start the

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,750
talk I'm just kind of setting it up so

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,750
you can see that how I set up WordPress

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:51,420
that is that OOP and now we move to

00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:01,170
where WordPress is and

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:13,830
start the talk then uh so this is

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,479
running this basically this percent

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,380
command what it does is the Parsis

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:21,449
markup which is kind of the file type

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,820
that you more often probably see on

00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,970
github when you see like their readme

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:33,419
files etc so this parses markup and

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:38,310
it'll show it as this question yes no I

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:41,000
can't because some of the slides take up

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,220
a good bit is that too small for your

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:53,130
kind of blurry can we all see that kind

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:55,620
of that's a good dude sorry so well to

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:59,250
start the talks or just Kabuto here if

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,169
I'm me on Twitter at eco techie and asks

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,330
the question says who is this guy right

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:06,330
just this is yapper over here

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:11,030
I run Linux exclusively I've been doing

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,030
it for over 10 20 years now actually and

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,080
I've been doing a lot of sustainability

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,669
work for over 15 years I do a lot of

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,330
water reclamation training and teaching

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:26,639
and the natural building permaculture

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,780
trainings etc happy to talk to anyone

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,050
about that it's not the subject today

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,970
but I'm very very passionate about that

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,979
as well

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,210
this next one it's actually kind of

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,270
jumped the gun on this I am actually

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,479
nuts a wordpress core contributor I have

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:47,280
a patch that it's gonna get supposedly

00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:50,130
committed by 5.2 it's gonna be awesome

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,130
and WP CLI I did contribute some some

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,880
code awhile back I founded eco techie I

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:59,550
oh that's a WordPress maintenance site

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,800
like server said I have which it's

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,870
mostly geared towards nonprofits and

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,009
kind of helping them out to kind of

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:11,310
bring up the the you know sustainability

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,710
systems and I brew things lots of things

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,320
also come later ask me about what I brew

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,660
and the fun things that we do and you

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,520
may have seen my VW bus out there

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,950
poor little things rusting up but it's

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,590
awesome I love it and it also turned me

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:29,280
into a mechanic because they break all

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:33,090
the time so for people that don't use

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,530
the command line too much they could -

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:39,810
awesome but it doesn't take any

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,160
prisoners it'll basically you mistyped

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,140
something you hit enter and you didn't

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,840
see what you did and you just broke

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,550
something something guide erase files

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,920
are gone so you always want to be

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,140
careful first thing I did with Windows

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,180
98 when I first found out about breaking

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,950
things I just had all these extra files

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,360
they know what they were doing delete it

00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,610
in them all next thing you know that was

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,300
all my windows files no more windows for

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,560
me similar but different problem but be

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,580
aware of what you're doing with before

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,430
you hit enter

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,470
definitely try not to copy and paste

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:13,080
things from the internet blindly at

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,730
least because things can break even from

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,650
this slide these slides here if you

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,960
check later and you want to kind of test

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,550
them out some things may not work with

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,300
your systems okay

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,170
so let's kind of get started with this

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,430
I'm gonna start with a command line

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,550
usage just kind of the shell and what we

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:36,900
do here

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:39,420
yeah good there will all be available

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:44,910
there's a link at the end to get them

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:47,750
and I yeah that's actually yeah so why

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,920
would you wanna use a command line this

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,620
mileage may vary but your friends will

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,790
think you're the coolest some of my

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,320
friends think I'm the coolest I don't if

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:59,190
it's because of that but let's just go

00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,740
with it it's been around for a long time

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,840
the command line was preceded any kind

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,850
of you know graphical interface these

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,090
all these commands have been around

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,880
since probably at least the 70's or most

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,280
of these commands at least so there are

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,360
just no bugs really to be dealt with on

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,640
these so they're pretty rock-solid and

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,930
you can put commands the cool thing

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,980
about this is you know yeah I'm going to

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,840
show you some comments in the beginning

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,140
pretty soon that you know show your

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,959
directory or let you delete a file or

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,399
do you know random things that doesn't

00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,260
seem so exciting because who cares you

00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,750
can just go to your window someone click

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,600
delete and be done with it the magic

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,610
about you know using the command line is

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,529
that you can actually script these

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,890
commands to do things all at once you

00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:49,360
automate things something in a way that

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,620
a lot of people do what you know

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,029
graphical interfaces you know like when

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,800
you have plugins doing things for you

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,600
with WordPress that's just the script

00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,240
that that's all all these individual

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,980
commands all at once so if you want to

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,570
spend the time and kind of learn to kind

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,160
of do a little bit of scripting it will

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,029
end up saving a lot of time on

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,560
repetitive tasks oh that's actually my

00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:10,060
next thing so yeah so repetitive tasks

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,950
that's the trick about also using

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,360
scripts is that you do want to make sure

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,149
that these are repetitive tasks that

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,190
you're doing on a script because

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,450
otherwise you're spending and now we're

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,769
writing a script for a thing that you're

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,740
gonna do once and it takes you five

00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:26,800
minutes so kind of you want to gauge

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,589
your things recents to not use a command

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,630
line this is probably more true than the

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:34,800
first one your friends will think you

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:38,709
are a dork at least most of mine do also

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,019
and it can also break things very easily

00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:43,540
as I said the commands are very

00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:46,779
rock-solid but our fingers maybe are not

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,760
I break things all the time even now you

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,829
saw me kind of having a Mis

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,240
configuration problem earlier things

00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,670
happen so you want to be careful what

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,589
you do usually want to test things on a

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,010
test server such as this one or other

00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:01,810
stuff like that and script writing like

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,310
I said that's a lot of things at once it

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,100
makes it even easier to break a lot of

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,199
things at once so things things to be

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:14,140
aware of and I mentioned this earlier

00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:15,160
exactly that when you uh you write you

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,990
know you spend a lot of time writing

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,760
I've done some scripts even once I'm

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,170
going to show you right now that I don't

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,060
really use that much it's kind of a

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,470
proof of concept but sometimes you'll

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,800
spend a lot of time with this awesome

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,449
concept of a script you write it and you

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,190
use it once and now you spend three

00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:33,160
hours again like on something that takes

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:36,569
two minutes to do the flip side of that

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,770
of course is that if you spend you know

00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:40,540
like day in and day out doing the same

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,089
process all the time you catch yourself

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,769
doing these things that

00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:45,809
when you it's a red flag to just go

00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,939
script it you script this and then you

00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:52,319
just write one command hit enter and it

00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:57,209
just gets done so it's a good bonus this

00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:59,309
is a very very low level of what the

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:03,600
command line can do so these these

00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:04,620
commands you have PWD there are people

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,170
that never used to cut my line here

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,069
right what service could a couple people

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,660
oh right

00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,860
so when you're on the command line I'll

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,329
show these examples in a little bit but

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,220
you have like PWDs I command that you

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:17,069
type and it shows you what director

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,660
you're in because not like on your you

00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:20,610
know whatever explore wonder you may

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,870
have on a graphical interface it shows

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,610
you the folders and everything and you

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,499
see where you're at the command line you

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,699
have a command line and where are you

00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:28,769
what's happening right so you just hit

00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:31,490
PWD and I'll show you what where you're

00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,839
at make directory creates a directory

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,629
you have a CD which changes that

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,180
directory you can see these LS search

00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:42,209
for list directory cat is a

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,399
concatenation it basically sends out

00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:46,800
like it prints out the contents of a

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,139
file on to the standard output or the

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,370
screen and this will make more sense

00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,420
when you start seeing what these things

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,889
do and man is kind of amazing

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,800
if you especially if you're learning I

00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:00,899
use it all the time it tells you it's

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,999
kind of like a help for all the comments

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,740
so I'll show you like all the specific

00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:08,429
options and what the commands do even

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:13,170
tells you history on the comments so I'm

00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:15,990
super handy now commence they have

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,329
what's called flags or options so here

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:21,689
we have the LS command okay now if you

00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:23,639
do like on Windows for Mac's you know

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,160
you have hidden files right that that

00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,470
you can't see your like system files

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,019
same thing with with Linux or any kind

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,730
of command line that if you do LS a it

00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,110
shows you those hidden files and I'll

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,509
show you this and once I can just after

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,860
this slide and you have LS L which is

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,300
kind of like a long listing more

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,059
information about these files it's kind

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,850
of like a more verbose information and

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:48,509
you can actually also put flags together

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,980
to kind of combine them and CD change

00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:52,350
directory also is a little trick there

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,970
if you put a hyphen next to the c CD it

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,279
kind of lets you jump back and forth

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,860
between the last and

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:02,790
with the current directory so I'm gonna

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:15,510
do a little quick demo of this I think

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:20,399
I'm I'm not that's because I don't have

00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:31,940
a new window one second we create a new

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:31,940
window so I don't loose this stuff here

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,019
actually so with my home directory so

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,790
here we have my directory right I have

00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,949
my my prompt touch you show me that what

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,529
the director I'm in some prompts don't

00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:51,180
so if you do PWD it tells you the

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:54,750
current folder right and then we have LS

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,670
shows me actually let me go to my home

00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,690
directory so if you hit CD and nothing

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,630
it actually takes you to your home

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:04,009
directory and then this is my home

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:06,300
directory what's in there if you do LS a

00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:08,399
shows you all of the hidden files as

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,120
well and then like I was saying earlier

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,699
if you LS L and then H actually sorry LS

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,089
l this shows you the right permissions

00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:21,420
on the left the user and the group that

00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:24,240
owns those files and that number in the

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,420
middle there like that a row these over

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,769
here they are what the size of these

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,160
files are which is essentially

00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:34,529
meaningless to most people so if you do

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,360
LS H which is that other option it

00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:38,160
actually shows you I don't know why

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,439
that's not standard but shows you the

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,089
actual sizes when you start messing

00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:43,560
around in the command prompt a lot you

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:49,410
do want to know what the file sizes are

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:51,500
etc so this kind of helps a good bit so

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,160
that those are flags and how to use them

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,310
this was something you want to be a

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,199
little bit careful with RM let's remove

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,889
it or remove files or directories and

00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:05,100
remove RM RF is unforgiving it will

00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:07,500
erase everything that you have there

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,089
basically there are some not-so-fun

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,030
scripts that will erase all of your

00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:14,220
computer with it this specific command

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:18,419
so we have the recursive flag that's the

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:21,120
are here and the AF which is for force

00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,880
now this here what this does is it'll

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,900
actually let you essentially exclude

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,870
files so this white box here is an

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,640
example of that command command line

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,039
touch is actually another command that

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,770
lets you create files and it'll let you

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,320
create a blank file and then the the

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,140
brackets there is a bracket expansion

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,270
basically so you touch files and it lets

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,150
you that lets you create a five files

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,639
named file one through five so you see

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:53,909
at the bottom you said I do touch

00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:56,039
file one through five LS and then when

00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:58,679
ALS I see this file one two three four

00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,269
and five I may be going a little fast

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,820
but I hope you follow me with it and

00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:06,929
then I do that command that I pointed up

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:10,080
up here and do an LS again and it kept

00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:11,549
those files there now this may not seem

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,289
like something you want to be doing when

00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,330
you're just working on your computer

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,519
right but this is super handy when

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,960
you're scripting because later you wanna

00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,440
maybe create some files and you race

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,419
them later but save these etc so this is

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,919
great you know cuz I mean I don't know

00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,470
does anyone here actually just

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,789
day-to-day just browse around and work

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,360
on their computer on the command line

00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:34,649
like really ah like you just use the

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:46,350
command line only do you not like on the

00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:48,020
GUI and expect it awesome kudos nice

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,069
that'll do it

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,069
[Music]

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,419
that is super awesome that's probably

00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:01,230
why you know so much about it part of it

00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:03,419
at least yeah so you know I mean it some

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:11,490
people actually do 100% work on the

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:13,320
command line no no for sure I mean yeah

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,580
it's not not often by choice right if we

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,389
have another option we'll go to the

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,620
graphical interface often but my point

00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:21,059
being that you know a lot of these

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,909
things may seem kind of like why would I

00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,559
want to do this when I have options but

00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:27,210
again is sometimes you don't have

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,940
options and also you have a graphical

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:33,149
interface but the scripting will help

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,570
you a lot with it with these things now

00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:40,049
aliases anyone most some who's familiar

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:42,330
here with aliases so everybody else in

00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:45,120
love you can start smart Bunch great

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,470
so aliases basically are commands that

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,940
can be a little convoluted or long to

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,350
write and you just get tired of writing

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:54,690
them so you can add them too I'm kind of

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,789
strictly a bash guy bashes the born

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,460
against shell it's basically on every

00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:02,070
server out there there are some that

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,559
don't have it rarely but so that's kind

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,350
of chose to

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,809
that one Mac users will use some other

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,950
one sometimes I think a zsh is a popular

00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:13,899
one as well

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:16,120
but so I'm saying that because aliases

00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:19,509
you can actually add them to the Bosh

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,889
bash RC file on your home directory this

00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,629
tilde here represents your home

00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:23,710
directory all the time so whenever you

00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:26,139
see that on a script or anything like

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,679
that that means the you the current

00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:32,379
user's home directory so here let's see

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,190
I'm gonna do a little quick demo again

00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:41,110
I'm gonna SSH onto the server again so I

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,529
am stuck with a command line and so I

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,259
haven't

00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:48,460
elías here for get pass right so what

00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:51,460
that does is it calls this program open

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:54,309
SSL creates a random basically for a

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,529
string of 20 characters okay so it kind

00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,960
of creates a password for you so it's

00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,610
get passed right if I type get passed

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,399
now there's nothing here it doesn't

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,259
exist but if I create you can also

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:07,470
create aliases temporarily which is

00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:12,340
exactly what I'm going to do right now

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:16,480
you do that and now if I do get pass and

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:19,360
there's my random password right again

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,580
great for scripting one thing to know

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,559
you may have noticed if you press up and

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,899
down on most shells it'll kind of give

00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,190
you the previous or next command that

00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:28,509
you wrote I could just kind of go up and

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,330
down and it shows you like what I've

00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:34,110
been writing so it's good to kind of not

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:37,179
have to retype things a lot of times

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:40,269
another popular one at least that I use

00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:41,710
aliases is a there's a pseudo and a few

00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,789
familiar with that so you do it's

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:47,169
basically when you're trying to do on a

00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:51,669
command line an administrator permission

00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:54,490
like command and you'll just get no

00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:56,350
permission to do it I mean why don't you

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,860
show you a guess but it's something such

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:02,789
as apt-get Afghanistan install software

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,429
at least on Ubuntu based software or

00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:07,720
Linux is and if you do this then now you

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:09,730
don't have to type it anymore you just

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:15,830
do apt-get and it'll actually just do su

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:19,040
do before sudo stands for Super User do

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,210
kind of an easy one so it's good for

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,900
easy wins

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:26,780
oh speaking of you see once so now let's

00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,309
talk about WP CLI and will later kind of

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:33,679
put them all together into actual bash

00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:36,440
or shell scripting and WP CLA the idea

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,190
behind WP CLI is to be able to do

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,220
anything you can do on the admin page

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:46,730
the WordPress admin page with the

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,410
command line so I believe they're pretty

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,770
much there but there may be some things

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,750
that you can't do on the command line

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,059
and again with that what's the point if

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,480
you can just do it on the under you know

00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:00,980
on the screen and the browser but the

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,660
idea again is script ability you can

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,670
just actually just write one single

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,120
script and do a bunch of things all at

00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,280
once

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,520
or also even things that I'll be showing

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,020
in a second these are commands that I

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,900
use a lot they're pretty popular or

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:18,170
pretty pretty common one is to backup

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:23,840
your database super easy to do you just

00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:27,890
do WP as a command for WP CLI so you do

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:31,490
WP DB export I'm gonna change the

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:36,200
directory to the server where the server

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:38,390
is so here you'll see all the CI do an

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,920
LS and you see all the the WordPress

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:45,290
files right if I put in that command

00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,760
here now you see this is a small size

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,890
short a small site but it immediately

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,420
created a backup of the database and yes

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:57,320
we can do this with plugins but this is

00:23:53,420 --> 00:24:01,070
best another thing I think it's pretty

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,630
awesome as WP media regenerate what this

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,960
does is sometimes you have to recreate

00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:08,690
it all your images because you changed a

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,370
theme or just the way your your sizes of

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,900
your images are right and then you know

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,120
your site stops working it doesn't look

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,590
right you have to use plugins such as

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,300
what is the media to regenerate

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,940
regenerate thumbnails I think it's

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,400
called you can do that or you can just

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,440
put that you know type that up or have

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,169
it in a script run it and then I'll just

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,000
read it generate all of the missing only

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:34,700
with this flag

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,350
image sizes and this one is the personal

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,580
favourite of mine I just kind of found

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:41,450
it out the other day and it's super

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:43,070
awesome as WP checksum checksum is

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:47,539
anyone not know what a checksum is or

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:50,600
checksum is basically like a a long

00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:52,039
number that I'm actually I can explain

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,700
this very well but with the a checksum

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:58,730
is a number that represents the exact

00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,470
contents of a file so if that file gets

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,880
changed that number would change also

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,279
it's a way to kind of make sure that

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,840
nothing has been changed on a file you

00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,980
do that a lot with security and or when

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,289
you do downloads you're supposed to

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,710
check some what this does is it actually

00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:15,500
checks does that a checksum of the the

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,840
WordPress stock installation and also

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:21,049
the plugins that are on the repository

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,690
for WordPress it'll do that also so you

00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:26,210
can run this command of course I just

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,399
installed this WordPress installation so

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,320
there should not be any problems but it

00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:33,139
basically checks all of the files so if

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,330
anything has been changed without you

00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:38,269
knowing it kind of like a hack check of

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,710
sorts I wouldn't just rely on this but

00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:41,269
it's kind of nice to know like oh this

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:46,519
is an extra file here now or something

00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:48,830
changed and actually you know what I'm

00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:52,309
gonna do a quick thing just to note if

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:54,649
you just had WP it will show you all of

00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:56,690
your available commands and as you can

00:25:54,649 --> 00:26:03,440
tell here in some explanation there's a

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:06,590
lot of them the WP CLI dot or WP - CLI

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,769
dot org website has all of this and much

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:12,590
more in death and you can also just kind

00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:16,279
of hit help do do a come in and just put

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:19,059
- yeah - I can help and it'll give you a

00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,059
lot more information

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,710
so here's some kind of common issues

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,440
show of hands anyone ever seen a white

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,350
screen of death you know what those are

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,759
fun right or or you know get up install

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,859
a plugin and it just breaks their sites

00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,749
or some functionality changes and you

00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,190
don't you don't wanna have to go fix it

00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:44,340
all and see what's happening especially

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,929
in a life site right or what I do a lot

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,340
of times if I new up I can new update

00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:49,379
comes for a plugin that I'm not really

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,950
sure about I'll let it sit for two three

00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:54,330
days just to make sure that you know it

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,269
things are sorted and it's actually

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,769
working well and even sometimes I may

00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:00,899
forget to update for a month

00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:03,509
and enough they just came out so maybe I

00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:05,009
want to do the previous update right so

00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:07,590
with this command here you can actually

00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:08,789
select the version that you install what

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,859
that does is it kind of mitigates

00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:12,929
hopefully most of these throw those

00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:15,090
three problems because you can rob they

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:16,859
essentially roll back that that

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,159
installation you just did to a previous

00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:22,230
version of the plugin slug here I you

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,119
slug a lot here we all know what a slug

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:28,710
is right that's just kind of so sluggish

00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:32,239
like the like a short name for your

00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,440
plugin or like when you go to like

00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:36,480
WordPress if you search for that plug-in

00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,139
that slug is like this short name it's

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,359
on the address bar of the browser same

00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:44,369
with your theme and then like all your

00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,629
posts like the post slug is what's on

00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:51,389
the address bar of your post name

00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:54,239
essentially often or sometimes hopefully

00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:56,159
if if this doesn't fix something that

00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:58,320
you would like it to be you can do WP

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,960
plugin deactivate and then the plug-in

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,190
name from the command line what this

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,779
does is it lets you save a lot of time

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,700
something often your may not be on your

00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,289
computer on your screen and you kind of

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,450
need to get things done or someone calls

00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:11,700
you and tells you hey my plug-in broke

00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,049
on exercise that I'm maintaining so you

00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,279
just kind of are there already you just

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:16,259
hit the command and you're done

00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:19,649
I suppose having to load up things and

00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:23,970
wait for logins and also you can

00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:26,159
deactivate and uninstall plugins just by

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:32,460
doing that actually let's let's do that

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:34,880
one here so no nothing against the Hello

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:38,630
Dolly plug-in but

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:47,630
I'm gonna do it is it actually sorry

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:51,710
uninstall hello here and so this able

00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,710
deactivate no question of these things

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:57,600
deactivates so there I just deactivated

00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,159
and uninstalled Hello Dolly which is

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,490
that I think that I like this about this

00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,690
is that when we understand plugins often

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,309
you have to do as we all know we have to

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,450
deactivate it wait for it to deactivate

00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:13,259
and then uninstall with this is one

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,730
command and you're done if you have any

00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:16,830
questions don't don't hesitate

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:20,899
I kind of get a guy give a bit of buffer

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,899
of time so feel free

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,419
yes there is you do

00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:32,009
WP I think I use it in a little bit but

00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,750
it's a plug-in list and then it shows it

00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:35,490
to you I just installed this and I did

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,980
install the other plugin but it's a

00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,750
shows a kismet and it tells you the they

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,460
enacted if it's active or inactive if

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:48,450
there's an update on the current version

00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:50,789
of it you can you can do a list see what

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,950
you have yeah well we'll get into that

00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:58,190
that's a little ahead but yeah exactly

00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:00,269
exactly that updating a password so you

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,490
know anyone ever forgot their password

00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:04,590
or forgot a pass before a WordPress site

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,600
so that's not fun right you have to

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,889
follow all these steps you go you can

00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,860
let you click on the forgot password

00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:12,600
link you enter your email or username

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,779
you wait for that email you open up your

00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,549
email tab or program wait for that to

00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:19,590
come through then you click on the reset

00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,929
button take you to the site again you

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:25,259
have to reset the password and then you

00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:27,419
got to go and log back in right or you

00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:30,210
can just with this yes SSH into the

00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:32,070
server go to the WordPress directory use

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,909
this command and it is updated you're

00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:38,580
done I could do that right now actually

00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:41,580
what was my I'm not gonna use this

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,309
password though but my password I set it

00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,820
up as one two three right so I'm gonna

00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:50,840
do this and I'm going to say password

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:52,940
three-two-one okay or forget otherwise

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,530
and we'll see this come up later I'm

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,660
gonna have to log in later so you'll see

00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,160
that I just it's already changed like

00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,870
that it updated the database and we're

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,360
all set

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,160
you can also suppose to you know you can

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,590
like create your own password with that

00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,170
get past command that we did earlier

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,510
right that's the alias and not have

00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:15,290
something like this a cool password I

00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:17,330
created there another thing yesterday we

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,930
had a talk about Korea working with

00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:23,090
child themes was anyone from here there

00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:25,310
so this this command here will do that

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,990
in a flash you're done you just hit this

00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,870
and you just created a child theme from

00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,460
your currently active non child theme

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,910
you can't create a child theme from a

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,470
child theme so what is happening here

00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,760
that if you're noticing it's a little

00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,070
bit more convoluted than the commands

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,920
I've been showing you this is using

00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,750
command substitution what happens with

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,860
that is that anything within the dollar

00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:51,410
sign and parenthesis is a sub command

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,480
that opens up a new shell essentially

00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,640
and runs that command and then the

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,280
response of that command gets put into

00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:02,990
that space okay so I'm gonna show you

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:07,580
what that means right now this is this

00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:10,250
WP theme list active themes and it's

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:14,180
gonna only show me the field name so

00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:16,430
what we saw here right here we have the

00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,950
field name fuel status field update and

00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:22,700
field version of that listing that I did

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:24,470
earlier right here I'm gonna do the same

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,640
but it's only going to show me the 2019

00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:31,520
theme if I did without field name only

00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:35,870
it would show me all the information so

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:41,330
going back to this this here is going to

00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:44,030
be reprobate when T 19 right so this is

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,910
command substitution so what I'm gonna

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,450
do now is I'm gonna run it again I run

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,450
this command

00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,520
and we'll see that now has switched it

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,150
to hope I forgot to change my theme name

00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:01,790
so it's now called slug but that's okay

00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:04,730
so now if I do that again I see that my

00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,310
current active Themis slug with that

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:10,520
command alone I just immediately created

00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:15,130
a child theme and I don't have some one

00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,130
time that less than half a second

00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:22,540
and that's yeah that's one of the magic

00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:25,720
tricks of that weepy CLI and how they

00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:29,330
develop it or like part of their there

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:33,200
yeah they'll that is that they want

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:35,300
commands to be single-use but composable

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,680
so you have a command that well nothing

00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,540
will use but I command that it has like

00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,010
one purpose and does it does it well so

00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,200
there's like the plug-in command that

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:44,750
installs a plugin and that's it and you

00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,430
think or like the the listing ones like

00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,470
who cares about listing plugins that

00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,880
doesn't seem so handy but when you

00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,100
couple it with other things you're like

00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,860
I'm gonna get a list of active plugins

00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,870
and then update only the active one it's

00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,400
not the inactive one so I'm gonna do a

00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,290
lot of things you kind of like start

00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,400
putting these commands together and that

00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:06,260
becomes super super super handy this

00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,160
happened to me the other day I had a I

00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:11,510
have a client that wanted me to help

00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,760
clean up their site and I went and

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,600
locked in and saw that they had

00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,120
literally a hundred and thirty two

00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,860
installed themes I don't know how many

00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,960
of you ever seen anything like that that

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:24,130
kind of freaked me out a little bit most

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,990
I've ever seen was like seven ten maybe

00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:29,630
and you know when you have to understand

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:32,060
a seam and at least the dashboard you

00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,310
got to go to the dashboard you selected

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,750
you hit the delete button you wait then

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,610
it does it and you got to go and do it

00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,010
again right after three or four it gets

00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:42,800
kind of old and that's again the reason

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,090
why we do scripting you script this and

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,510
it's done you don't have to even think

00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,510
about it

00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,270
excellent question

00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:52,130
no because if you look at the the code

00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,510
here right it says WP theme delete and

00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,060
then I'm doing a command substitution

00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,160
right you see the parentheses there and

00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,280
then what I'm doing is WP theme list

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,660
status inactive and then field lame name

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,510
not lame so what this does is

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:10,150
that lists all the inactive themes you

00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:15,430
so it excludes the active ones and then

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:17,890
we know Bo you're not using a child

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,660
theme so it gets out like oh I'm sorry

00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:21,670
Bo no no so okay so what happens with

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:25,299
this is inactive there's three things

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:27,609
here there's inactive I think its parent

00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:28,539
and active or something like that

00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:30,099
there's there's like a distinction

00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:30,579
between parent and child themes also in

00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,400
the list

00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:35,650
I checked trust me whatever you're

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,270
raising they're all of their themes but

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,460
yeah there's a distinction that the the

00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:42,369
inactive is specific to it not being

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,470
active or being needed at all because

00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:48,490
the active the parent theme is also kind

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:53,740
of has its own field name actually where

00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:57,329
we can see what it is here it oh wait

00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,329
not active I want to see all the themes

00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:03,520
it is parent yeah I was so this active

00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:09,279
parent and inactive yeah you know how I

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:14,740
found that one out yeah so again be

00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:17,890
careful with scripting so this one this

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:21,690
is possibly the only thing that WP CLI

00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:24,069
can do that the the dashboard cannot

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,730
there are plugins for this but this this

00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:30,279
searches and replaces your database

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,569
super awesome super dangerous be very

00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:34,180
careful when you start messing with the

00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:35,559
database that's what we do the previous

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:40,059
command that I show you the backup

00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:41,700
database kind of awesome right so what

00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:43,450
you do is you do WP search and replace

00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,549
something old whatever you want to

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,579
replace with something new whatever it

00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:51,700
is and then I have the report changed

00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:54,279
only command there just to keep it

00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,599
simple sometimes when you when you ask

00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:58,990
it to do things it'll show you a list of

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,940
the whole database tables and it'll say

00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,160
zero changes zero changes zero changes

00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,109
zero changes one change and like fifty

00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,150
zero changes so this shows you only the

00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:08,859
things that it actually changed and dry

00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,869
run it's something something that you

00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:13,150
want to do because again you're messing

00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:14,890
with a database so dry dry run shows you

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,059
what it's going to be doing before it

00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,059
does it yeah

00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,490
I'm not even gonna get into that but

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,140
yeah if you look at the this this

00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,120
command it has a ton of options yeah

00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,640
especially there's specific tables you

00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,290
can say what you to exclude and tables

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,540
let's start with what you can do every

00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:35,500
table in the database nice things that

00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:40,790
are not even an inward price I believe

00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:42,830
you do a lot with it I believe so we'd

00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:47,780
have to look at the the help on it I can

00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:49,130
do that in a little bit if you want yes

00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,770
my understanding is that it does yeah it

00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:55,100
does deal with data serialization which

00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,400
is awesome because otherwise what's the

00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,260
point

00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:06,020
so wish me luck here I'm gonna do a demo

00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:08,240
of WP search and replace so we're gonna

00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:11,930
go to these sites that we had earlier

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,730
right and we're going to what are we

00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:18,770
gonna do let's see we're gonna create a

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:26,540
link on the hello world post so when you

00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:31,160
go to posts edit and yes Goodin burg is

00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:35,420
great and I'm gonna do ctrl K so the

00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,760
shortcut to add a link and I'm actually

00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:41,620
gonna link it to itself the super meta

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:46,850
here an update

00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:50,900
let's view this post and what we have

00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:53,780
here is a link to itself right now you

00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:58,310
see this new dot local host this is the

00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:00,170
stock permalinks that WordPress has so

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:03,410
it's the year the month and the day and

00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,720
then your post more often than not

00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:10,370
people don't want that I've come to find

00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:13,660
out they often just want the post after

00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:13,660
the name okay

00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:27,880
a minute okay okay thanks so what we're

00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:30,640
gonna do is do a bonus round here and do

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,980
WP rewrite structure will which will

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:40,690
change the permalinks now what you're

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:42,100
seeing here is actually my my my script

00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,390
here kind of messed this up a little bit

00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,850
so I'm gonna have to type it is I

00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:48,790
supposed to be a percentage sign post

00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:53,410
name but that's how I changed things so

00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:54,640
I'm gonna just type it in cuz hey there

00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:59,110
we go so what this does is going to

00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,950
change the permalinks to be just the

00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:06,360
post name and get the dates out of there

00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:08,920
so let's go over here and refresh and

00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,560
what happens that's not working anymore

00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,330
because it has the date on it so let's

00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,640
go back to this awesome installation and

00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:17,470
now we see that HelloWorld is there and

00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:22,110
that's great and now our address is

00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:26,170
HelloWorld right but what happened here

00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:27,580
the date is still there on the links and

00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,850
now we want to do what are we going to

00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,820
do

00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:34,120
just change it what do you do edit the

00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:39,430
post right super easy and no no big no

00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:41,620
biggie there so link is gone and you

00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:44,950
just update it but what happens with

00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:48,400
another command I'm going to share here

00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:51,040
is WP create post and I'm gonna actually

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:57,030
just essentially copy the post with ID

00:40:51,040 --> 00:41:03,260
number one so I just now created two

00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:06,080
HelloWorld posts right

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,060
and no big deal with that what do you do

00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,200
just add a to post who cares but let's

00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,940
say you've been running your site for a

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,840
long time and you have a lot of links to

00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:17,540
change this one here I'm gonna run this

00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:21,440
is a bit of a bash ism of sorts but I'm

00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:23,810
doing that for loop with the bracket

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,690
expansion so I'm running 10 times and

00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:28,609
then this two exclamation marks

00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,619
basically means the previous command

00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:33,740
so the previous command was WP post

00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:35,840
create right so what this is going to do

00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:39,020
is it's going to create me 10 copies of

00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:43,430
that command so now what do we have

00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:47,420
we're gonna have believe 12 posts to

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:49,940
edit and that gets to be a little bit

00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:57,910
less fun to go and edit each single one

00:41:49,940 --> 00:42:01,760
right so we do this crazy command here

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:04,640
which is it's basically a regular

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,100
regular expression reg X if anyone uses

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,500
it I try to learn it it's awfully hard

00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:13,340
to learn anyway some people here may be

00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:16,730
great at it and I'm so jealous so what

00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,310
this is doing here I'll just kind of

00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,130
good real quick by it but zero through

00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:26,390
nine is basically it's looking for

00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:28,790
anything with a dash that has four

00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:32,869
characters that are anywhere from 0 to 9

00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:34,910
and again repeated another dash with two

00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:36,310
characters 0 through 9 and another dash

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,140
same thing

00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:42,020
another dash and then the post write

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,200
anything that has a through Z 0 through

00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:48,410
9 a hyphen or an underscore and then

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,740
these parentheses basically makes it a

00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:54,410
group in this reg X is this beyond the

00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,270
scope of this talk but and then that

00:42:54,410 --> 00:43:00,950
gets put into a1 so basically this is

00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:03,560
the old thing and that that first group

00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,570
is essentially represented by the dash 1

00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:09,320
here so I'm replacing all of that

00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:13,369
anything that has all of that links with

00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:16,430
the one with the post name and here's

00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:18,850
where I'm gonna just cross my fingers

00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:21,200
and we're all gonna hope that this works

00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:27,170
so we're just gonna run it actually

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:29,360
let's do a dry run just dry run right in

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:33,620
there so this runs and it tells me it's

00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:38,150
gonna replace 13 instances and at WP

00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:40,550
post content actually yeah here it won't

00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:45,140
be anyways so now I'm actually gonna run

00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:47,830
it and hopefully it says to changed all

00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:53,030
of them and now we're gonna see that it

00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:55,640
changed them and if it did I win yes the

00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,350
Internet wins there it is so now all

00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,050
every single one of those links is

00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:02,210
changed this can be I'm sure we can all

00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:03,860
think of reasons to use this exact

00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,840
scenario for many things right if you

00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,550
have I mean things that you've written a

00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:14,480
lot you might change all of them and all

00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:16,730
of your previous posts now aliases there

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,000
are also aliases in how much time do I

00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,300
have

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,590
oh my good lord

00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,660
okay there are aliases with WP CLI that

00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:31,010
make it very very handy because you get

00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:33,350
to use you get to call the cert the

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:35,900
servers from your local computer so

00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:38,030
basically what happens is you add

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,890
something like this you have at

00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:42,050
production and that's your alias for the

00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:44,240
server and then this is your SSH

00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,220
information for the server that you

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,410
would be connecting to you can also do

00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,630
aliases that are groups of aliases and

00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:53,090
you would put that in this file here on

00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,860
your server I mean on your local

00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:59,540
computer I'm gonna go a little fast here

00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:01,760
what's that list you do is do commence

00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,950
from your local computer I suppose so SS

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,050
aging into the server so on your own

00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,390
computer you can start using WP CLI and

00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:12,320
tell it to run it on those servers over

00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:14,510
there I ran out of time there's a lot

00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,070
here that it's actually pretty good but

00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,960
okay so one quick that I'm going to go

00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:20,450
into this here it's something that lets

00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,570
you for developers that lets you export

00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:25,310
your database on to this unto a your

00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:27,350
production server and then from your

00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:29,150
development server import it directly

00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,319
onto your production server and then do

00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:33,469
a search and replace

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,509
of the address on there so you kind of

00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:38,299
do a quick swab that makes it super easy

00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:42,609
to do stuff like that these sites this

00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:46,249
will be online and I am out of time

00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:51,259
right okay so thank you there will be

00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:54,759
all night and this is the address to

00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:54,759
