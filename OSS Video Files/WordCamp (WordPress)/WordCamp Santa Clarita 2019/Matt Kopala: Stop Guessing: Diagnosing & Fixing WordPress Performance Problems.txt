Title: Matt Kopala: Stop Guessing: Diagnosing & Fixing WordPress Performance Problems
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	April 5, 2019, 2:30 pm WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019, Vasquez Rocks Room, University Center, College of the Canyons — Speed matters. People are impatient. If your website or a client’s website doesn’t load quickly – within a just a couple of seconds – many visitors will abandon it completely. A slow site means lost time & revenue. But figuring out how to speed up a slow site can be HARD. Everyone’s got a suggestion and an idea for how to fix your performance issues, but most are just guesses, and not based on real data. STOP GUESSING. If you have a performance issue, or just want a faster site, you need to KNOW exactly what is slowing things down, and how to fix it. Matt Kopala’s talk will show you how.

thanks everyone for coming I'm going to

00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,610
talk about performance I'm gonna talk

00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,900
about quite a bit today I'm going to go

00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:17,700
pretty fast I tried to cut some

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,789
hopefully it's not too technical

00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,529
I will see how much I cover I'm gonna

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:28,410
try and do a live demo because I'm crazy

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,550
and and I don't know if there's if I

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,050
don't have time for questions at the end

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,590
just kind of find me after work so

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,030
alright let's get started so first a

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,309
little bit about me and I think actually

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,420
most of this was covered so I'm from

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,210
Arizona I live in Northern California

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,340
now though I went to school University

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,309
of Arizona study computer engineering

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,929
worked at AMD in Austin Texas for a

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,030
couple years after that and worked on

00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:53,039
the design team for the first 64-bit

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,300
processor and that little perm third was

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,760
mine but I went backpacking for three

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,589
and a half years real-world after that

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,519
which was you want to talk about travel

00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:07,500
come find me later to WordPress so back

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,060
in I think it was 2011 just after my

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,450
daughter was born I got into WordPress

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,280
and doing some freelance consulting

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,540
development work at the time did some

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,790
plug-in development and worked on a

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,700
back-end service for a client and that

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,740
client ended up being successful ended

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,650
up with hundreds of his own clients and

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,110
sites but he was having performance and

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,610
security issues with the sites so when I

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,220
took a look I was like oh I can solve

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,890
that and so and that's how a site

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,120
district was born and so we've been

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,010
doing WordPress hosting and we now have

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,160
hundreds of clients and thousands of

00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,370
sites on our platform alright so here's

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,650
what I'm going to talk about today first

00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,100
why performance matters like why are we

00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:55,980
even here so I'll cover that measuring

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:58,320
website performance so WordPress hosting

00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,790
and the affect on it we'll talk about

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,280
diagnosing the server response time so

00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,230
we'll talk a bit about the full load of

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,959
your page into the browser when people

00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:13,500
are looking at it and then a little bit

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,319
about caching and like I said demo if

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,970
there's times all right let's hold the

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,690
questions until the end unless they're

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,690
critical

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:28,620
we get it ran out of your yes so on the

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,810
first slide I had a link to it and I

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,480
think kind of towards Andhra I have

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:38,189
another link to it also tweeted out

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,659
afterwards and yeah alright first why

00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,299
does performance matter

00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,640
well I there's a website that I like

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:48,060
that I think really kind of communicates

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,980
the question well and so I'm not

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,139
affiliated with them and I just thought

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,670
this is a really good marketing page for

00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:58,139
white and WordPress performance matters

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,510
so why does speed matter some other

00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:03,389
reason so made-up conversions and page

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,579
abandonment I think if you've got a

00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,530
business that's you're making money off

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:09,359
of it you want you want those pages to

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,430
load fast if you're working and

00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:13,379
developing on WordPress then a good

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,620
waste your time if the WordPress admin

00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,480
is and the backend is slow visit our

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,040
customer perception so if you've got

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,409
someone coming your site and it takes a

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,310
long time to low they're not going to

00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:29,099
think is highly of you and your website

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,989
your Google ranking and so speed at

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,329
Google is said at least for in some case

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:36,599
the speed is definitely a factor in

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:39,239
their ranking and client satisfaction

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,430
you build a nice fast website for

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,690
someone new they're more likely to be

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,470
happy with it come back for more

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,810
recommend you to someone else so and I'd

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,530
like to claim you've been more boldly

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:56,280
that speed equals happiness so how many

00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:04,409
so to drive that point home how many

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:06,689
people have you heard say that alright

00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,909
so a quick survey for love beginners day

00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,079
version here how many of you are just

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,159
starting with a wordpress and haven't

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:18,840
haven't even used it yet okay I've got

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,820
about five six hands have a new um site

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,479
that you three months or so that you're

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,580
just starting on all right few more how

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,460
many of you recently bought a hosting

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,760
package for one two three years right

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,320
about ten people how many of you worked

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,620
on or developed on a site that was slow

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,979
or

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,020
became slow oh look around there got the

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,550
most hands on that one I should have

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,430
asked the other questions I have in here

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,990
too how many of no frickin clue what a

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,410
4x WordPress performance of how to

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:53,520
improve it all right hopefully yeah I

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,590
think you're in the right place so I

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,389
just made this slide this morning let's

00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,979
talk a little bit about habituation and

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,780
and the idea of that I'm not a

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,690
psychologist so if someone's in here and

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,910
I've God totally wrong sorry if you're

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,580
just getting started on your site then

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:12,360
whatever speed you're developing on will

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,919
probably seem normal to you but you'll

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,660
probably actually not understand the

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,220
magnitude of the difference in WordPress

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,690
speed until you actually experience it

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,870
variations in speed for the same site

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,840
can actually be huge and sites can be

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,520
ten times faster on some hosts or with

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,770
unnecessary plugins compared to an

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:38,580
optimized version and I'll do a quick

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,490
demos of that here I've got a site

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,320
that's hosted at one place you could

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,840
probably figure out if you want and then

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,099
a copy that's running on our hosting and

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,610
I want to show you the difference

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,610
between the two

00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,500
so let's I'm going to load this up and

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:04,229
it is going through my phone so might be

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,729
some we'll see how how long it what it's

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:09,030
like but you notice I'm clicking around

00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:15,440
kind of waiting for it how long does it

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:19,740
take to get from one page to another so

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:24,750
that's that's a one version mmm maybe

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:32,940
try one more page all right now let's go

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:39,389
to the exact same site but hosted on our

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:44,310
routes if I spell it right okay same

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:49,740
site notice the difference exact same

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:52,770
site and this is not caching at work

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:57,990
this is this is PHP generating the

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,310
WordPress pages as we go and it's

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,440
running through my phone because I

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:05,520
tethered because the Wi-Fi you know

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,409
Wi-Fi these places okay so that's the

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,690
demo so hopefully you can see actually

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:12,240
see a little bit there of the actual

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,099
difference in speed and that's it

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,229
so I was trying to get to the idea of

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,550
experiencing it a little bit you saw how

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:21,090
long it took to click through some of

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,099
those pages all right so why don't more

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,650
developers designers and site owners fix

00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,750
slow sites and my hypothesis is that

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,569
slow is comfortable and optimization is

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:34,110
risky and uncertain you or they don't

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:36,360
know how to make a site faster and you

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,270
don't know if or how much faster your

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,340
site could be and it's not that you

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,050
don't want sites to be faster it's just

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,050
not a priority so I want to talk a

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,300
little bit about that last part priority

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,699
so I'd like to say that priority equals

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,659
value over effort we've already talked

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:57,240
about the value of fast sites and

00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:01,409
performance and now if your effort goes

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,089
down then your priority will go up so my

00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:05,860
goal today is to show you how to

00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:08,410
minimize that effort

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,460
all right next how do we measure

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,620
performance and what is good performance

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,170
so let's talk about some basics this

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,690
here is a simplified version of what's

00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,340
called a waterfall for a website loading

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,280
when you type in an address in your

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,660
browser and you try to get it to load

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,890
your browser will send up a request to

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,830
figure out hey where's that site live

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,930
that's the DNS lookup after that he'll

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,960
negotiate a secure connection with the

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,880
server with HTTPS that is if your site

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,000
is running HTTPS and these days all

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,680
sites should be and then it will say to

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
send that request to the server and then

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,650
you will wait for some amount of time

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,470
for that request to come back from the

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,110
server and that that's the server

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,240
response and that's and then once your

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,230
browser has that initial page back then

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,700
it can start doing a bunch of stuff

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,050
somewhat in parallel it can start

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,450
reading through that page ensign oh hey

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,280
what else do I need to load thinking so

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,230
it'll start reading HTML and I'll decide

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,580
hey what else doing don't what image is

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,500
doing able at Java scripts and

00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,440
stylesheets and things like that and

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,810
then it'll actually do the hard work of

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:16,150
rendering and painting the web page so

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:18,610
that you can actually see it - so this

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,260
first part here and sometimes just even

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,140
this server response time here is often

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,570
called the time to first byte and that

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,100
right there is WordPress and that's the

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:32,020
bottleneck I'd like to say too that

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:35,320
WordPress by itself is pretty fast it's

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:39,070
it's it can run quite quite quickly on

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,390
most in most places but then often to

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,860
make a site you SFIL you need to start

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,120
that you put a theme on it you start

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,860
adding plugins you add additional

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,660
functionality stuff like that

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,950
and then before you know it your

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,750
WordPress site could slow down

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,720
significantly so that's that's why we're

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,490
talking about this today all right so

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
what about this time to first byte how

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,110
fast should it be well obviously the

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,540
faster the better and we're interested

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,400
in that I haven't talked about caching

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,550
yet but when we're talking about

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,410
performance in a lot of cases we want we

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,150
want that time to first byte to be as

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,620
quickly as possible without caching

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,510
because caching is not always going to

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,740
take effect if you don't know what

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,370
caching is we'll talk about that more

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,350
later so I consider

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,839
fast very fast for time to first byte is

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:27,160
50 to 150 milliseconds maybe in luck

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,690
even less fast 150 to 300 and going on

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,950
up a ver äj--

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:35,710
slow and very slow in some sites I've

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:38,230
seen it's 15 to 30 seconds so someone is

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,570
staring at a blank white page in their

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:44,470
browser for 15 to 30 seconds before they

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,930
see anything on some sites so what's a

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,540
good target I think for WordPress

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,760
generally under 500 milliseconds for

00:10:49,540 --> 00:11:00,180
uncashed time to first byte is a good

00:10:51,760 --> 00:11:03,580
target no so this is just the time that

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,160
it takes for your browser to ask the

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,750
server to send back the first part of

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,839
the HTML to the page that's before

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,279
ending rendering starts and so that's

00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,720
why I talked about earlier as being the

00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:18,880
bottleneck so all right so how do we

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,950
test this time to first byte there are

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,660
some good tools out here there's this

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,900
Chrome extension that I really like and

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,160
it's called page performance and it's

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,959
kind of picture of the guy in here it's

00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,720
kind of weird but I mean you install

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,520
that in chrome and for every page that

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,290
you load if you want it's gonna throw

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,180
the number up a number up here and then

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,620
you can click on that that icon and

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,060
it'll tell you what your time to first

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,560
byte is for any page that you've loaded

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,140
so I just have this sitting there if I'm

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,430
ever curious after loading a page I can

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,029
just click on the extension and it will

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:52,450
tell me umm these are from Seattle I

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,430
didn't get a chance to update them all

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,410
right and another way is you can

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,760
actually use Chrome to get the numbers

00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,470
so you can click up here on the little

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,959
dots come down to more tools open your

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,700
developer tools you can then click on

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:07,150
the network tab and then you can reload

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,339
the page and you can then get the time

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,890
to first byte from the from there it'll

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,930
show it over here this though you do

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,490
have to open up the network tab and then

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,870
actually reload the page whereas the

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,620
Chrome extension will show you for

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,870
anything that you've loaded all right

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,570
one of my favorite tools is webpagetest

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,430
and that you can find at webpagetest.org

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,760
if you go there you'll see a form that

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,750
looks like this now there are some

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,640
important

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,560
settings to figure out when you're doing

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,950
this these are the ones I think make

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,870
sense first pic you'll pick a location I

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,430
often recommend picking one close to

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,050
where your visitors are or actually

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,820
close to where your server is if you

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,270
want to test your server performance at

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,890
its best and if you also want to test

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,300
your server performance at his best pick

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,870
a native connection I believe is

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,430
defaults to cable do one test run but

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,070
then make sure you click first and

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,770
repeat view and then also this important

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,320
one here is capture video and after we

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,360
do that well that's just the summary of

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,130
what I said

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,690
then you run click that button and you

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,980
might wait a few minutes so you might be

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,720
put in a queue it's a free tool and

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,130
sometimes you have to wait for other

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,540
people to finish testing but when it's

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,850
done you'll get a report that looks a

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,070
little bit like this and what do we care

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,720
about here so first of all we're going

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,860
to look at the time to first byte and

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,590
generally that's what we're gonna

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:30,850
optimize and the second piece is the

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:32,650
speed index and what that means is it's

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,810
the average time at which the visible

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,610
parts of your page are displayed so what

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:40,440
people are actually seeing when they're

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:43,420
looking at it that's what we care about

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:48,660
why well that's because what people

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,660
actually see oops sorry

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,870
also in webpagetest you'll get something

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,330
you'll get a water view which is

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,339
basically it's very similar that diagram

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,770
that I showed earlier in the talk but

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,839
it's for your actual site and I won't go

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,970
into that in more detail but you can

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,760
also analyze and see figure out what's

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,140
causing your site to be slow using that

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,850
one of my favorites piece this is the

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,970
filmstrip view so after you run a test

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,730
you can click in here and see over time

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,710
what people are seeing or if they're

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,260
using a browser to look at your website

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,910
so in this case someone's staring at a

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,490
blank screen for the first zero point

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,680
seven seconds and then the background

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,140
comes in here finally the image and then

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,670
some the navigation renders and a few

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,070
extra things and then the cookie bar

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,230
finally at the end so we can see like

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,089
how long it's actually taking for the

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,810
page to show up to someone visiting the

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:50,930
site sorry I jumped kind of quickly

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:53,529
all right other so you you can choose

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,509
their options to choose mobile versions

00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:58,249
or mobile devices even you can also

00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,279
control the network speed and several

00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:04,730
other options it's got quite a few

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:06,709
powerful tools so built into it other

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,920
speed testing tools so groups

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:11,749
I meant to Alice County how many of you

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,100
have heard about GT metrics or used it

00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:19,370
so all right so then I was supposed to

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:23,269
click onto this alright and why do I say

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,350
that mmm that's because I feel like GT

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:26,389
meant to get a lot of the useful

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,490
information you have to either sign up

00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:31,269
for a paid account or do jump through

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:34,100
things or switch screens for GT metrics

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:35,689
and it shows a bunch of things which I

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,999
think lead people down a rabbit hole

00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:40,639
away from what actually matters it's

00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:42,559
really hard to quickly see in GT metrics

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,850
the things that I think matter which is

00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:48,740
your your time to first light I'm not

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,769
even sure sure if they show that right

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,240
off the bat but then also how it's at

00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:54,439
how long it's taken for your page to

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,160
actually render the people that are

00:15:54,439 --> 00:16:00,529
looking at it alright so again just to

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,300
hit that point home again ask yourself

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,920
about your your tool is your tool

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,660
measuring the most important thing and

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,079
showing what your users actually

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,759
experiencing all right let's talk about

00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:14,600
time to first byte which as I said

00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:16,360
earlier is often the bottleneck so what

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,149
factors into it your hosting provider

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,559
and your website implementation and what

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:24,709
does that mean that pretty much means

00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:26,839
your plugins or your theme and your

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:29,990
plugins so let's talk more about the

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,910
first one all right

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,829
oh here's another live demo whoo

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,209
everyone a lot of people have laptops so

00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:37,459
hopefully this works

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:41,660
I've got one more fun little interactive

00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:44,990
part here all right if you go to this

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:48,470
site bit dolly slash live speed you'll

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:53,070
see something that looks like this

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:56,490
including me trying to talk to you and

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:58,800
I'm gonna zoom out here a bit if you've

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,870
got a WordPress site in here or multiple

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,280
you've got client sites friends I'm

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,589
going to reload this once to make sure

00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,440
it's connected go ahead and put in a

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,790
domain come to that URL and it'll start

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,500
in real time we're going to test that

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,240
server response time and send it back to

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,339
all your browser should update it in

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,930
real time and so should this one test as

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,310
many sites as you want throw in a whole

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,010
bunch of client sites and we're going to

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,079
get an idea on average of what people's

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,660
server response times are that time to

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,130
first byte and put in what however many

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,440
sites in there you want it's just going

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,440
to kind of real-time populate and update

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,770
no you don't have to sign in you just go

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:41,690
to this page right here put in the

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,690
domain and click check right here

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:49,980
alright so what are we seeing here well

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,690
one thing that's interesting is we this

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,520
is a histogram so it's showing the

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,070
distribution of the server response

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,670
times and remember what that I said our

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:04,970
goal is 5 500 milliseconds or less that

00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:10,260
is right here most sites are over here

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:13,350
so most sites are not fast and then we

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,370
kind of break it down over there so all

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,370
right thanks for playing

00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:22,070
and the results for this will stay up

00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:25,330
and you can hit other sites for the rest

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:29,779
of the weekend if you like alright

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:32,360
moving on I am I was supposed to show

00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:34,149
that before I flipped over to alright

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,429
let's talk about WordPress hosting

00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:43,580
alright your hosting provider yes

00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:45,409
does it matter yes a lot and bet is

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,330
better hosting the Silver Bullet for

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:51,049
WordPress performance much of the time

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,580
yes it is other times well slow bloated

00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,409
site is slow blow to site it might be

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,100
faster on that are hosting but it might

00:18:54,409 --> 00:19:02,090
not yet be fast so is your hosting

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,830
provider a problem certain providers are

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,450
known to be well optimized consistently

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,789
fast and not really have performance

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,950
issues other hosting providers it made

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:12,529
depends on the plan boxed on a day other

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,139
things server configuration somehow

00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:17,149
hosting provider so some hosting further

00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:20,690
are known to provide D consistently slow

00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:24,289
and others are can and others can be 5

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:28,820
to 10 times slower you know as a more

00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,869
optimized host alright so let me talk up

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,190
a little bit about some of the

00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:35,240
difference between web servers you'll

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:38,509
find on I put up the slide and let's see

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,389
so a lot of hosts will be running

00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:43,730
something called cPanel and usually that

00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,470
has Apache running with it and you'll

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,629
find a large number of hosts running

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:52,580
this but I've found from lots of

00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:54,679
experience that it's generally twice as

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:58,249
slow as a more optimized platform that's

00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,950
running just nginx and PHP fpm so what's

00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:03,440
the takeaway from this is that if your

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,990
hosting provider a cPanel available and

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,249
your site is probably not as fast as it

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:12,529
could be all right

00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:15,139
now here's a checklist so what should

00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:18,710
your hosting provider be doing what what

00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:20,899
factors into performance well a whole

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,820
bunch of things that's a big long list

00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:24,799
well they're supposed to appear bullet

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,590
by bullet I'm not going to talk about

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,650
those because you're probably like that

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,590
right now

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,970
and so what's better than trying to

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,130
figure all that out see if your hosting

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,470
provider it has a door you know where if

00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,210
it's optimized or working right well

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,800
here's a better option for checking your

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,070
hosts how do you know if it's causing

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,170
all or part of your speed problem or if

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,320
they've optimized it well it's me

00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,940
mmm well not hard to do reliably well at

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,180
least not well your site is at your

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,390
current host so try another hosting

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,400
provider how and may put an exact copy

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:03,000
of your site on another optimized

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,980
WordPress host so copying your site to

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,590
new hosts so a lot of hosts will let you

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,780
sign up for 30 days free try it out some

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,340
will even let you sign up for free and

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,290
put up a development site without paying

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,679
so there are definitely some options to

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:19,410
explore out there for doing that so

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,030
different options for moving copying

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,450
your site overs you can use a plugin the

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,850
backup and restore it um better is some

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,550
hosting providers have a migration

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:32,820
plugin that makes it even easier it's

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,610
more host specific and if you can fully

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,260
automate it or you know without even

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,130
needing to install a plug-in yourself

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,740
manually then that's I think ideal here

00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:48,840
are some backup and restore plugins that

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:50,640
give you an option so you can get these

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,730
from the slides later if you would like

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,110
some of the hosting providers have their

00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:01,920
own plugins and blog vault also provides

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:03,660
a they do a branded thing I think this

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,340
copies it to their server and then over

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,860
to your final destination and so there's

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,010
a fuse about hosting provider specific

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,990
branded versions of their plug-in too

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,480
and then we have an import tool which

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,100
I'll try a demo later as well that makes

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,100
it even easier than I think these other

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,679
methods so once you let's say you've

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,170
copied but your site over to a new

00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,340
hosting provider to test it out how

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,400
would you test it you can use

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,140
webpagetest or we have some tools that

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,780
will also help you I'll show you some of

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,350
those later I want to say a word about

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:40,200
shared and dedicated hosting for a VPS

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,210
vs. managed hosting a lot of people I

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,860
think have had

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,130
the conception like oh my shared hosting

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,860
is not performing well if I get a VPS it

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,620
will be faster in some cases that's true

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,809
but I'd like to argue that a VPS or a

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,890
dedicated server is for flexibility and

00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:59,149
not performance and well managed

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:02,960
possibly share it or not platform can

00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:04,760
easily outperform most VPS is what

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,380
flexibility actually means is you just

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,750
bought yourself a system administrative

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,220
job and so unless that's what you want

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,429
to be doing and that might not be the

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:18,200
best option for most people performance

00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:20,720
is actually what you really want my

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,669
friend came up with this idea concept

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,000
called the total cost of hosting so

00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:28,100
often often times better hosting is more

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,830
expensive so is the isn't worth it

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,510
and so then some of you probably know

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,029
Bridget so she actually wrote a blog

00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:38,870
post on this and you can find it up on

00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:40,730
her her page too so she said $25 that's

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,370
what I pays for her hosting and she

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:48,070
thinks as you do many people thinks it

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,070
is expensive is it so she asked people

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,270
and she got a bunch of reactions on

00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:55,909
Twitter and that's her page again you

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,970
can look up the slides later and this is

00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:00,230
what what do you spend $25 a month on is

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:06,340
what she asked everyone and these are

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:06,340
some of the responses she got Donuts

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:14,299
Starbucks

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:16,669
Amy's speaking tomorrow another way and

00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:19,720
one of the best options I think or best

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:19,720
replies was this one

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:29,690
Bridget's final thoughts so your time is

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,910
money you're gonna spend a lot of time

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:36,799
on your website building it clients are

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:39,140
too so so premium hosting isn't worth it

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,670
isn't it if it's an e-commerce site with

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,280
any volume you're making money on it

00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,200
then I definitely say yes his speed and

00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,720
port it to the client and his budget are

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,780
concerned good questions to ask and good

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,090
managed hosting often includes what

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,929
others will upsell such as backups and

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,850
SSL certificate staging features

00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,590
security firewall and technical support

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:06,200
at many of these places is also much

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:08,059
better so I actually put a ranking based

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,669
on my experience of some people might

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:12,260
object to some of this but someone

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:17,840
actually at a recently note told me they

00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:20,540
pay me to see this slide separated so I

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,980
for under $100 starting in under like

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,450
there are other hosts that are more

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,530
premium than this I didn't include them

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,820
on here and there are other there are

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,750
plenty of others I didn't include but

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,049
these are some of the more well-known

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:33,290
ones and one thing I just noticed

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:36,169
recently too is all the ones on this

00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,700
side here are running a custom platform

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:39,740
usually with engine X or something else

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,929
and all these are basically cpanel hosts

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:46,100
at least for a lot of the entry level

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:48,799
one options all right

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,919
but wait someone said it another word

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,559
can't talk you had my host on there and

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:59,059
I think my websites fast why why are

00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:03,919
they in the slow column things to

00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:06,049
consider well ignorance is bliss site

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,520
might already load in two seconds on but

00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:09,700
you just haven't seen it load on one

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,630
second somewhere else

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:16,549
page caching is your site or host you is

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,840
your site or host using caching make

00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,390
sure to test the speed your site while

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,790
you're logged in which often disables

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:27,380
caching and yes maybe it is good enough

00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:34,100
so if you're happy and your clients are

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:35,720
happy and mobile test on your site on

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,100
mobile too with web page

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,260
you can use that option someone asked

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:43,370
earlier test it with a slower connection

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:47,659
and see how it loads then you might be

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:51,320
thinking wow he just spent 20 slides

00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:55,610
talking about hosting yes it is that

00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,980
important this is a feedback I got from

00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:01,280
this is a wordpress group about speeding

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,260
up WordPress and here's some quotes from

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,230
that guy that I talked to and interacted

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,600
with them on that he said he tried all a

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,309
whole bunch of other things and it's

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,780
five days I think you said trying to

00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:18,020
speed up the website and none of his

00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:21,799
efforts worked and so I recommended

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:26,809
actually kinsa to him as an option for

00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:30,400
speeding up a site all right how st.

00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:33,080
final recommendations try before you buy

00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,840
so do not pay for one two three years

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:42,220
hosting at a discounted price it's a

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,220
trap stay on a start on a monthly plan

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,490
and better yet start with a fast host

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,120
that provides a free development

00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:52,730
environment Pantheon flywheel we also

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,030
hold that you get started for free and

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,830
without even needing a credit card

00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:00,440
all right server response times what if

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,210
you've moved your site to faster host

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,350
but it's still a bit slow and you're

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,350
trying to figure out what's going on or

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:09,799
maybe certain pages are slow something

00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:12,559
something is not fast yet then to most

00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:14,210
people that is a black box and you know

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,309
there's no way to figure out what is

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:21,140
going on there so today let's open up

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:24,049
that black box all right first things

00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,730
first though when we're diagnosing speed

00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,340
and performance problems on the site we

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,870
go through a series of steps first we

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,820
need to generate some traffic to the

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:34,549
site or wait for it if it's in

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,830
production and then we need to review

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:38,120
the profiling results I guess I missed a

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,909
step in there you need to put some

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,070
enable a profiler on it first I'm going

00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:46,220
to talk about New Relic today then you

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:48,020
make a change and then you repeat now

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,100
the difference between this

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:57,290
and what a lot of people do or or all

00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,370
they are able to do is when we make a

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,140
change here we're not going to be

00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:03,290
guessing that was the title of my talk

00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,480
to we're gonna be making we're gonna be

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,250
seeing what is actually slowing down the

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,170
site and figuring out what's really

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,460
going on there so we're not just having

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,290
to go through a list of plugins and

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,360
figure out them maybe this is slowing it

00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:17,720
down

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,210
so New Relic New Relic is an application

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,000
performance monitoring tool there is a

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:25,220
free version available the pro version

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,800
is most useful but and there's a free

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:31,100
trial available you do need root level

00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,800
access to install it though some several

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,679
hosting providers actually provide

00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,660
access to it and I personally have

00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,700
diagnosed hundreds of performance issues

00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,730
across sites and very little time thanks

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,620
to New Relic literally in five minutes

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:49,220
or less I can usually tell someone why

00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:51,140
their site is slow using this so this is

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,080
what New Relic looks like once you get

00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:56,540
into it first of all it'll tell you give

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,880
you this overview page under a p.m. will

00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,850
give you a breakdown of how long

00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,920
wordpress spent in PHP actually

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,620
executing code and how long it's spent

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,050
you know getting stuff from the database

00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,880
well that's nice to know and it tells

00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:13,490
you your average response time but it's

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,920
not doesn't really solve our problem so

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,870
WordPress our new relic actually has a

00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,420
really cool feature there's a wordpress

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,920
page here and there's two pages under it

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,260
and one of them is plug-ins and themes

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,760
and if we click on that it's going to

00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,380
give us a breakdown that shows us how

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,380
much time was spent in each of those

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,950
plugins or your theme in the case of

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,540
this test site here there was a a be

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,370
testing plug-in installed that at the

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,900
installed on it that was taking up a

00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:42,800
huge amount of time that's the purple

00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:44,660
and when I talked to me if we found out

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,010
that he actually didn't need it so in

00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,380
this case he could just turn off his

00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:53,270
plug-in and that his site got twice as

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:55,820
fast oh yeah these are some older slides

00:30:53,270 --> 00:31:00,340
but I still see some common plugins

00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,340
often slowing down sites jetpack

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,340
Yoast SEO I've seen it slow down the

00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:09,630
WordPress admin especially in a lot of

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:13,950
cases now I'm not trying to paint these

00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:16,380
plugins and I'll talk about in a poor

00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,000
light actually but I'm just more the

00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,110
fact that there are some common plugins

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,060
out there that could be affecting every

00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,860
performance test and figure it out and

00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,130
I'll tell you more about that in a sec

00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,240
so before using new relic this is kind

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,930
of how I felt when I was trying to

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:39,840
figure out performance issues and then

00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:42,380
afterwards so optimizing oh I forget why

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,430
I put this in here so

00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,600
optimization plugins can affect your

00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:50,220
performance - actually so and they will

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,440
opt a wordpress plugins are just more

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,830
code they're not going to make your raw

00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,890
performance faster and they mostly just

00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:01,980
cover up performance issues I generally

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:05,130
don't recommend them and you don't often

00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,680
need them on better hosting and they can

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:12,510
make your time to first byte actually

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:15,720
worse on a fast host all right some

00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,490
possible exceptions if you heavier site

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,000
you might want a page caching plug-in if

00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:25,380
your host doesn't provide it all right

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,870
so server response time optimization so

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,140
hi I actually new relic is a great tool

00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:35,100
but I don't use it that much anymore and

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,710
until that's that was last year now a

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,420
little over a year ago our servers were

00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,920
quite faster than most WordPress hosts

00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:44,640
but still not as fast as Kinston

00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,590
Pantheon and I was using new relic to

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,390
kind of figure things out but then we

00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,120
went and we upgraded our servers and

00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,860
things got twice as fast that was even

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,770
more than the twenty thirty percent gain

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,990
I expected sites were so fast it wasn't

00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:01,320
necessarily or worth the time to try and

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:03,360
optimize them more so moral the stories

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:08,310
optimizing hosts was even more important

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,920
than I am I realized and I do hosting

00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:13,610
so sites can be sped up quite a bit just

00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,800
by optimizing the server infrastructure

00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:19,320
all right now let's see so we talked

00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,180
about quite a quite a lot about that

00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,590
time to first byte and ISIL emphasize

00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,540
the fact that's a bottleneck for most

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,250
people let's say you've got that

00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:30,420
optimized now the rest of your page

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:33,510
needs to load in your browser so what

00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:36,840
affects that HTTP to make sure your host

00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:38,250
is running HTTP to don't know what that

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,890
is

00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,060
it doesn't require HTTPS which you also

00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:47,250
should have it's been around for a while

00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:51,360
there's some great speed benefits it

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:54,720
compresses things other stuff I'm not

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,420
going to talk about but some WordPress

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,870
hosts are still not running it so check

00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:03,090
and see image compression this is a big

00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,890
one so if your site's loading slowly go

00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,750
back to the those web page tests that I

00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,030
talked about earlier and check out and

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,130
see how big at the bottom if you were to

00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,380
scroll down I didn't show it those

00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:16,260
results scroll down and see how big a

00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:18,870
piece of the pie the images the purple

00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,929
is there and if it's taking up most of

00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:24,120
that circle there then and if you got a

00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,750
poor score if that's not an a there

00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,310
already

00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,600
then you probably want to optimize your

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,460
images and that can make quite a

00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,120
difference in the time it takes for your

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:36,360
page to load this is a cool plugin that

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,870
will resize your plugins on upload and

00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:44,490
also let you do some bulk optimization

00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:47,370
as well you can adjust the JPEG quality

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:49,710
it can convert PNG to JPEG which is

00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:52,110
won't go into those details but just

00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,790
more things for speeding up your images

00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:57,620
so they'll load faster without reducing

00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,620
quality which is important to everyone

00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:04,140
caching all right the last section and

00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,420
is page cache in the solution to your

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,570
performance problems mmm if you have a

00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:14,640
slick time slow time to first byte well

00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:16,410
no and caching is for staylene websites

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,080
with lots of traffic that's really what

00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,850
caching was invented for and what it's

00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,890
in my opinion people

00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:28,000
have different opinions and what it's

00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:31,390
for your site should be fast without

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,340
caching and caching on a slow site or

00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:36,130
server only highest performance an

00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,960
optimally part of the time and only use

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,760
it as the last resort after you've done

00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,880
everything else

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,560
where does page caching fall down your

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,590
WordPress admin it's not going to help

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,380
you there your front-end pages while

00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,670
you're logged in large sites with a lot

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,590
of pages you're not going to be able to

00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:56,680
fill the cache with all your pages on

00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:59,890
your site sites with content that might

00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,380
be customized to the visitor and the

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,840
cache can expire it get clear gets

00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:07,390
cleared or it could be flushed and well

00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,220
after that happens yeah that next

00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:12,550
request it's often gonna be quite slow

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:15,490
so you want your site to be fast without

00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:16,690
a page cache running about page cache

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,760
and this is I think one of the best

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:23,560
articles that I've read about WordPress

00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,800
performance and caching again you can

00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,750
pull these links from the slides later

00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:33,250
so in summary a lot of house do provide

00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:35,320
page caching as well if you can't can't

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,390
get your site under 200 milliseconds and

00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,210
time to first byte you might want it

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,070
cache pages will definitely be faster

00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,480
I'm just gonna skip through these

00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,990
because I want to cover some other stuff

00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,150
in summary measure performance first

00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:51,190
pick a good host or switch to one if

00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,760
it's still slow do some profiling with

00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,680
new relic optimizer images use a plug-in

00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,080
for page caching immediate and I didn't

00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,030
even talk about a CDN but on if you have

00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,210
visitors that are located far away from

00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:06,210
where your actual server is a CDN can

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,590
help speed up load page loads for them

00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,900
and then if you're still having issues

00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,520
ask someone for help and they can often

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:17,020
help you figure out well why is your

00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,400
page loading slowly all right thanks ten

00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,980
minutes all right let's see what we can

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,190
do with ten minutes all right I'll do

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,270
that

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,270
the demo thing though

00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:36,160
that's not it all right I've got a guest

00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:39,739
tab here so I'm gonna go to our website

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,420
and show off a few things here some of

00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:43,299
these things you can use for free and

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:51,140
are useful for helping test your

00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:58,660
performance up all right just going to

00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:58,660
sign up as a and whatever

00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:14,130
hopefully this works alright so I've

00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,740
created a brand new account so if I've

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,750
got a existing site I can start by

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,820
clicking this add existing site here and

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:28,350
I've set up a test site on GoDaddy

00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:31,400
actually I can put in the domain name

00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:37,200
here oops

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:41,400
no it is isn't it I forgot to remove

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:49,010
that well I was testing earlier all

00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:49,010
right let's see give me a sec here

00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,320
well this is my I guess session 10

00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,320
minutes clock is ticking

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,010
whoo-hoo all right

00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,670
alright let's try again

00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,869
okay so I put my domain in here it's

00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:43,069
gonna look up some information on it and

00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:45,079
then I'm just gonna add it to my

00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:46,759
dashboard all it's doing is we're just

00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,769
telling site district about it so we can

00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:52,099
do some stuff with it so I click add

00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:53,539
site here and then if I want to import a

00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:56,710
copy of it I can click the next button

00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:58,730
that says you know install the plug-in

00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:01,160
before I do that I'll just show a couple

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,690
quick things what all I've done is told

00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,309
site district about it I can actually

00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,009
there's a few pages on the left that are

00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:10,069
available to us we can come to this web

00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:12,170
page test one here and if we want we can

00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:13,220
run a new web page test and the benefit

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,720
of this is you don't have to click

00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,940
through and do their like CAPTCHA and

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:21,019
stuff on web page test and I already pre

00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:22,670
configure those options for you to get

00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,349
you know some nice result so I can just

00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,079
click run test and it's gonna submit and

00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:28,970
go ahead and run a test on the site I

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,980
can also do some speed testing on it if

00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,599
I want to crawl through 30 pages on the

00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,769
site to see the server response time

00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,799
throughout the site and then give me a

00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:38,660
good idea of how fast my raw server

00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:40,730
performance is I can just click in here

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,170
and run a test of it there's no page

00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,359
caching so I don't need to click that

00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,160
button and this is going to initialize a

00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,430
test here and it's gonna run through and

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,470
see how fast through different pages I

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,940
don't think I have very many you run out

00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:54,499
of pages that'll just loop through and

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,390
go through another until it gets to 30

00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:59,420
this goes through and we'll test the

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:01,099
pages on the site so you can see kind of

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,880
where it's coming in or right around 600

00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:08,900
700 milliseconds all right I'm gonna

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,690
close that and go back to the summary

00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,119
page here and go back to installing the

00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:16,220
plugin so now I want to actually pull my

00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:21,890
site over and get a full copy of it

00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:24,819
running and I realized that I don't

00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,819
remember the password

00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,880
oh that's incog where's my regular

00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:38,340
window here it is so I'm gonna pull that

00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:40,550
out of my password manager know if I can

00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,550
type

00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,310
room

00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:56,940
all right this will go and login to my

00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:00,570
site at GoDaddy and install the plugin

00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:03,530
or our site district plug-in there and

00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:06,780
then in a few steps that'll let us

00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,580
import the site and then we can run a

00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,370
couple tests on it so I'll just click

00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,680
here click again and it's going to go

00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:16,620
off and start importing it well I do

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,850
that duplicate my tab come back let's

00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:23,370
check out the the speed testing results

00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:25,440
so average speed on zoom out a bit so

00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,210
we're gonna see this better so for 30

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,700
requests to the site on GoDaddy we got

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,890
650 milliseconds for the time to first

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,390
byte that's pretty fast it's basically a

00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:38,130
brand new WordPress installed with it

00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:40,290
just a couple things installed and the

00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,310
web page test is still running we

00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:43,260
probably won't be able to see those

00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,780
results because it's waiting behind 21

00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,510
others but it did go off I could

00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,590
probably try to run another one at a

00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,130
different location

00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:59,550
let's try Denver mmm

00:42:53,130 --> 00:43:02,640
maybe that one no I don't know why that

00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:06,120
parts not working but live demos fun

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,870
stuff alright so this is coming over and

00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,550
how we doing on time almost I got about

00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,770
five minutes I'll let this finish let me

00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:16,140
go ahead and take a few questions

00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,810
I guess well this runs a little I'll

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:26,880
come back and show off the stuff really

00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:35,130
yes how long does a test take sorry to

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:38,160
run it which tests so it usually it

00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:40,320
depends how fast your site is but to hit

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,240
30 pages on the site could take a few

00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,930
seconds and pretty much under a minute

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,100
though is typically okay you can come

00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:49,440
find me after you're with more questions

00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,360
too all right I've got a copy of the

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,370
site imported now so I actually I have a

00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,770
full copy already imported over and

00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:58,740
we've got we'll let you review and this

00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,960
will load up a side-by-side view of both

00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,430
of the pages the a copy on site district

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,990
and the one on your original provider

00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,450
you can click this a few times to

00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:15,060
to see what a full page load looks like

00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:17,520
in the browser so you can see there's

00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,760
quite a difference there and we can also

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,490
run that crawl which will go through 30

00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,500
pages on on each of the servers

00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:30,030
well that one finished already so

00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,590
average response time I think that's a

00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,480
little generous I think it's a little

00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,760
bit slower than that but you can see the

00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,550
difference like 41 I think we have 650

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,500
before so let's say let's double that

00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,300
because that test is running close to

00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,970
our server even then that's still like 8

00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:51,300
times faster exact same site copy of it

00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:52,860
various Lightspeed good question um I've

00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,800
played around with it I touched it it

00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:58,500
out a bit and Lightspeed definitely

00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,780
makes this is faster than Apache but

00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,580
I've still seen like on the servers that

00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,860
runs on I'll come back to a site later

00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,660
and it'll just load really slowly at

00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,300
least that first time it might warm up

00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,560
but I'm not seen as good at performance

00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:22,410
so that I do with engine X and

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:24,690
well-configured PHP F p.m. yes that

00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:27,119
doesn't it might help a bit if there's a

00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,850
lot of load on the server from Apache

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,820
handling static assets it might affect

00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:35,369
it but generally it's it's also still

00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:38,700
twice as slow for rendering that main

00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:41,910
page for a WordPress alright so those

00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:45,240
are the results back so you know people

00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:53,810
are like mmm my truck so the point of

00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:57,500
this was not as much to let's see I

00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:57,500
can't find my tabs

00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:04,350
I was gonna go back to the demo there we

00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,350
go

00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,970
that was the demo the point of that

00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,830
wasn't really to show like oh hey our

00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:14,420
hosting is that great really the message

00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:16,590
I want to try to drive home is that like

00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,800
perform hosting does make a huge

00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:21,780
performance difference there are other

00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,290
hosts out there kids - Pantheon that are

00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,330
performed very well or very fast you've

00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:29,070
got if your site's running slow put a

00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,630
copy of your site on on one of these

00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:34,230
other hosts and try it out just to see

00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:35,490
the difference and so and then you know

00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,900
if it's still running slow do some

00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,970
profiling on it to figure out what's

00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,770
really causing the problems all right

00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:58,020
any other questions looks like I've got

00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:59,490
like one minute all right so so CDN is

00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,070
something that sits on top of your

00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,710
hosting and it just does a cat a level

00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:06,420
of caching above your hosts often times

00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:10,020
for images and other stuff like that a

00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:12,900
CDN CloudFlare such as cloud for bunny

00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,940
CDN or other CD ends will not make your

00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,830
server faster or won't won't speed up

00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,170
your site in some cases it'll just cover

00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:21,630
up the problem but it's not really it's

00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,790
like I said earlier a CDN is really if

00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,140
you have people that are located far

00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,570
away from your server and you want the

00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:30,110
pages to load faster for them all right

00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,110
let's do one more

00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,839
yes so what I demoed right there at the

00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:53,480
end was actually copying an entire

00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,980
WordPress site you know over so we just

00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,109
pulled we pulled the entire thing

00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,300
database and files over and with our

00:47:57,109 --> 00:48:01,880
tool and like I talked about earlier you

00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,560
want to try another provider there you

00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,410
can use a backup and restore plug-in or

00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:09,230
some of the sites have plugins that will

00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:10,069
help us basically assisted migration WP

00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:13,400
engine has one

00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:17,569
I think liquid web might have one so and

00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:19,099
so on yeah so Jason talking about

00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:21,079
performance tomorrow too so if you

00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:25,790
haven't had enough of it come to his

00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:27,950
talk alright one more so if you pulled

00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:31,640
out site over from GoDaddy on that holds

00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:33,560
your program to a site don't you still

00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:38,150
need their plugins to make their site

00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:40,280
work so some hosting providers let me

00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:44,119
see if I'm getting the question right

00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,859
here do if you pull a site over from

00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:47,990
GoDaddy or somewhere else will you still

00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:50,630
need their plugins to make it work some

00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:54,050
provider some hosts add some extra

00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:56,720
plugins oftentimes their performance or

00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:59,480
server related if you switch hosts those

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,099
plugins you one typically don't need and

00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,280
to probably don't want because they can

00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:06,020
actually cause issues some plus some

00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,270
places provide like other marketing type

00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:11,119
plugins a lot of all that stuff will

00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:12,619
typically come over with you on some of

00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,390
them just might might not work anymore

00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,890
the ones that don't work anymore usually

00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,500
the ones that are not necessary so it's

00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:20,599
not usually an issue you know you can if

00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,480
you move your whole WordPress site over

00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:25,160
do it a new place then it's usually

00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,619
going to work exactly the same it's just

00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,750
that the speed will be different all

00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:33,020
right

00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:35,500
there's my timer right there so thanks
