Most of us create content because we’re told we should, but not many of us know why.

	00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,530
so

00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,970
whoa

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,580
thank you

00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,400
[Applause]

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,200
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,910
rethinking blogging for businesses so I

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,279
was explaining a little bit before we

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,689
were just chatting or in fact I didn't

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,490
actually officially meet you but we were

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,619
chatting beforehand about the different

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,660
types of blogging for businesses so

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,860
there are some people who blog for their

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,690
business and they actually make money

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,310
just straight from their blog so that's

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,350
the people that you know that maybe they

00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,210
make money from affiliate links or they

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,300
make money from selling ad space on

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,489
their blog but then there's the someone

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,190
stalking me there's also the types of

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,379
people who have blogs that attract

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,120
customers and so people are blogging for

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,800
the sake of putting content out there

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,539
that ranks in search engines and that

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,370
performs on social media and they get

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,260
customers interested in their business

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,530
from that so the latter is what we're

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,390
going to be talking about mostly today

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,260
so before we dive in I just want to

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,760
introduce myself

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,160
again just briefly I know thank you for

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,170
introducing me my name is Cameron if you

00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,880
would like to tweet about the session or

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,340
anything like that my handle is at the

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,409
bottom there as well as the hashtag for

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,400
word camp santa clarita so you can do

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,860
that that's gonna be at the bottom of

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,450
all of my slides so yeah definitely

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,010
don't feel like you have to rush to

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,170
write anything down you can tweet about

00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,850
this session or ask me any questions or

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,500
anything that you want or just comment

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,540
on it and I think we'll also have time

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,080
later I can answer any questions later

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,640
as well so I know no one came here to

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,810
hear me talk about myself I definitely

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,060
don't want to like belabor this point

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,640
but I think introducing my background

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,230
will help serve with some helpful

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,150
context for the the rest of the

00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,250
presentations so a little bit about my

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,350
background I have been in the digital

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,900
marketing world for about eight years a

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,900
bulk of that time has been spent at

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,280
scorpion so if anyone is local to Santa

00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,070
Clarita hopefully I think some of you

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,170
probably at least are scorpion is local

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,940
to Santa Clarita they've been in the in

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,370
the area for a long time so I was there

00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,860
for about six and a half years my job

00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,959
there was leading a team of search

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,580
engine optimisation professionals so

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,860
some of them were content developers

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,810
some of them were a local SEO

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,209
specialists some of them were SEO

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,769
strategist but what does that mean so I

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,360
want to err on the side of explaining

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,010
everything because I know it's beginners

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,560
day I don't want to assume that anyone

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,060
does or doesn't know anything so if I

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,110
feel like I'm if you feel like I'm

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,370
belaboring a point

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,770
just I want to err on the side of

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,630
explaining everything so search engine

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,130
optimization and content marketing what

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,220
does that all mean it essentially means

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,720
that I was responsible for the team that

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,250
was trying to get people's websites to

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,140
show up in Google when you perform a

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,670
search you know you want to you want to

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,980
be able to find relevant helpful

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,390
information there's two sides to the

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,920
search engine there's the paid side

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,590
where you pay per click

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,970
that's PPC and then there's the organic

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,900
side which is what my team was

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,370
responsible for

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,530
so after scorpion I went to work at Moz

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,850
Moz is an SEO software company so it was

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,830
pretty cool to get to work there because

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,690
I used their tools when I was at

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,720
scorpion so then I got a chance to do

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,270
content marketing and SEO for Moz which

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,280
is awesome and now as my contract with

00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,140
Moz is winding down I'm working for my

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,760
own business that I started soapbox ly

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,220
and we're doing the same thing so doing

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,989
SEO and content marketing and doing all

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,780
of these things producing content so

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,120
that our customers get to attract their

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,739
ideal customers and then I also blog for

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,920
industry publications like search engine

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,590
journal and LSA and insider so why do I

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,480
mention all of that so I mentioned all

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,060
of that because I have spent a lot of

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,610
time blogging for businesses like an

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,350
inordinate amount of time so after a

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,459
while though I kind of started to wonder

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:51,120
like is this even making an impact are

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,830
people even reading these blogs and if

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,650
so if they are reading them how does

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,930
that even help my clients business you

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,640
know when I first got started in digital

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,090
marketing it was pretty soon after

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,560
college soon after I graduated and I

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,140
don't know if you all remember how you

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,180
were back in that stage but I was just

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,160
happy to get paid and I was happy that I

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,630
had a job I was happy that someone was

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,330
giving me a paycheck I didn't really

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,859
question why I was blogging our clients

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,019
were paying us money and I was like this

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,900
is great I'm getting paid to blog and

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,790
I'm not questioning why but then after a

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,800
while I started to think of like care

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,330
these clients are paying good money for

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,400
these blog posts and what are they

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,169
getting out of this I started to think

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,390
like are people reading this stuff is it

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,950
performing like any good business owner

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,020
or marketer you're gonna have to start

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,789
asking the question are you making more

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,050
money on this than you're spending on it

00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:41,999
right because otherwise you won't be in

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,129
business for very long

00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:46,679
so who is this talk for I think

00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:47,879
hopefully this talk is gonna hit on you

00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,019
know all different types of people it's

00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,569
gonna be relevant to a lot of different

00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,579
groups so I think number one it can be

00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:55,229
relevant for business owners so if you

00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,449
own your own business or your own your

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,429
own maybe side house little side project

00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:01,499
hopefully it's gonna be relevant for you

00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:03,179
because blogging can really help your

00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:04,919
business attract potential customers

00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:07,199
whether you're doing the blogging

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,969
yourself or maybe you're freelancing or

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,610
hiring out and having someone do the

00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:13,649
blogging for you it's also helpful for

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,449
marketers people who are in the

00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:17,819
marketing industry so if you're

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,759
responsible maybe you work at a business

00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:24,329
doing the marketing you can feel free to

00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,219
go and no it's okay hi welcome

00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,860
I know it's always awkward to walk right

00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:30,719
in but no that's the easiest way don't

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,459
no don't be sorry that's the easiest way

00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:34,829
to get to your seat so it's also for

00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,839
marketers and it's also for bloggers

00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:38,759
obviously I mean this talk is rethinking

00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,919
vlogging for businesses so it's gonna

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,509
also be helpful for people who are

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,679
getting paid money to write blogs for

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,469
businesses hopefully we can do it

00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:48,449
smarter and better and hopefully have a

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:51,059
better result and it's also for people

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,469
who do search engine optimization so

00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,449
these are the people maybe they're not

00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:56,489
doing the content directly but they're

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,800
in charge and responsible for making

00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,329
websites show up prominently in search

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,699
engines like Google so I think it could

00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:05,669
be relevant for any and all combination

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,349
of these types of people so this was my

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,389
hypothesis when I started putting this

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:13,619
presentation together my hypothesis was

00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:15,419
that business blogs are broken so how

00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:16,739
business blogging typically works it's

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,499
pretty simple this is usually my

00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:21,479
experience with clients they will hear

00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:23,069
somehow that blogging is what they

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,439
should be doing so maybe they're talking

00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,119
to a friend their friend says hey man

00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,739
I've gotten a lot of I've gotten a lot

00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,059
of potential clients from blogging

00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:32,069
people are finding my blogs and search

00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:34,259
engines or on social media I'm getting a

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,419
lot of attention that way or maybe the

00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,860
business owner is struggling to get new

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,269
customers and they're doing a lot

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,159
googling how did you get new customers

00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:43,259
how to get more clients I'm struggling I

00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:45,539
need I need help and they'll probably

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,610
stumble on a blog on Forbes or something

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,929
like that and has a list of these things

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,429
you should do to get more clients and

00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,939
more customers and blogging is usually

00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:52,079
on them

00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,059
I mean you've probably all heard that

00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,169
blogging is a good thing to do but not a

00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:57,240
lot of us know exactly

00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,889
why're we can't really articulate okay

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,499
here blogging is important but why

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,999
exactly is this so important so a

00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:05,129
business owner usually hears that it's

00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:07,139
important then they decide okay I'm

00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:09,659
either gonna pay a blogger to do it

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,180
maybe I pay you know someone on Elance

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:13,770
or whatever text broker all those

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,349
different freelance platforms are today

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,180
or someone who just wants to blog for

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:20,249
the business or they decide you know I

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,080
know my business best no one knows my

00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:23,789
business better than me so I'm gonna do

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,539
it I'm going to reserve some time in my

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,669
day to blog

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:29,400
so regardless of who's doing it blog

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,080
start to go up on the website Adam a

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,089
regular cadence or maybe a spotty

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,680
cadence depending on you know how much

00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,990
time you've left for yourself I know for

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,610
me it's kind of hard to get you know

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,129
regular blog posts up just because we're

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,509
all so busy that's it's a thing that

00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:45,240
takes a lot of effort and a lot of time

00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:47,849
so that's how it typically works but is

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,759
this even doing anything so I decided to

00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:53,069
test it now before I get into the

00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,680
details of the tests that I ran I wanted

00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,139
to kind of explain why I ran a test so

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,180
throughout the course of all the time

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,930
I've been in digital marketing I have

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,639
been asked by lots of upset clients why

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,620
am I not getting any traffic so I

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,870
usually end up getting pulled into these

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,370
situations where a client is saying I

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,770
have been blogging or I've been paying

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,599
your company to blog for me for three

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,490
months or six months or twelve months or

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,800
even longer sometimes and they're just

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,870
frustrated they're wondering why after

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,909
all this time exchanging money to get

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,289
these blog posts among other things why

00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:27,210
they are not getting the traffic that

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:29,159
they thought they would get and so

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,740
usually what I end up having to do is I

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,449
perform a content audit so what I do is

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,010
I go into their Google Analytics I try

00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:37,110
to see if it's true because sometimes

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,789
clients you know if you all work with

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,490
clients sometimes they freak out over

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,169
small things we all have our that could

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,500
be a talk in and of itself on managing

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,699
clients oh my goodness but definitely

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,079
one of those situations where you want

00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,310
to corroborate it you want to make sure

00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,899
that the data backs up what they're

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,899
saying so you go into Google Analytics

00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,910
and you try to see okay is this actually

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,519
true are they getting any blog views if

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,589
so where the blog Keys coming from how

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,089
popular is their blog you know what have

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,550
we been doing for them is it successful

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:07,620
and usually what I find is sadly no

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,259
sadly it's not been successful they have

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,459
maybe

00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:11,109
one or two blog posts that are

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:13,359
performing well in search engines and

00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:15,009
the rest are just falling flat no one is

00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:16,540
finding them maybe they got a couple

00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:18,549
hits on social media the first day it

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,079
was posted and then it kind of trails

00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:21,939
off if you've ever seen like Google

00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,009
Analytics you know post it on social in

00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:26,619
them it just dies after that and there's

00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:29,439
no traffic so that's been my experience

00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:31,179
in the past and that's been my

00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:33,369
experience in the past so I wanted to

00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,379
test to see if this was true on a on a

00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:37,689
broad scale if this wasn't just my

00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:40,739
personal experience I wanted to see if

00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:43,509
this was true of most business blogs so

00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:46,149
this is the result so the test that I

00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:49,600
ran I found that 65 percent of business

00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:51,729
blogs don't get any organic traffic now

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,799
again by organic I mean specifically

00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:55,899
visits originating from a search engine

00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,509
like Google and not the ad portion the

00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,879
organic portion so I have this shortened

00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:02,709
link up here if you want to visit it you

00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,389
can view and I'll post my slides too so

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:06,129
you could grab this link later as well

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:08,019
but it's actually it's just like a

00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:10,239
longer write-up of my methodology behind

00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,039
the study it's not something where I

00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:14,169
evaluated millions and millions of

00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,419
business websites that would take time

00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:18,339
that no one if no one has but what I

00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:21,039
tried to do is grab a representative

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,689
sample so I grabbed you know a bunch of

00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,850
different websites from businesses

00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:27,489
across the country all different types

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,929
lawyers and plumbers and dental offices

00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:30,999
from all different cities throughout the

00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,980
US don't like the qualifying factor was

00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:35,379
that they had a blog I wanted a true

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,199
sample of the state of business blogging

00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:40,600
today and what i found was that 65% of

00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:44,139
them they don't get any organic traffic

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,559
and i thought that was really sad an 85%

00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:49,239
get low or no organic traffic that's so

00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,009
much people are spending so much money

00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:53,049
on these blogs and if not money then

00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,600
they're spending their own time on these

00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:58,299
blogs what's the deal what gives what is

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,069
the problem here well i think i can

00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:01,629
chalk it up to three main things and

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,579
that these are at least the theories

00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:05,229
that i've come up with over the course

00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,879
of you know my years in the industry i

00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:10,839
think that these serve is like the three

00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,970
kind of main pillar problems so number

00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,799
one i think business vlogs tend to not

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,909
get the organic traffic that they could

00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,919
be getting just because of their

00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:20,679
thinking of their blog the wrong way

00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,000
people do consume business blog content

00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,460
people can find

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,890
and enjoy it and want to read it and it

00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,450
can perform well but people tend to

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,670
think or businesses tend to think that

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,960
their blog is is a publication like the

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,610
signal or the New York Times or

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,860
something like that and we'll dive into

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,080
each of these sections a little bit

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,400
further so number two I think the other

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,190
thing that's wrong is that business

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,480
blogs tend to either oversell themselves

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,800
or they kind of use their content to

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,930
undersell themselves and they don't talk

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,520
about themselves at all and then the

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,500
third main problem I think is that

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,050
business blogs tend to be a little

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,600
siloed they tend to be a little to

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,700
separate their disjointed they're not

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,990
really connected to a main business goal

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,990
so these are I think the three main

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,580
problems and by diving into each problem

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,400
and then exploring the solutions I think

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,140
we're going to be able to start blogging

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,270
smarter rather than harder for hire

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,220
impact so that's going to serve as kind

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,800
of like the outline for the remainder of

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,200
this so number one I think business

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,390
blogs need to realize that you are not

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,520
the New York Times and that sounds maybe

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,930
a little bit harsh but it's not meant to

00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,430
be it's definitely not it's just meant

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,100
to say that people don't consume

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,680
business blog content the same way that

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,660
they consume content and like the New

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,960
York Times or the signal or whatever you

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,880
read so businesses tend to have these

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,839
assumptions based on how they think

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,000
people find their content so the number

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,230
one assumption that I have experienced

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,089
with business owners is that they

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,370
believe that people are going to find

00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:51,040
all of their business blog content from

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,450
their home page so the idea is something

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,040
like you know someone wakes up on a

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,200
Sunday morning and brews their coffee

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,260
and sits down with their tablet and they

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,510
go mmm let's go to joe plumbers site and

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,070
find the blog and let's just peruse and

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,990
let's have a good Sunday morning and

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,570
just browse through all of these blog

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,460
topics so that's how you would read the

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,110
paper but it's not how you read business

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,290
blog content it's a little bit different

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:17,440
so no people tend to not consume

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,810
business blog content that way second of

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,640
all people tend to assume businesses

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,500
tend to assume that people are finding

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,630
all of my blog content through like an

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,700
RSS feed or sign up to subscribe and

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,110
there are some business models that lend

00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,720
really well to this I mean those people

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,060
that have just general interest blogs

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,209
and people sign up to receive all of

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,529
their content and that's

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:39,170
great but if you're talking about a

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,449
business like a law for a law firm or a

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,040
dental office or a hospital or something

00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,899
like that people aren't gonna be like

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,839
ooh can't we wait to see what my dentist

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:51,170
posts next on their blog so people tend

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,600
to not not find it that way either

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,220
so the third kind of way the assumption

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,470
is that people will find my business

00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,720
blog content through social media and

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,699
now this is definitely not a knock on

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,199
social media ID it's not meant to be at

00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,179
all because social media is a valuable

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,009
way I think to get exposure and to

00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,949
engage with your audience and to engage

00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:11,990
with your community but it tends to be

00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,519
that organic reach on platforms

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,429
especially like Facebook and Instagram

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,230
is going way down those types of

00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:20,449
platforms are really trying to emphasize

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,100
content that's posted by you know

00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:24,589
friends and family and people that you

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,619
tend to engage a lot with rather than a

00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:29,720
business so that tends to be a little

00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:31,490
bit different and it's also usually the

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,679
fact that people are following you and

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,240
seeing your content on social media if

00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,889
they already know about you they've

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,660
liked your page they're already aware of

00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:40,519
you so these businesses if they're

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,079
posting on social media they're not

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,149
gonna have as good of a chance of

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,860
reaching new people new potential

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,720
customers it's usually those people that

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,829
have already known about them and engage

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,329
them so no usually not so how do people

00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,679
find business blog content there's got

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,319
to be some way people find to your

00:14:54,679 --> 00:15:00,259
business blog content so people will

00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:02,509
find your content via search via search

00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:05,089
engines and that happens when they need

00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:07,790
it so when you have a question who do

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:10,009
you turn to I mean I personally like

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,600
probably most of you turn to Google I

00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:14,240
mean I could be sitting on the couch

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,299
right next to my husband and have a

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,879
question and I don't ask him I pull out

00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:22,009
my phone and I and I google it I mean

00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:27,410
not always I mean I you know I talked to

00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:29,269
him I I Google a lot of stuff and I

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:33,170
think the numbers kind of corroborate

00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:36,139
that I mean Google says 5 billion guys 5

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,119
billion queries per day are searched in

00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:40,850
Google and that's 2 trillion per year

00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:43,220
and that's insane so if you think about

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,870
that even if your business say you're

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,480
you know I keep using the same examples

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,950
just for ease but like if you run a

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,450
dental office or whatever

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,880
you know not all of those queries are

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,130
going to be related to dental offices

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,620
and dental related things but even a

00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,500
small sliver of billions is still a lot

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,200
there are still people asking questions

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,000
about what you do and what your business

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:08,180
offers so this is the difference between

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,620
inbound and interruption when it comes

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,040
to the different types of marketing

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,290
inbound says I'm going to create really

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,750
relevant high quality content that

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:20,180
performs it's always on it's always

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,130
accessible it's always available to my

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,329
potential customers and then when

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,860
someone has a question

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,170
you know they Google something and if

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,699
your content is you know optimized well

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,980
and it's you know relevant and

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:31,610
high-quality they're going to be able to

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,860
find it

00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,380
so people your potential customers are

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,839
finding your content when they need it

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,579
whereas interruption marketing is a

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,410
little bit different interruption

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:43,910
marketing kind of sounds negative again

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,500
there's a time and a place for all of

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,839
this stuff this is definitely not an

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,389
organic search only kind of kind of a

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,120
talk but interruption marketing says

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:54,649
that I am going to put my message in

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,440
front of you whether you're asking for

00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,540
it or not that's an ad right whereas

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,430
inbound you're posting content and

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,079
people are finding it when they want it

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,240
so the people that are visiting and

00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,740
viewing this content it's they're

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,689
viewing it on their time so they're more

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,880
qualified they're more likely to engage

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,230
with your business and be interested in

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,000
what you have to say because they find

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,530
they found it it was their idea

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,880
rather than an ad that you're kind of

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,230
you know putting in front of someone

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,699
when they're weren't asking for it or

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,630
prepared for it or they didn't even want

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:26,179
it so how does that change the way our

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,459
businesses blog well I have some tips

00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,530
hopefully this is gonna be actionable so

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,390
the first group of tips kind of centers

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,520
on writing content that answers

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,400
questions your ideal customers are

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,290
asking so in order to be able to do that

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,160
you have to know who your ideal

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,330
customers are now I talk with a lot of

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,710
businesses and depending on how mature

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,900
the business is or maybe they're just

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,340
getting started a lot of times people

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,770
don't know they just say well everyone

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,140
is my target customer and that is not

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,669
the right answer so you have to narrow

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,500
and it's okay if you don't know yet it's

00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,240
totally cool if you don't know yet just

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,790
work on getting there work on

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,419
identifying who your ideal customers are

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,609
how

00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:07,309
old are they what are they like where do

00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:09,169
they live ask questions like that and if

00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,519
you do already have a business start to

00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:12,590
kind of focus on maybe you've never

00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,749
thought about what all of your customers

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,460
have in common just look at your your

00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:18,379
customers that you've had before and try

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,269
to identify common themes all my

00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:23,059
customers tend to be you know between

00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:24,590
the ages of 25 and 36 and my customers

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,720
tend to be you know it's always the men

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,309
calling me and you know you just want to

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,499
be able to identify who your ideal

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:31,940
customers are so that you can talk to

00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:33,830
them because if you want to create

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,889
relevant content you got to know who

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,269
you're creating content for so the next

00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:40,940
question you'd want to ask is what

00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:44,779
problems does my business solve for them

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,580
so I can use myself as an example you

00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,830
know my clients come to me at a time

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,690
when they're facing a problem of let's

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,179
say for example they just started a

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,220
business and they have no idea they know

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:56,509
that you know organic and search engines

00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,159
and all that stuff is important but they

00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:00,139
have no idea where to get started with

00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,759
that and so they come to me with that

00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,169
problem like I have a business and I

00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,419
want to get attention to it this is my

00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:07,639
pride need help so that's the problem

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:09,710
that my business solves for people so if

00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:11,450
you have a business or you work for

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,039
someone you know a business owner and

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,809
you're blogging for them you're gonna

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,509
want to try to ask this question what

00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:19,279
problems does that business solve and

00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:21,259
from that you're going to be able to

00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,899
create a lot of or find a lot of great

00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:25,669
content ideas just from thinking and

00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:28,249
focusing on the problems that the

00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:29,929
business is solving and if you're having

00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:32,330
trouble with this go through your emails

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,739
and contact forms to identify common

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,700
questions I think this is a really

00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:39,289
underrated tactic and tip so the times

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,059
I've done this before it's been really

00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,859
interesting I've gone through my you

00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,480
know my clients contact forums just

00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,909
because you know weird it's always a

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,590
good idea to go to their for for blog

00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:50,509
posts ideas so I'd go through there and

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,519
like man everyone who's contacting them

00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:54,619
tends to ask the same question and

00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,259
that's addressed nowhere on the website

00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:58,909
so bingo that's a great idea for a blog

00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:01,820
topic things that people are commonly

00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:03,379
asking so if you have a CRM or you you

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,389
know however you keep track of your

00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:07,309
client or potential client communication

00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:08,509
definitely go through that go through

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,039
those old logs of all that old

00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:11,929
information and see what common

00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,989
questions and pain points people are

00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:16,190
asking you about think about what's most

00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:19,310
misunderstood about

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,600
industry you guys are probably all in in

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,950
an industry where you know if you

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,870
explain it to a friend or a family

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,480
member there's a misunderstanding like

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,130
no that's not what SEO is like you

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,290
probably all have that thing that people

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,850
just don't get about what you do and

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,800
they just don't understand it's really

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,420
confusing to people who aren't in your

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,340
industry so think about those things

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,440
think about the things that people just

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,870
commonly misunderstand about your

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,210
industry and use your blog post as an

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:47,060
opportunity to clarify that for people

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,100
say okay people don't understand you

00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,380
know this particular thing about SEO

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,670
well coold no one tends to understand

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,310
that I'm gonna write a blog post about

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,600
it that's immediately relevant content

00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,850
because you know that that always

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,670
confuses people it's a perfect idea for

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,590
writing a blog post think about what the

00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,780
biggest barriers are to someone seeking

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,760
your product or service so there's a lot

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,020
of different industries obviously and

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,880
there's a lot of different problems in

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,560
that each industry solves but it's

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,360
definitely a good idea to think about

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,160
those things about your industry that

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,980
people just tend to not like right off

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,480
the surface so you know oh I don't want

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,010
to go buy a car because I don't want to

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,860
have to haggle with someone or you know

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,630
those common barriers that someone has

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,820
when they think about a certain type of

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,970
business so use your blog posts as a

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,380
chance to kind of you know talk about

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,210
those things in a way that's like I'm

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,040
gonna I'm gonna raise your objection and

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,230
answer it and address it before you even

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,000
have a chance to raise it so use that

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,640
just think about these in terms of

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,490
creating blog topics and thinking about

00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,910
ideas so the next group of tips is going

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:52,310
to surface or Center on how to focus on

00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,680
things that people are searching so you

00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:57,770
not only want to know your customers and

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,150
you not only want to get to know who

00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,950
they are and what they do and how they

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,560
act and the questions they have you also

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,690
want to understand that exact words

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,910
they're using to search for what you

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,440
offer because I know for me I mean there

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,570
are definitely things that I assume

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,850
about my industry you know I say oh

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,410
everyone knows what SEO is or everyone

00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,090
knows what content marketing is and

00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,160
that's not the case so it's probably

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,870
things in your industry that you assume

00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,700
like Oh everyone knows what blah blah

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,890
blah is that specific thing in your

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,960
industry but you realize later like oh

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,430
that's jargon my potential customers

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,020
don't actually know what that is

00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,330
so keyword research is

00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,220
a great way to actually find out how

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,470
people are searching that exact words

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,530
and phrases people are using to kind of

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,270
find information about your business so

00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:44,030
one way to do that is just using Google

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:47,090
itself now it's pretty cool I typed in

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,320
an example here of Auto Detailing so

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,150
there's no boring industries you can

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,550
even blog if you're you know have an

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,310
auto teeth detailing business so in this

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,140
example I type in Auto Detailing and on

00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,850
the Google search results page itself

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,790
there's this thing now called the people

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:04,370
also asked box and it's just a such a

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,800
great idea for like getting ideas for

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,990
blog post ideas these are related

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,490
questions to what you typed in so it's

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,380
amazing you can do this with pretty much

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,600
any word or phrase and a lot of times

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,660
Google will surface this kind of

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,970
accordion list of questions related to

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,610
it and these are great ideas for coming

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,500
up with blog posts so another cool thing

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,720
if you see this you can click on these

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,370
and it'll just keep expanding so if you

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,470
click on one it'll show you like five

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,540
more so there's a lot of different

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:35,630
questions that can serve as good ideas

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,910
for blog posts and another tool it's a

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,380
free tool I love it it's called answer

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,350
the public if you've never heard of it

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,510
it's free up to a point I think it's

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,490
like a freemium type of product but if

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,590
you go to answer the public comm and do

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,260
a similar thing what you can do is type

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,600
in I use the same example Auto Detailing

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,940
I typed in Auto Detailing and what you

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,980
get is a bunch of questions people have

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,650
typed into a search engine that include

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,180
that word so if you're a dentist type in

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,980
dentist and see you know what things

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,200
people are searching related to dentist

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,540
if you're you know whatever you are type

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,040
it in and answer the public will give

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,980
you a huge long list of a bunch of

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,750
different things and it gives you two

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,070
different formats this is like the

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,080
pretty format that everyone's like

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,850
really impressed by but it's so hard to

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,770
read so I would switch over to the data

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,120
version and just get like the list

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,340
version so if you're trying to impress a

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,340
client yeah I use the RAM the right-hand

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,660
side I use that one for clients but the

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,220
left-hand side is like the actual

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,350
readable version so answer the public

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,880
it's awesome another one that I love is

00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:38,210
another free tool it's called

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,120
FAQ fox and if you google search FAQ fox

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,490
it'll come up with the URL for this tool

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,320
so what you can do is you

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,140
- again to use the same example Auto

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,150
Detailing so what I did was type this in

00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,340
and what this tool does is it scans a

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,440
bunch of forums like Reddit and Cora and

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,230
it's great because it'll come up with a

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,600
list of forum threads where people are

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,510
talking about that topic whatever topic

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,200
that you put in so this is a great place

00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:08,390
to go and find blog topic ideas because

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,010
usually people use forums and they go

00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,770
and ask people stuff on forums when they

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,360
can't find their answer on Google so

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,220
that's like bingo that's a great idea

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,840
for blog topic ideas because no one has

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,990
answered it yet you have no competition

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,960
it's amazing so use FAQ Fox to go and

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,760
find blog topic ideas based on what

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,640
people are searching about your industry

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,730
in forums and then so we've kind of

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,280
moved on to this third pillar here even

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,900
though SEO is is what I do I'm like

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,940
spending the least amount of time on

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,340
like the technical aspect of it because

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,050
so much of performing well in search

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,420
engines is about just having high

00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:46,550
quality relevant content that your

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,559
audience wants to read and that's the

00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,730
most most important part Google has

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,440
gotten so much better

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,510
surfacing content that's actually good

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,240
instead of just matching a list of

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,770
ranking factors so SEO is still

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,200
important though because Google is still

00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,700
a machine Google is not a human even

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,590
though it's trying to be Google is

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,300
trying to replicate what a human

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,100
searcher would pick but it's still a

00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,020
machine so there are certain things we

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,760
have to do to make sure our blogs are

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,980
accessible and that Google understands

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,929
them not just our audience right so what

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,429
I would suggest is using one of these

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,440
plugins if you're not already I

00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:20,570
personally used Yoast I think it's great

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,640
it's one of those other freemium type of

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,110
products and the free version is totally

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,750
sufficient but what it does is it makes

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,520
it a lot easier to do those things that

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,950
make your blog's more accessible for

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,260
search engines so things like title tags

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:36,110
and descriptions and things like having

00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,640
a sitemap all of those things are a lot

00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,370
easier with a plug-in like this so I

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,900
definitely recommend doing that

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,390
so essentially you can create fewer

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,010
blogs at higher impact we can kind of

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,230
stop spinning our wheels and churning

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:50,210
out content that doesn't perform because

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,400
what I've seen so many times is people

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,929
just like ah man we need to do five more

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,879
blog posts for this client this month

00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:57,440
how what do we do this

00:26:55,879 --> 00:27:00,169
sounds like a fun topic idea and we just

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,029
spin our wheels and we keep like just

00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:03,499
churning out this content based on ideas

00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:05,659
that we had and maybe some of them will

00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:07,039
stick but it's because we didn't

00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,259
research and because we didn't actually

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,479
look into what our clients actual

00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:13,429
customers want to read and want to know

00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:15,379
about a lot of them won't end up

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,869
performing because it doesn't hit the

00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:20,149
mark for the audience so the second kind

00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,609
of pillar here is you oversell or you

00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:24,559
under sell on your blog so if you

00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,809
picture like a pendulum on one end you

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,359
have the people that say well if if they

00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:30,679
learn from us they'll buy from us and I

00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,989
don't know if you've seen any of these

00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,459
blogs but it's been pretty prominent in

00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:36,799
the industry lately where a lot of these

00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:38,839
like consumer brands like Home Depot or

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,159
like Casper mattress like they have

00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:42,379
stirred they have launched their own

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,749
blogs and their blogs are essentially

00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:46,729
they barely talk about the business at

00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:49,429
all they're just general interest pieces

00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:51,379
and they get a lot of traffic but guess

00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,749
what they all shut down because their

00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:55,279
total cost centers and not profit

00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:56,929
centers they're not making any money for

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,219
the business because they're just

00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:00,319
interesting and they're not actually

00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:01,940
doing any selling so that's one end of

00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,349
the pendulum and then the other end of

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,879
the pendulum you have these people that

00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,769
say well to get the sale you need to be

00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:08,359
a little pushy these are the blog's or

00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:11,209
you read them and they're like we have X

00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,949
years of experience and we buy now and

00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:14,869
click here and all of the stuff and

00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:16,519
we've all read those kind of blogs but

00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:18,379
that's a total turnoff right when the

00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,940
company's just bragging about themselves

00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:21,799
and when they're being really pushy

00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,409
that's the same reason we don't like

00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:28,759
used-car salesmen right it's sorry if

00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:32,690
anyone's a used car you could be a good

00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:34,699
used car salesman anyway on the other

00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:36,259
end of the pendulum you have those types

00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:38,719
of people and that's just that's not

00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:40,789
right either so like with most things

00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:42,889
there's a happy medium right I like to

00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:44,239
say that the sweet spot for blogging for

00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:46,159
your business should hit somewhere

00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:48,589
between writing for sales and writing

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,969
for enjoyment so you have this content

00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:51,529
that's really interesting and it's

00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:54,409
helpful and it's useful and people

00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:56,989
actually really enjoy reading it but it

00:28:54,409 --> 00:29:00,259
also is used as a vehicle to sell your

00:28:56,989 --> 00:29:02,329
product or your service I also like to

00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:04,759
talk about business logging in terms of

00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:07,309
bringing someone from problem aware to

00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,820
solution aware so the kind of dumb

00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:12,210
example that I

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:14,519
to use I don't know why but so a couple

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,799
of weeks ago my car was making this

00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,570
really like awful dinging noise as if

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,970
like someone's seatbelt wasn't plugged

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,860
in and no one's seatbelt what like we

00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,450
were all buckled and it wasn't driving

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,250
me nuts like why is this happening every

00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,230
time I get in my car the seatbelt is

00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,240
ding-ding-ding for good minute or two

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,100
and then it would stop and like uh so I

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,590
have this problem I was aware of a

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,659
problem and so what you do when you have

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,980
a problem a lot of times is google it so

00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,899
I googled that like why the heck is my

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,389
Massa making this dinging noise like

00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:43,889
what is going on so although this didn't

00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:45,029
the next part did not happen to me I'm

00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:48,090
gonna use this for the sake of example

00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:50,009
so say I found like a local mechanic and

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,809
they blogged about like this dinging

00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:54,419
problem that can happen in your car and

00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:56,279
cool because they wrote a relevant blog

00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,330
that people are actually you know that

00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,639
address is a problem that people

00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,379
actually had I found it cool I found it

00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:03,149
in search engines and now I'm reading

00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:05,250
about it and as I'm reading I'm becoming

00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:06,299
aware that there's a solution to my

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,070
problem how cool

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,470
now I know that there's a solution to my

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,840
problem and I'm learning more about how

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,399
to fix it that's awesome but you can't

00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,960
stop there if you're a business who's

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,940
blogging you can't stop there because

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,440
someone's going to be like cool now I

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,039
know that there's a solution to my

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,700
problem

00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:25,830
by then not even buy from the business

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,929
so what what the mechanics should do in

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,259
this situation is say here's a solution

00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:33,899
to your problem this is a common thing

00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:36,929
also we can help also we've seen this a

00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:38,370
lot before also contact us here's an

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:40,049
easy way to contact us and bring your

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:42,029
car in we'll be happy to take a look at

00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:45,179
it boom that's how you bring someone

00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:47,879
from aware of their problem to ready for

00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,529
your solution another way to visualize

00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:52,230
this is just with the sales funnel right

00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:54,509
so if you think of that pendulum this is

00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,009
like what it looks like to only focus on

00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:57,870
selling selling selling you're only

00:30:56,009 --> 00:31:00,179
focusing on the bottom of your funnel

00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,830
but I always like to say that if you

00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,500
only focus on the bottom of your funnel

00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,080
if you're only focusing on buy from me

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,759
buy from me and you're not actually

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,559
informing your audience it's like asking

00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,529
someone to marry you on a first date

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,960
that's like I don't know you yet I'm

00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:17,399
doing my research still okay but then

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,379
you have those people who are only

00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:22,029
focused on the awareness stage and they

00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,799
never actually use the awareness and

00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:25,929
all that interesting content they have

00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,460
on their blog to actually drive people

00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:28,749
to actually make a purchase from them

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,399
whether that's you know you're an

00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:31,960
e-commerce store and you're trying to

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,299
get people to purchase on your website

00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,679
or you are a service based business and

00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:37,419
you're trying to get people to fill out

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,979
your contact form or call you or you

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,899
know you know do the chat bot or

00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:42,759
whatever you have on your site so you're

00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,499
trying to get people from awareness to

00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:47,349
conversion think about it in terms of

00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:49,330
the whole sales funnel so if you inform

00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:51,580
on the problem and you inform on your

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:54,070
solution as well you have the recipe for

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,049
business log success now the last kind

00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,580
of point if is the shortest but I think

00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,710
it's really important because I think a

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,659
lot of business blog content is siloed I

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,849
think it's it's pretty fragmented and

00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:05,259
it's not really attached to any larger

00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:06,429
business goals you kind of have blogging

00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:08,830
over here and then you have business

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:10,210
goals and they don't really connect so I

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,580
think we need to be thinking of blogging

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,159
a little bit more holistically and when

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,960
I don't understand something I try to

00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:18,639
make a visualization because that tends

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,909
to help me so hopefully it helps you all

00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:23,710
as well it took me a really long time to

00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:25,299
to understand this like I said in the

00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,559
beginning when I first started when I

00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:28,539
was right out of college I was just

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,089
happy to be getting paid I did not

00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:33,190
understand how my blogging actually

00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:35,080
contributed to my clients bottom line

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,729
I'm blogging but what is that actually

00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,179
doing for the business so hopefully this

00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:42,159
helps number one businesses need to

00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:43,479
write content with the goal of ranking

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,859
in search engines because that's how

00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:46,899
people are going to find you it's one

00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:48,639
way a really good way that you can

00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:50,830
connect with your potential customers

00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:52,330
but I think a lot of businesses at least

00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,909
a lot of the ones that I've worked with

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,190
they tend to want to stop there they say

00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,719
get me ranking on page one and that's

00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,729
all I care about and then they stop and

00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:02,619
celebrate when they hit page one and

00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:04,749
it's like cool but like your customers

00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:07,690
are way over here you have not your only

00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:09,129
ranking you there's a long way to go so

00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,289
after you're ranking you need to

00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:12,729
actually get that traffic think about

00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,099
the fact that you're on page one you're

00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:18,279
sharing page one with nine sometimes

00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:19,809
more other URLs what is gonna make yours

00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,169
stand out you still have to win that

00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:24,969
traffic right so let's assume that you

00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:27,969
did win the traffic cool I'm ranking on

00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:30,129
page one with my blog posts and I won

00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:32,619
the click now I got the traffic now you

00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:35,410
actually have to convince those visitors

00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:38,050
to convert you have to actually convince

00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,370
to contact you so we can't just that's

00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,780
why we can't just write four machines

00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,000
right we can't just write four SEO

00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,130
because when we do you've all heard or

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,080
read that SEO content that's not

00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,120
pleasant to read because someone just

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,310
stuffed it with key words and it's kind

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,870
of short and it's not very it's just not

00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:55,350
interesting it doesn't hit on what you

00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:57,970
need as a consumer to be ready for

00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,070
making a purchase so our content also

00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,530
has to be compelling and it has to turn

00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:04,870
those website visitors into potential

00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:06,820
customers who are so interested in your

00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,740
content and they're so glad to have read

00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,800
what you had to say that they are

00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,780
willing now to sign up and fill out a

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,149
contact form and become your customers

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,919
and then once someone submits a lead

00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:19,419
form and this is assuming that you're

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,460
not an e-commerce site and the purchase

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:23,950
is done at that point but let's assume

00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,240
then that people have contacted you and

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,429
they filled out a contact form and

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,960
called you or whatever people are now

00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,270
you have the chance to actually make

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,520
those leads your customers so what

00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,590
started as a blog ranking way over there

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,450
has now made its way all the way to a

00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,370
customer so I just think it's important

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,320
to not forget what blogging is for we

00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:43,120
tend to think of blogging over there

00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,590
I want to rank I want to rank but we

00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,000
forget the fact that we're trying to

00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,090
we're trying to actually get the

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,100
business some customers so to kind of

00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,169
wrap it up businesses blog for three

00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,780
main things in this universe so

00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:57,310
businesses blog to rank for relevant

00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,770
keywords we want to make sure that our

00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,630
business blogs are actually getting

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,510
surfaced in search engines that people

00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,730
can find them we also want those

00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,500
business logs to engage the reader we

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,890
want them to be interesting enough to be

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:14,440
compelling and persuasive and we also

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,960
want those business logs to convert they

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,760
need to convert readers into customers

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,340
in order for you to make a positive

00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,910
impact on your clients bottom line and

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:26,360
have a positive ROI from blogging Thanks

00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:32,500
I thought I had

00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:35,510
[Applause]

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,590
and I don't know if there is time for

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,480
questions yeah sure

00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:59,150
until someone tells me no I'll take rice

00:35:38,480 --> 00:36:00,710
to him oh yeah yeah yeah I think that's

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,660
a really important point that you

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,220
brought up I think that's totally true I

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,220
think if you are blogging you don't

00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,350
always have to blog directly about okay

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,910
I I do this so I can only blog about

00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:13,040
like if you're a dentist for example I

00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,930
can only blog about like dental implants

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,610
like no one wants to blog only about

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,290
tunnel and flip so finding those

00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:20,080
interesting things or there's areas of

00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,280
overlap with something more interesting

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,050
definitely try to latch on to those

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,270
things that are maybe areas of overlap

00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,890
that are that make you more interesting

00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,480
but it's still relevant to what you do

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,840
in some way yeah that's a great point

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,840
yeah

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:49,420
you're not necessarily going to say yeah

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,339
I think it just depends on your goal for

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,470
your website so if your goal like I said

00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:55,690
in the beginning is to maybe monetize

00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,819
some of your traffic and sell like you

00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,020
know add spacers you affiliate links or

00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:01,000
something like that then just raw

00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,980
traffic is a fine goal because we're out

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,230
traffic is what's gonna get you money

00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,270
right but if you're talking about using

00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,880
your blog to actually get business you

00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:12,010
want people even if it means less less

00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,569
traffic if it gets you more conversions

00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,549
and gets you more customers that's what

00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:16,990
you want so you want more customers if

00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:19,930
you're kind of operating on that model

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:21,520
so more traffic isn't bad it just more

00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,650
traffic doesn't always equal more

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,240
customers so if you blog about the more

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,700
relevant things you blog about the

00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,440
greater your chances of getting really

00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,760
qualified leads and actual customers

00:37:29,440 --> 00:38:05,299
rather than just generally interested

00:37:30,760 --> 00:38:14,999
people yeah cool yeah right

00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:17,039
yeah yeah like to reengage and get more

00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:20,219
loyalty back from those people that were

00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:22,410
customers I think um while organic is a

00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:25,049
totally fine option maybe that person

00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,940
has another question and then they find

00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:28,259
you through you know doing a google

00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,910
search link oh oh yeah I've used them

00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:32,009
before so you can still that's still

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,329
relevant but it's not as targeted it's

00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,190
not as if you can say to Google like

00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:36,839
okay only show my blog to people who

00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,339
used to be customers and that's more

00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,779
like ad targeting and what what you're

00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:41,640
talking about so I think what you can do

00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:43,799
with that is you could even you know

00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,269
send an email to those people if you

00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:47,400
know that you do some type of email

00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:49,079
marketing and you can say like you know

00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,940
hey just reminder like here's a discount

00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,400
coupon or something that kind of coaxes

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,989
them back in to be reengaged with you or

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,519
something like that so maybe email and

00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:58,109
something something more targeted than

00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,239
inbound would probably be good if you're

00:38:58,109 --> 00:39:04,349
specifically setting out to reengage

00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:05,509
past customers yeah cool that's a really

00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:09,180
good question

00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:11,819
cool okay I think that's it but yeah

00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,130
feel free to again tweet at me or tweet

00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:16,769
at me sounds aggressive you guys you can

00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:20,459
just talk to me after I'll be around for

00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:23,309
a little bit yeah oh my website my

00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:26,309
website is soapbox ly calm and I don't

00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:27,719
have that on here but I will I will

00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:30,180
definitely post it if you go to my

00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,949
Twitter profile I have it linked there

00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,229
as well so that that's my Twitter handle

00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:35,849
and you can go to that and you can see

00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:37,289
my Twitter profile page and I'll have a

00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:39,209
lot of like I'll have the link to the

00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:41,099
deck you guys didn't see the deck up

00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:42,569
there if you want it and I'll have a

00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,069
link to my website and things like that

00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:46,759
so I'll try to make all of that

00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:46,759
available yeah

00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,640
I use google analytics I think Google

00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,500
Analytics it just depends kind of yeah

00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,210
what you want to evaluate for sure so if

00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm doing a blog content on it and I

00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:03,050
want to see how people are engaging with

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,330
all of the content then Google Analytics

00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,160
is perfect because that's in a way to

00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,590
see engagement but if you're trying to

00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,690
see something like how many how many

00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,040
links have I earned on that's getting a

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,720
little bit more technical but there are

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,310
other platforms that can show you that I

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,680
mean Google Analytics you can see

00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,120
referral traffic and that's kind of a

00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,730
roundabout way of viewing that but there

00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,470
are some platforms that are easier ways

00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,910
excuse me to see to see what you want to

00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,080
see but Google Analytics yeah is what I

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:42,950
was referring to when it comes to like

00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:44,090
page views yeah yeah no that's a great

00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,200
question there's a lot of different

00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,820
tools that do a lot of different things

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,830
so it kind of gets confusing to keep

00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,630
them all straight for sure Yoast is you

00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,660
know a plug-in within WordPress to help

00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,980
you help you optimize your post which is

00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,080
another jargony word that just

00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,550
essentially means make sure it's really

00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,320
accessible and findable for search

00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,510
engines so it's gonna kind of guide you

00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,610
to do things like here's where you put

00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:06,110
in your title tag and it helps you do

00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,660
all those sorts of things whereas Google

00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:11,030
Analytics is more of like a not how to

00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,310
create your page but how to see how your

00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:15,140
page is doing yeah that's more

00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,770
performance and reporting rather than

00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:24,380
Yoast as helping you do the work yeah

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:26,060
yeah oh sorry yeah I kind of bypassed

00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,260
over that there were like two things is

00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,170
that what you're talking about yeah so I

00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,850
personally used Yoast or a uzo so the

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,710
other one is called all in one SEO pack

00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,180
and I've heard that's good from a lot of

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:37,370
people I don't personally use it so I

00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,590
can't like advocate it for it one way or

00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:41,090
another but I like Yoast so I would

00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,350
check that out I can recommend that one

00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,560
personally but the other one yeah is all

00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:49,490
in one mm-hmm

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:52,910
cool I don't know like what time but or

00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:55,280
who's yeah tomber MS okay cool yeah if

00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:58,840
anyone has any other questions I'm

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,410
available stuff yeah sure go ahead

00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,029
[Music]

00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:06,099
yeah that is I look I should do a whole

00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:08,410
presentation just on I really like going

00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:10,000
in Google Analytics and do you use

00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,309
Google Analytics yeah is that what you

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,599
so usually it just depends on what I'm

00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:15,910
looking for so if I'm looking for

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,650
something like pure like popularity like

00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,779
we were talking about here how is it

00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,670
performing in search engines what I

00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:24,190
would do is try to go to that report

00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,690
that shows me all of my channels and I

00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,460
would want to see the source medium I

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:29,890
would want to see what traffic is coming

00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,839
from Google organic specifically and so

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,569
I'd look at probably page views from

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,099
Google organic so that would be a metric

00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:37,869
I would look at if I wanted to just see

00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:40,119
how it was performing in search engines

00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:42,880
but if I wanted to see things like you

00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:45,609
know how how are people engaging with my

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,559
site and like are people using this to

00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:48,970
view other pages on my site then I would

00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:52,539
look at things like bounce rate and an

00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,710
average and you know pages or pages per

00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:54,910
session and things like that so it

00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,069
really just depends what you're looking

00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:59,470
at but yeah there's so much data it's

00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:01,539
like what do I do with all of this but I

00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,859
think if you can isolate a goal and what

00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:05,079
you're trying to see and what you're

00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:06,910
trying to evaluate then it's a lot

00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:07,960
easier to kind of navigate analytics

00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:10,270
because you're only looking for one

00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,220
thing and not like all of the things and

00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:14,440
all of the metrics yeah I don't know if

00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,880
you've used analytics now I don't know

00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,410
if it's still in beta but it has that

00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,079
cool like you can actually just type a

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,599
question into it and it'll jump you to

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,559
the report so if you yeah type it in

00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,240
there because they know it's

00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,400
overwhelming that's why they put it in

00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,289
there this is too much so if you just

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,180
Google or Google if you just put it in

00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:33,609
the analytics search box up there and

00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:35,319
you say like hey can I how many sessions

00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:37,359
did I get last month it'll jump you to

00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:39,339
their report instead of having to like

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,500
go through the navigation and through

00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:43,210
all the data to find it so I don't know

00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,770
if it's still in beta I I have it on at

00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,430
least the properties I look at so maybe

00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,809
check that out be helpful it's not cool

00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,309
cool that's good to know so it's

00:43:49,809 --> 00:43:53,260
definitely helpful I'll use that it's a

00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:57,089
little search bar jumps you to the right

00:43:53,260 --> 00:44:01,210
report that's awesome I love it cool oh

00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:05,279
yeah I'll talk to you later tree I saw

00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,279
your hand go up first no you're good

00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:19,670
yeah yeah definitely if you're a if

00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,650
you're a blogger or a marketer that's

00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,720
going to become like your biggest skill

00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,820
I would say is your ability to kind of

00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,290
put yourself in the shoes of multiple

00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,570
businesses so it's hard enough to like

00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,580
get to know your own customers right but

00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:33,140
then when you're a blogger or a marketer

00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,760
you really do have depending on how many

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,590
clients you have you have to really put

00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,840
yourself in the shoes of lots of

00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,690
different businesses so I have clients

00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,010
who are software companies and

00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,350
psychiatrists and all kinds of JIT and

00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:47,270
you really have to kind of step step

00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,130
into that role and that's how you create

00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,690
relevant content because we've all

00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,700
probably seen blogs that were written

00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,050
for you know different types of

00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,400
businesses where they go this is not

00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,540
written by someone who knows what

00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:06,980
they're talking about like the business

00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:14,540
owner did not write to him oh yeah yeah

00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:15,980
at the risk for sure yeah I I definitely

00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,630
out sort like as my company's growing

00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,160
for sure and I'm you know this is pretty

00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,510
recent but as my company's growing

00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,880
definitely I have some people that I

00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,530
used to work with at my agency who are

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,230
like kind of already pre vetted because

00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:28,820
I know them and who I'm using to help

00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,680
with writing that content but yeah it's

00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,330
definitely a risk because as someone

00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,770
who's managed those teams of writers who

00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,930
have had to write for all different

00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:38,060
kinds of companies that was the biggest

00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:40,310
struggle was people who it's not like

00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,530
writing well and being able to string a

00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:44,480
sentence together is honestly not the

00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,070
biggest battle the biggest battle is

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,810
making sure your content doesn't say

00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,040
something inaccurate about the business

00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,810
because we've had that a lot of times

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,340
where they say like you know hey here's

00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:54,920
a blog client they're like we don't do

00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,510
this like that's not right and so yeah

00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,160
they're getting blogs but man like

00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,300
that's that's tricky it's definitely

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,590
tricky you have to get to know the

00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:05,210
industry really well that you're writing

00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:06,500
for ya think yeah yes okay cool thank

00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,630

00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,350
[Applause]

00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:12,210

00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,630
