Title: Chris Aldrich: Micropub and WordPress: Custom Posting Applications
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	April 6, 2019, 3:30 pm Horseshoe Ranch Room, University Center, College of the Canyons — The W3C recommended Micropub specification (2017) allows developers to create custom posting applications for a wide variety of data targeting any content management system that supports the spec.
Chris Aldrich provides an overview of the available plugin and endpoint for WordPress and a variety of client applications like Quill, Teacup, OwnYourGram, OwnYour Swarm, Omnibear, that allow one to post status updates, bookmarks, likes, check-ins/location data, photos, and more directly to WordPress sites.
We’ll also talk about how developers can create custom posting interfaces to drastically simplify content creation and posting for clients in ways that can be even simpler than working with Gutenberg.

so except for Joseph does anybody

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,539
actually know what micro pub is or have

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:26,779
any clue other than okay we're gonna

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:29,490
have some fun then this shouldn't work

00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:31,679
so if you get a boffo Socko calm the

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,300
last post five minutes ago we'll have a

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,940
link to the slides that you can open up

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,460
it's got some clickable stuff and fun

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,190
things you can pull through so let's

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,710
start with twelve years ago how many

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,350
people were on early Twitter when there

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,539
were like 5,000 clients and you could

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,930
post a Twitter using almost anything on

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,680
the planet is anybody but go back that

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,379
far oh that's sad so that's this is why

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,329
we have a problem that we do today

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,739
so they used to have a nice open API

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,000
anybody could post a Twitter

00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,280
hundreds and hundreds of clients and

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,799
eventually they shut that all off and

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,930
now you use one of maybe ten clients to

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,890
post to Twitter and who owns all of

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:21,960
those clients can anybody guess Twitter

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:24,570
yeah of course so can anybody name for

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,700
me I think maybe there's like five or

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,700
six ways to post a WordPress right now

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:38,689
can anybody name some of them are your

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:41,579
favorites okay email is an option yeah

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:43,500
yeah there's phone apps for iOS and

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,799
Android and probably maybe even one

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:51,740
other how else obviously the admin UI

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,740
right or Gutenberg now is an option

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,390
OOP there's a Google Docs add-in that

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,759
you can post and that's actually new I

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,469
think in the last year and then there's

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,600
some old legacy X XML RPC clients like

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:09,539
Ulysses there are some standalone

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,280
clients that are built for particularly

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,530
blogging and blog posts that you can

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,570
create content in

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,210
hit publish and it will update your

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,730
website automatically so what I'm going

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,040
to talk about today is a new method of

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:27,840
doing this in a new way of doing this

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:32,550
that has a lot more power and

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,709
flexibility so I think we're about a

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,730
year and a half in this is a w3c

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:41,250
recommendation now it's been built it's

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,470
coated in probably half a dozen

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,260
different languages if not more it's

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,700
supported by several dozen clients and

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,680
several dozen servers these will be some

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,470
basic resources you can take a look at

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,390
this is the technical specification I

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,489
don't recommend anyone reads this unless

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,440
you're a developer and you really

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:07,050
desperately need to read it better

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,209
resources are indie web org there's a

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,930
list of clients that work and a list of

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:15,600
servers a lot of this stuff is super

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:20,220
duper open-source and a half a dozen

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,019
different programming languages so very

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,180
rarely would you need to go write

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,430
something for yourself from scratch you

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,709
can probably take code someone else's

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:33,269
written repurpose a lot of it to get

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:36,630
yourself pretty far so the nice part

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:39,660
about micro pub is it isn't WordPress

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:43,260
specific which things like Gutenberg or

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:47,579
word presses own admin UI are so

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,079
obviously you can't use yep I know

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,600
there's a project right now somebody is

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,030
working on adapting Gutenberg so you can

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,880
use it to post a drupal but otherwise

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,500
all those four or five options we

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,900
mentioned for posting to your WordPress

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,590
site only exists within the WordPress

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,200
ecosystem and nowhere else but micro pub

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,060
is built in such a way that you can post

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,120
to WordPress you can post a drupal

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,090
there's some CMS's like with known that

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,940
have an endpoint built into it to accept

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,530
data to post to it with any of these

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,090
types of apps there's also a handful of

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,560
static site generators that you can post

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,190
to as well

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,640
if you were a company like medium or

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,350
wicks or Squarespace my guess is you

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,280
could put two developers on it for two

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:44,010
or three days build a a server to accept

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,180
micro pub into your website and then all

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,740
of these clients were going to talk

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,480
about today would then be usable for

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,340
those platforms as well so this is the

00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,020
fun one that we're all here today and

00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:00,470
we're gonna chat about this particular

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:05,190
one it's a plugin in the main repository

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:09,240
about a year ago it was updated to the

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:13,290
most recent version of the micro pub w3c

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,140
spec it also has some extensions onto it

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,810
but even more fun it's now fully

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,320
integrated into the word presses and to

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,780
word presses REST API so you can go a

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,190
lot further a lot farther with it

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,800
prior to about July of last year it was

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:40,010
written in pure PHP so it was a little

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:40,010
harder to deal with in terms of standard

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,810
standard code for those who are using

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,300
Gutenberg you can either use that or the

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:56,700
classic editor it will work with both it

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:59,040
doesn't it's not integrated into

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,470
Gutenberg anyway so there aren't any

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,630
direct issues that anybody I know has

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:08,790
seen or experienced up to this point so

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,430
configuration if you're gonna create a

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,080
client that you can use or multiple

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,570
clients that we can use to post a word

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,580
press how much configuration do we think

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:21,870
is going to be required for a plug-in

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:27,000
like this anybody got any guests any

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,850
ideas oh wait there's nothing there oh

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,590
there's no configuration really so you

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,660
download the plug-in you install it you

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,150
activate it you're done and it should

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,880
just work

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,550
trademark right there

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,520
I think there's one small set is set up

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:48,480
in the settings in the writing admin

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,530
that will allow you to choose data for

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,970
posts coming into your website are they

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,710
published automatically are they drafts

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,570
or are they private I think that's the

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,370
one setting that actually exists but

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,980
other than that it's it's pretty

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,620
straightforward so if you're going to

00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,200
let some outside client post your

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,810
website the first thing you got to be

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,740
really worried about is authentication

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:18,210
and authorization is everybody used

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,520
either but probably the two more common

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,670
ones are Twitter and Facebook

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,050
both have oo auth two implementations

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:30,390
that you can let's say sign up to

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,430
Squarespace and to authenticate and

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,990
create a square Spacek or not

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,820
Squarespace a SoundCloud account that's

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,380
probably a better example so you want to

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,110
create a SoundCloud account you actually

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,850
log into Facebook Facebook does the

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,300
little oauth2 dance and then you end up

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,630
and oh now you have a new account on a

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,660
new social service how awesome would it

00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,120
be if we could do that but with

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,010
WordPress be pretty cool wouldn't it it

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,340
actually already exists somebody's built

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:02,480
it it's not only oo auth 2 compatible

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,930
but it includes a thing called indie off

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:10,260
that's an extension of aloft 2 so the

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,390
micro pub plug-in has this piece of

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,490
authentication and authorization built

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,940
into it but if you want there's a more

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,680
powerful version called indie off that's

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,140
in the plug-in a repository that'll do

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,150
this exact same thing and as we go

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,900
through I'll show you examples of what

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,820
this looks like so these are the if

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,390
you're a developer or coder these are

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:36,060
the types of scopes that these clients

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,490
will ask or could potentially ask your

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,190
website will you let me do these things

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,310
so create new posts update things delete

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,110
things undelete them or post media to

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,160
them so if you want to post photos or

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,839
let's say audio files to your media

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,649
portion of your WordPress site it'll be

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,100
able to do all of the

00:08:52,649 --> 00:09:03,470
things so the fun part is now here's a

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:07,740
handful of examples of micro pub clients

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:11,550
quill is probably one of the strongest

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:16,050
built and most flexible versions of this

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:18,629
and if you can imagine using it's fairly

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,420
similar to medium comms experience or

00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:24,389
now even the Gutenberg editor experience

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,709
where you can quickly type in and create

00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:29,490
little blocks but if you imagine

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:31,889
WordPress medium comms editor quill is

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,679
very similar to that so you can use an

00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:38,670
interface similar to that to post to

00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:42,439
your WordPress site the two next on that

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:45,809
list on your swarm and on your gram are

00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:48,449
implementations that will allow you to

00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:51,029
connect your swarm or Foursquare

00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:54,269
accounts or your Instagram account to

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,999
your WordPress site on a very regular

00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:01,470
basis I take photos with instagrams

00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:05,249
super over-engineered mobile app and I

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,100
post them to my Instagram account and on

00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:10,319
your gram watches that account and is

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,199
authorized to post to my site on its

00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:16,290
behalf so it will scrape out all of my

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:19,589
Instagram data and mirror it exactly on

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:23,069
my website date and time stamps GPS

00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:25,860
coordinates location data and names

00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:28,649
it'll take the title or a little post

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,929
that I put on all that data moves over

00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:32,759
to my website and then I also have a

00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:35,129
little piece that takes all the comments

00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,749
and likes and sucks those back into the

00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,749
comment section on that same piece of

00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:41,629
content so if Instagram were to just

00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:44,879
disappear off the planet tomorrow

00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:49,589
through the use of micro pub and its

00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:51,660
friend web mention I own all of my

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,519
Instagram data and I wouldn't miss a

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,009
beat I wouldn't care other than losing

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,769
the friends who were only stuck on an

00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:01,350
Instagram but those two work essentially

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,709
the same Omni bearer is a fun little

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,170
browser extension for chrome and firefox

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:10,840
that implements

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:16,820
micro pub and it allows you to posts

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:19,730
bookmarks likes replies and short status

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,800
updates or notes from your browser bar

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,750
so if you're on a webpage that you want

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,110
to share with someone you can bookmark

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,040
it save it to your website

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,120
instantaneously and share it out from

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,450
there

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,160
teacup is a fun little app that will

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,210
allow you to track what you're eating or

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,390
drinking and it literally the only data

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,740
it takes are the thing you're eating the

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,350
thing you're drinking the date and time

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,810
stamp and if you want the location you

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,180
can optionally send the location but

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,750
there is an implementation I think on an

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:58,550
iOS watch app that with about two clicks

00:11:53,750 --> 00:12:01,010
you can save that you know that cocktail

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,040
you're drinking right now to your

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,810
website and either you can keep it

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,860
public private whatever you want but you

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,710
can save that data almost

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,670
instantaneously and it's faster than

00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:15,830
posting to any to any other social media

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,250
website I think then anything I've seen

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:22,040
there's a micro pub client called

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,290
indie book club or indie book club biz

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,530
you can take things you're reading right

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:29,540
now use that service and it will post to

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,600
your website to say hey I'm reading this

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,880
book or this article this thing there's

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,760
another one that's fairly similar to

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,520
quill called micro publish net that will

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,450
let you do I think full-length articles

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,820
status updates bookmarks likes replies

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,470
and maybe one or two others there's

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,010
another one called screech if you're a

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:55,250
podcaster you can create a podcast in

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:58,340
this app and use screech to publish your

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:01,580
audio files to your website it's very

00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:04,700
slick these are probably I don't know

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:09,020
eight or so of maybe 20 clients that are

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,250
out there so here's an example well

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,020
we're going to kind of walk through it

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,380
quickly this is what quills interface

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:20,060
looks like you go to the website

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,550
I think it's quill dot p3k dot IO is

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:27,230
the domain name the link on here will

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:29,450
take you to it but you log in with your

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:33,530
domain name so in my case I type in

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:36,140
boffo Socko com I hit sign in and takes

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:39,620
me to the very common looking wordpress

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,570
login and says ask me do I want to give

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:46,210
it the ability to create posts update

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:48,440
posts or post media to my own website I

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,870
can pick and choose which ones I want

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,080
outlaw it and then I click authorize and

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,350
this is a very familiar Oh off to dance

00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,550
and it takes me immediately back to the

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,550
posting interface for this client

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:09,500
compared to WordPress's

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:14,870
admin UI as this clean dirty better

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:17,390
worse than what they've got I don't give

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:24,140
it my password at all it uses its I just

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:25,940
I just oauth2 into my website no you you

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,630
can't you can't go to this and type in

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:31,940
boffo Socko comm and I have to be logged

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,710
into my website for that to happen so if

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,510
I if I wasn't logged in I would have

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,390
gotten a login screen that logs me in

00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:41,390
and then it would have said hey you know

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:44,780
so it knows I'm logged in automatically

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,860
and and goes to the next step I I could

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,450
have sure I could have thrown that one

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:52,660
in there but essentially I just used

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,660
OAuth 2 to get into my website yeah

00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:01,110
essentially yeah it just takes it and

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,629
dumps it right in so this is the

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,730
interface for posting a status update or

00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:09,869
Twitter setup so you'll notice it's got

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:12,629
a tweet counter up here I can put in

00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:16,800
tags if I want I can put in a slug I can

00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:19,410
add a photo I have a few endpoints on my

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,439
website to let me send it to another

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,660
news service to Twitter or if I want to

00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:26,639
post it to github I could post it to

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,360
github and then there's a little

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,059
checkbox that says look up my location

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,579
and send my GP or GPS coordinates to my

00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:38,910
website as well so then we come down to

00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:42,540
the bottom and you hit post so instead

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:46,949
of being assaulted with the 57 meta

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:49,290
boxes in the classic editor or the crazy

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:51,660
business that Gutenberg now does for me

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:55,230
to create a quick status note on my own

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:59,129
website this is a pretty quick simple

00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,869
slick solution I hit publish and this is

00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:06,480
literally what it looks like on my own

00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:08,759
website so I've got the note here it's

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,410
taken the GPS coordinates my site knows

00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,959
what to do with that and gives me a full

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,029
address my site even goes out and looks

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,720
up what the weather was in that location

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:21,329
where I'm at and then it it shows I've

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,540
syndicated it to a wordpress.com address

00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:27,329
and to a Twitter account and if you

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,129
click on that Twitter bird it will take

00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:31,829
you to the copy that got sent to Twitter

00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:34,439
automatically so I literally logged into

00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:38,040
this client typed a few words

00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:41,569
a couple checkboxes hit publish it lives

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,540
live on my site it goes automatically to

00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:49,350
WordPress or to Twitter and then if

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:52,740
you're using some other indie web tools

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,749
like web mention if you go to my Twitter

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,019
account right now and click like or

00:16:54,749 --> 00:17:00,259
reply to this we can at the end of the

00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,519
talk I'll pull it up but any

00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,620
interactions that happen with this post

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,659
on Twitter I'll come back to this same

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:10,409
post on my website in the comments

00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:12,209
section and get displayed there so again

00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:14,639
here's another example if Twitter

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,239
disappears and gets bought out next week

00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:20,069
or shut down or something happens to it

00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:22,139
everything I've posted to it in the last

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,999
four or five years lives on my website

00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:27,419
with all the commentary and notes and

00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:29,429
interactions that went with it this is

00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,109
the bigger kind of quill interface once

00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:34,440
you look at it it gives you the ability

00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:37,619
to post full articles in a medium or

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:43,429
Gutenberg like way these are notes you

00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:45,299
can do events bookmarks likes reposts it

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,989
you may have to do some work with

00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:51,119
WordPress to make it support itineraries

00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:53,639
but it'll do likes email and I think

00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:57,509
that's GPS location if I have not

00:17:53,639 --> 00:18:00,629
mistaken so you can choose any of those

00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:03,119
options and they provide you with simple

00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:06,690
versions like this is the interface for

00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:10,320
an article so you put in a title type

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,729
your post if you want to go over here

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,309
there's a little click a button that you

00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:16,979
can add photos so you it's a full text

00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:19,950
editor essentially and then when you hit

00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:22,349
publish at the top it sends that data to

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,779
your website and because your website

00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:27,649
has this plugin that knows exactly what

00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:31,049
to do with all the data it's being fed

00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:34,229
you can post it to your website bang

00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:36,599
zoom you're done this is an example of a

00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:39,359
bookmark so you can throw a URL in there

00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:42,450
give it a name description tags if you

00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:45,299
want and with a little bit of setup you

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,820
can create syndication points to send

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,789
your data to other social services if

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,679
you want there's also for a few of these

00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:55,229
types there's a quick bookmarklet that

00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,570
you can drag to your browser bookmarklet

00:18:55,229 --> 00:19:00,330
bar so that when you're on a website you

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,369
can click bookmark it will automatically

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,859
fetch the URL put it in there

00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:08,549
automatically in fact on my website I

00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:10,440
think I'm using there's a tool called

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:13,320
press this that just got taken out a

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,649
core in the last year that was used to

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,389
make bookmarklet posting to WordPress

00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,880
easy they took it out of core and it's

00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:23,450
now a plugin

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,900
but if I use this tool and a bookmarklet

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,150
it will pull the URL in send it to my

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:34,970
website my website will then go parse

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:39,200
that page and I think it uses micro

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:42,559
formats first scheme a json-ld and as a

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,799
super fallback it will use oh gee meta

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,440
tags to scrape that page to pull out the

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,480
title the description of the page in a

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,390
featured post so if you go to look at

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,659
bookmarks on my website after I hit

00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,450
publish my website literally just takes

00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:01,309
the URL and it sucks in all the rest of

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,490
the data to create a post on my site to

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:08,799
say head bookmarked something but it's

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:12,350
super slick and super quick and easy in

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,169
fact here's one for this is probably the

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:19,460
easiest interface if there's a tweet

00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:22,309
that I want to like I can put a favorite

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,260
bookmarklet in my browser bar click on

00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,539
it while I'm on that tweet it'll suck

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,110
the you a permalink for that your tweet

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:33,350
URL send it to my website to post it as

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,690
a like and it will also automatically in

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,640
this case this has a back end with

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,360
Twitter's API that it'll automatically

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,549
like that tweet on my behalf in a quick

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,169
easy way but if you want to like

00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:46,909
something online and you want to own the

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:48,260
fact that you liked that so you can

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:52,419
remember it and have it on your own

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:57,409
website off now in the future sometime

00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:59,330
the this one one field not fifty fields

00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:04,610
on your website that you need to fill in

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:07,280
or worry about here's a here's an

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:10,130
example of tea cup so it gives you

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,980
recent things a few default drinks

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:16,340
coffee beer cocktails food burritos

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,799
burgers a checkbox for the location and

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,750
then you can't see it's cut off but

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,120
there's a little post button at the

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,280
bottom which is what makes this UI

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:31,720
really simple enough to do from an apple

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,720
watch oh wait there's more

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:39,950
to me one of the reasons we all are

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:42,500
addicted to Twitter and Facebook we

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:47,090
don't if we think about it in this

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,160
perspective WordPress is 99% posting

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,710
interface so when you go to WordPress

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,090
and you're gonna create content it's all

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,700
posting interface and then you hit

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,400
publish and it's there but nowhere on

00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,870
your website is there a feed reader for

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,180
you to see and read other people's

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,750
content whereas when you look at Twitter

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:07,700
and Facebook it's 99% reading interface

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,580
and only maybe one or two percent

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,880
posting interface and that's what and

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,170
they make it super easy for you to post

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,640
well you don't need to worry about that

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,370
with WordPress anymore because now with

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,160
micro pub it's way easier to post almost

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:25,070
any type of content to your website but

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,680
what if there were feed readers that you

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:30,080
could read and while you're in the

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:35,080
reader you could type a reply to

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:38,990
something and hit publish with micro pub

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:42,500
it's using this API back-end that works

00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:45,110
with all these other CMS's not even just

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,140
WordPress but you can write a reply and

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:50,300
hit publish that reply goes to your

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:55,670
website and lives there so you always

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:59,750
have a copy of it and if you add the web

00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:01,700
mention plug-in you can send it it's

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,310
essentially a new web mentions a new

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,620
version of trackback or pingback but on

00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,970
acid and it makes things look the way

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,540
you would expect them to look in a

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:15,440
traditional comment section so I can in

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:17,780
a reader type a reply hit publish it

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,510
goes on my website my website sends a

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,520
ping to the thing I'm replying to to say

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,580
hey I mentioned you over there and then

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,290
the other side that gets to decide do I

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,470
want to display that on my side as a

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,450
comment or not but it creates a

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:36,820
full-circle posting and reading

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:42,200
interface within now a wordpress

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:44,930
specific set up there in the micro sub

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,380
world micro sub is another spec that

00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:49,260
essentially takes a fee

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,810
reader and splits it into it creates the

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,390
heavy infrastructure of pulling for

00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:56,940
feeds and it creates a separate

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,610
structure for how those are displayed so

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,700
you can build a server and build a

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,110
reader client interface and those two

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,000
are totally separate things

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,760
so if you're trying to build a new feed

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,160
reader and you're a UI person you don't

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,350
need to know all the feed reading specs

00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,190
to be able to do that you can rely on a

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:19,710
client to do that heavy lifting for you

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,720
but it also means there now are micro

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,700
pub clients like indigenous that I'll

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,650
not only work as a simple feed reader

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,650
but if you want to post a note or an

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:30,450
article to your website from it it'll do

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,690
that as well so it's not only a reader

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,190
but it's a posting interface and

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,750
somebody is in the midst I give them

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:40,140
maybe six months and there is a

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:42,720
wordpress-based micro sub server that

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,110
you can subscribe to all of your feeds

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,870
on your own website read them there and

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,790
suddenly your WordPress site is not just

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:55,170
a posting interface but it's now a

00:24:50,790 --> 00:25:00,690
reading interface as well hello Steve

00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:02,520
Jobs so what's the fun of this obviously

00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,930
it's pretty easy to use if you're a

00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,640
beginner you can download the plug-in

00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,440
start using some of these clients now

00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,600
it's easy to log into them and

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,900
authenticate and start using them but if

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:17,850
you're a developer there is a micro pop

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:20,190
rocks test suite so if you're building a

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,800
client or a server there's all kinds of

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,480
stuff you can test it against in

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,970
addition to a lot of open source code

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,490
that's been written already obviously

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:32,130
there's some huge network effects if you

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,040
can write a posting interface that not

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:39,210
only works just with WordPress but could

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:42,630
work with Drupal and Joomla and every

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,650
other CMS on the planet there's more

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,480
incentive

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,250
you could run something like that as a

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,290
business which is what a lot of Twitter

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,170
developers originally started out doing

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,940
was they were building these really

00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,220
lovely interfaces to interact with

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,250
Twitter until Twitter pulled the rug out

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,770
from underneath them micro pub is

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,530
completely open so

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:06,020
it's a w3c spec so you could very easily

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:10,120
build a business for creating client

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:13,640
interfaces for this type of stuff and

00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,190
obviously because it is leveraging oo

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,240
auth - there's a lot more privacy and

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,860
security versus some of the old I you

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,560
know you got to be really old to know

00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:30,140
what meta weblog was or Adam pub even

00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:33,200
back in the day so there's a handful of

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,750
experimental extensions on micro pub

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,940
that exist already so things like

00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,120
visibility is the post you send to your

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,890
website public or private WordPress the

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,340
WordPress implementation already does

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:53,960
this so you get to choose it'll also do

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:56,300
location visibility you can pull in data

00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,270
from your WordPress website into a micro

00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:02,090
pub client which is a fun thing for

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:04,520
editing posts and that's one of the fun

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,200
features of micro pub I haven't seen

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,600
anybody built it yet I've heard rumors

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,260
there are one or two working on it but

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:15,860
if you have micro pub servers that work

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:19,070
for Drupal and WordPress you can use

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,620
this query feature to pull data let's

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:24,200
say from the horrible Drupal site you

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,720
don't enjoy anymore pull all that data

00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,180
out of your Drupal site into a

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,820
third-party client and then you can hit

00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,340
publish to your brand-new WordPress

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,280
install and suddenly you now have a

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:41,560
one-to-one import/export that is

00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:44,720
seamless between two massive CMS's and

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,920
probably imagine sometime in the next

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,380
two years somebody's going to finish

00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,070
building this infrastructure so that you

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:54,410
can move from one CMS to another almost

00:27:51,070 --> 00:28:01,430
instantaneously in in a standards-based

00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:04,070
way so why is all this fun other than

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:08,330
you now have all these new clients that

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:10,850
you can post your website with part of

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,470
it is a plurality you can because it's

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,240
an open spec and it works on the web

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,070
anywhere you can code it

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,190
in any language you want you could come

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,900
up with a totally JavaScript you know

00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:25,130
definition of this you can write it in

00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:28,130
PHP rust Perl whatever language you want

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,929
to write it in and my guess is most of

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,850
the major languages are out there

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:35,929
somebody has written an implementation

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:37,490
in that language already so in the

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,850
open-source world you don't even need to

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,850
do it yourself

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,290
but my favorite thing is better UI so

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,720
one of the things I loved about all the

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:51,080
competition and Twitter clients when you

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,190
could do that was most of the Twitter

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,100
clients that we're out there were

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,860
actually nicer publishing interfaces to

00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,350
post to Twitter than Twitter Twitter's

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,280
own service itself somebody had an early

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:05,840
web UI for how posts to Twitter worked

00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,790
earlier today and it was just the

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,330
ugliest thing ever and it's really not

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:14,710
that pretty now but it opens up to a lot

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:18,170
more innovation so the nice part is

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:21,500
let's say tomorrow medium.com pivoted

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:23,870
for the sixth-seventh time they could

00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,620
take what has been called the billion

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:29,420
dollar typewriter and support micro pub

00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:33,080
and you could use their lovely fancy

00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:35,660
interface authenticate to your WordPress

00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,970
website create your content in medium

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,120
and then when you hit publish instead of

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:43,220
it publishing to a medium URL or maybe

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,710
it does that too but it also sends all

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,390
that data to your WordPress site and so

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,280
suddenly now you can leverage that

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,190
pretty posting interface and maybe

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,040
medium charges five bucks a month for

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,350
that I I would actually pay for that

00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,350
over five bucks a month for content that

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:04,309
they might want to feed me but the nice

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:07,450
part is it micro pubs already supported

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:10,700
in a half-a-dozen CMS's so it becomes an

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,890
actual business opportunity because you

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:18,650
can use it to publish everywhere and not

00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:22,100
just on WordPress so custom interfaces

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:25,550
how many agency people are developers we

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,850
have to have clients who are Exim and

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:30,290
annoying to them

00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:33,440
for the camera I'll say everybody in the

00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:36,200
room raised their hand the nice part

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,160
about this is you don't have to train

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,410
your clientele as much you don't have to

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:45,500
show them what all these meta boxes or

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,360
how Gutenberg works you can say here's

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,090
where the title goes here's where the

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,700
body goes here's how you add a photo hit

00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:55,460
publish you're done it's very simple

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,730
there's nothing additional above and

00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:02,930
beyond that I mentioned the

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:06,290
import-export piece earlier so we can

00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:12,410
wrap up with this what if Gutenberg

00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:14,510
itself were a micro client somebody I'm

00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,160
imagine within the next year is going to

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:19,000
take the finished version of what

00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,420
Gutenberg is and you can log into a

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,130
wordpress.com or wordpress.org site

00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,310
compose everything in Gutenberg and hit

00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:31,300
publish and maybe not necessarily

00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:35,090
publish it to your WordPress site but

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:37,820
let's say maybe Squarespace opens up a

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:43,310
little and adds an endpoint you can add

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:45,320
it there so if you have I'll be around

00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,600
if you have additional questions but

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,000
there's a bunch of resources at indie

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:56,690
web org there is a 24/7 live chat where

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,430
there are an inordinately this in

00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,470
multiple languages or for multiple

00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,790
platforms if you have questions and you

00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:06,590
want to build something yourself

00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:08,990
they are super helpful and even if

00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:11,480
somebody can't help you at 3:00 a.m. in

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,650
the in in the US time there's somebody

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,360
in Europe who's awake

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,250
who's done this who probably can help

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,380
you out they have both a general chat

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,540
and a developer channel depending on

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:26,090
what level you want to get this up and

00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:30,490
working with and that's all we've got so

00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:43,640
questions comments snide remarks

00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:47,270
yeah that's because your your typing

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,010
raw words in here to compose it and when

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:53,500
you publish it to your website your

00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:57,020
websites taking it as standard paragraph

00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,940
setups and your your websites doing the

00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:02,000
theming for that so your website has the

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:05,330
CSS to take those pieces now if you want

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,159
to do other custom setup like that you

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,640
easily could do that and send that data

00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,500
along as well I'm not aware offhand of

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,299
any clients that have done that for

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,500
doing like uber custom level inline CSS

00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:22,460
although I imagine you could probably

00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:25,360
type raw HTML into that quill editor to

00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:28,520
get inline Styles if you wanted to I

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,760
haven't tried it personally but it's it

00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:36,049
said it's generally sending raw HTML as

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,490
a push and pull requests or get requests

00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:44,240
and doing it that way

00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:46,669
so yes so with GDP our style step where

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,350
people will one day decide they want to

00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:50,299
delete their Twitter account and let's

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,980
say you and I have had Twitter

00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:55,600
conversations that end up on your

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:58,159
website what happens what happens when

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,140
you know obviously I delete my Twitter

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,000
that won't affect your personal website

00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,880
but as the website owner are you

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,770
accountable for the fact that I

00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,800
corresponded with you in the past does

00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:11,929
that create some surprise I could be if

00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,500
I were in Europe but I'm not in Europe

00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:17,990
in it and most of GDP are I think big

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,450
swaths of it don't apply to small

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:23,060
personal websites if now if I'm a major

00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:25,609
corporation yeah then I'm responsible

00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,530
and I if you at you see that data is

00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:29,359
there and ask for it to be removed I

00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:34,490
would be responsible for removing and I

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:39,889
think okay so there is that if your site

00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:44,379
is using the web mentions set up and you

00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:47,389
reply to my site directly

00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:51,200
web mention supports the ability to

00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:54,619
delete posts and send for tens so you

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,899
could send a delete and then re web

00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,579
mention my website and my website would

00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:08,450
respect that and automatically remove

00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:10,880
that comment so yeah that exists or at

00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,650
least would delete publicly from my site

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,900
I can stay I could still keep the data

00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:18,730
in the backend of my website but it

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:23,390
would unpublish it essentially so yeah

00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:36,769
they've thought of that yeah I don't

00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:40,670
know yeah there was a go back here

00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:44,420
there's a tags so what happens in this

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:46,400
case and I think in quill it's

00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,950
comma-separated and it creates a

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,069
discreet tag so what it does is it'll

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:57,289
send that data your WordPress site and

00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:59,660
the micro pub plug-in will check first

00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:03,049
to see does that already exist and if it

00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,759
does if it does is a category it'll put

00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:07,640
it in a category and then secondarily

00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:10,039
it'll create it'll put it as a tag if it

00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:14,839
doesn't exist it'll create a new tag for

00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:18,380
it as a default to my knowledge so it so

00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:20,119
it most of most of these clients use

00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,460
tags as a kind of general catch-all

00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:25,099
whereas WordPress separates categories

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:31,970
and then tags as two separate taxonomy

00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:35,089
levels but if I send it a category and a

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:37,279
tag in this field my website will know

00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:39,380
hey there's a category with that name so

00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:41,329
I'm going to use the category and then

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,390
the other one then becomes a tag so

00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:47,930
it'll it'll do that automatically and

00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:49,849
different different servers will have

00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,490
different implementations that so it may

00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,900
be drastically different in terms of how

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,200
that's implemented in Drupal because

00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:00,020
Drupal uses different taxonomy setups

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,480
so each each individual CMS can make

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,250
those decisions of what the end point

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,809
it's going to receive data and it's

00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,280
going to know what the data is going to

00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,049
be marked up in such a way that it'll

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,450
know what to do with those pieces of

00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:18,890
data or things like WordPress has fields

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,319
and it has meta places where you can

00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:24,319
store GPS coordinates but let's say you

00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:26,000
haven't set up anything on your site to

00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,369
show those GPS coordinates or do

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,589
anything with them so it won't display

00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:34,460
them but it'll save them in the meta for

00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:36,109
you four or five years later on so the

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,000
data will exist in your website and it

00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:39,559
will be in the database and then it's up

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,359
to you to decide what to do with that

00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:45,349
and how do you display it or not on my

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:48,190
thinking my example you know I show it

00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:50,329
is a little you know arrow icon and

00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,960
because I'm logged in you can actually

00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:55,220
see okay that I'm posting from my home

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,990
but if you're not logged into my website

00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,760
and you look at this you I don't think

00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,730
you'll see you won't see that location

00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,880
set up and you may you may not see the

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:08,299
weather either but it's it's up to you

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,339
as the website owner just to decide how

00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:14,869
do i display but most of the generic

00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:17,390
stuff things like photos articles that

00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:20,599
you may write or status updates are just

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:25,420
going into the the body is kind of bulk

00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:25,420
text yes

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:36,590
yeah and you can because of the way the

00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:39,830
indie off implementation is set up you

00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:42,950
can have a multi-user site so each user

00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:44,900
can log in with so typically what you'll

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:46,880
do in that case you won't use on my site

00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,520
its boffo Socko dot-com and it uses the

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,350
root domain but if you've got a multi

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,820
author site you would use the author

00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:58,460
slash author name URL that exists on a

00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,500
core functionality you'd use that URL

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,200
and log in with that and then it would

00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:06,230
authenticate and give that person a

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,230
bearer token for that client so each

00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:12,350
person in each account on a per account

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:21,530
or per user basis is then authenticated

00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:25,460
to post with whichever clients they it's

00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:27,020
not at the moment it's within the

00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:32,090
implementation and there are a handful

00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:36,170
of both filters and hooks that you can

00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:38,000
play around with when it except so the

00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,530
default I think is if you throw a photo

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,710
in there it's going to show up in the

00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,840
body of the text but you can play around

00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:47,750
with the data that's coming into your

00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:51,620
endpoint and say take the first photo

00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:58,040
and make that the the featured image so

00:39:51,620 --> 00:40:01,190
to speak so so now instead of the five

00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,290
we had in the early slide ways and my

00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,990
guess is almost none of you except for

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:11,290
maybe Joseph is posting by email and

00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:11,290
even then I bet you he probably he never

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,530
but my guess is most of you use maybe

00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,970
two methods at best to post to your site

00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:29,210
now you have about twenty that are quick

00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:30,650
and simple and easy and way less UI

00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:34,730
weigh less cruft

00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:36,590
than you did before personally and since

00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:40,810
we've got a few minutes I can pull it up

00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,810
I can get this guy to go away

00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:47,060
so I have this is the front page of my

00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:52,470
website so I have a handful of

00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:55,200
additional post types so in my mind post

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:58,980
formats didn't go far enough with their

00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,790
seven or eight so we can do a couple

00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:05,040
examples what's a what's a fun one

00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:07,500
here's a custom one so if I annotate and

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,880
highlight stuff on websites I use a tool

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:14,160
for it that tool then uses its uses a

00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:20,280
simple RSS feed but it will pull in the

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:23,070
URL I'm using the URL it goes and

00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,580
automatically scrapes the title the

00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:29,880
photo and the author link and name and

00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:34,800
then gives you the highlighted text that

00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:37,440
I found just for fun you can click on a

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,330
little you can click on a little link

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,100
and it'll take you to that page and

00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,530
scroll down so you can see here's the

00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,780
thing I actually annotated with the

00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:58,320
highlight of the thing that I physically

00:41:45,780 --> 00:42:00,420
annotated sure so blue is posts oranges

00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,150
comments and then this goes back five

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,280
years so you can tell when I started

00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,080
owning more of my data instead of

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,840
posting it just a Twitter or Facebook

00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:14,760
I started owning at all and a big chunk

00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:18,300
and have gotten you know all my social

00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:21,660
media comments I get more from Twitter

00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,540
and github so I can actually on my own

00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:27,060
website I can post issues to github I

00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:30,630
write it and compose it on my website I

00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:32,700
hit publish syndicate it to github it

00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,370
puts it onto github because github has

00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,730
an API for doing this and then if you

00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:40,980
reply to that github issue or queue or

00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,450
whatever it is I have a service that

00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,220
will scrape that data bring it back to

00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:49,590
my website and show you what that looks

00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:51,510
like so that gets pulled back in so if

00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,660
you have questions about how to own more

00:42:51,510 --> 00:43:00,660
of your data and so

00:42:52,660 --> 00:43:00,660
Media silos I have sure

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:13,720
Oh dramatically but I also now have way

00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:17,470
more internal cross-linking and linking

00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:20,680
out to other things so when I search for

00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:23,920
a lot of times when I search for names

00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,050
of friends that I know directly who have

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,330
commented either in social media areas

00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,840
or on my site if I do Google searches

00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:35,410
for them in their photos almost all of

00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:38,680
them come from my own website high up in

00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,630
Google Image searches because the SEO on

00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,420
my site is way better than it is on

00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:45,550
anything they're doing in social media

00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:50,490
so all their photos are from me in my

00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:50,490
site rather than from their impressions

00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:11,860
so I commented back to you on the it's

00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:17,770
purely safe yeah okay so which post for

00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:20,020
this one so here so here I when I logged

00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:23,380
in this morning I checked in on swarm

00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:25,210
and we can go to swarm and see this is

00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,790
what it looks like it's gonna make me

00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:29,530
log in to see it cuz it was private but

00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,450
here's the photos I took as I walked in

00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,930
this morning and checked in and that

00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:38,500
stuff automatically lives on my website

00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:40,570
I sent a tweet this morning but it came

00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,000
from my so I use WordPress essentially

00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:45,220
as my Twitter client of choice I post on

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,290
my site and actually I post in quill

00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,400
which posts to my site and then sends it

00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:50,400
to Twitter so

00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,790
yeah and whether you're using the nice

00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:00,130
part is if your designer developer and

00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:04,330
you want to create an application to

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,200
post to WordPress some custom it can be

00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:08,980
anything you want

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,480
you know food-related I'm waiting for

00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,490
somebody to do something exercise

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,730
related so you can take your Apple watch

00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:18,280
and say hey this is my you know hit one

00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:20,290
touch and here's my pulse rate right now

00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,300
after I'm exercising

00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:25,540
log it to my website but you can log it

00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:27,580
privately so that it's not public facing

00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:30,310
I three-quarters of the content of my

00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:34,120
website is on the back end and only I

00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:40,660
can see it so which one was it the

00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:43,120
testing this one so here's so so there's

00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,920
your comment shows up and it shows here

00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,200
too that it came from Twitter and if I

00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:53,110
want I can click on it and go see your

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:56,050
original and the threaded comment so the

00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:59,560
other nice part too and most people

00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:08,500
don't know this on my if I click reply

00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:12,160
there's actually a there's a custom URL

00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:15,310
that WordPress gives so if I reply to

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,210
you this is the URL I would send to

00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:21,700
Twitter and that allows then the

00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:24,520
conversation to be threaded both

00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:27,550
entirely on my site and entirely on

00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:31,960
Twitter so you have no idea ever

00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:33,820
in most senses that I'm replying from my

00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,060
website and that the entire conversation

00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:39,970
is mirrored on my site you choose to use

00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:59,590
Twitter and hey good on you that's your

00:46:39,970 --> 00:47:01,990
problem so when I within there's some

00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:05,260
settings in the web mention plug-in

00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:10,560
that'll allow me to to faith payal

00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:13,780
likes and replies for journalists and

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:19,000
bigger publications we've been working

00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:23,770
on one called reads so you what just

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,720
happened there so typically I'll put

00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:27,970
everything I don't always post them

00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,710
publicly but I log everything I read

00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:32,260
online if I read an article or a piece

00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:34,869
of a page I have a little bookmarklet

00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:38,290
that automatically takes the URL scrapes

00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:39,880
it gives me all of this data date and

00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,280
time stamps it and then if I want to add

00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,600
tags or categories and that way four

00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,859
months from now when you ask me a

00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,020
question oh I read this article

00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:49,390
somewhere I can actually look for it on

00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:51,850
my website find it here's your link you

00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:54,820
can read the same thing I read but this

00:47:51,850 --> 00:48:00,250
sends notifications to everybody who

00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:05,920
read those things so let's see if I can

00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:08,520
find a good one I think she sent me one

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,520
recently

00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:18,810
I think she accept accepts them so I

00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:22,110
read this post on Kimberly Hersh's

00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,790
website and somewhere down here she's

00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:25,800
she does I have the thing but it says

00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:28,260
reading and there are a couple

00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,050
indicators that a few people read this

00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:34,920
post which is a different semantic level

00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:37,200
of I liked it which on Twitter means how

00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,300
much nothing like it means I read the

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,000
headline okay great

00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,920
or and her case she's got a few mentions

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,930
so if you click on those it will take

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,510
you to webpages where people actually

00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:55,790
feature the clay mentioned this URL on

00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:59,940
her site and her thing so let's see a

00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:03,300
couple of them came from my website but

00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:05,250
she's not she's chosen not to do the

00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,100
full URL where those mentions came from

00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:10,380
she's hiding that data and so it only

00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,920
says that it's it's me this website

00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:16,080
mentioned her not but you know as you

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,140
saw two minutes ago when I search for I

00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:33,870
got to her page from the place where

00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:36,090
actually mentioned her yeah yeah so if

00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:38,730
there's abuse and you're getting spam

00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:43,560
from Twitter let's say you can hide all

00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:46,080
that stuff or because WordPress has both

00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,420
Akismet for spam or as well as other

00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,140
tools you can filter spam out but you

00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,180
can also choose to leave it in the

00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,890
moderation queue and not actually

00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,080
publish it on your website because you

00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:05,210
don't agree with maybe their politics

00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:05,210
maybe so yeah

00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,519
