please welcome bill wise bart playing

00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,279
with telephones Thank You Jo

00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,580
Thank You Jo appreciate it Joe's a great

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,740
guy and he's forever indebted to me

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,180
because I was the one who at our

00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,490
Pasadena meetups

00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,440
figured out how we could actually get

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,440
coffee that he could spill on himself

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,150
let's say a little bit about me very

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,920
very briefly I started out my career

00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,190
while someplace else and I came to

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,739
Southern California and ended up working

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,260
at the other Rockwell Canyon the one

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:51,760
which is in Thousand Oaks at the Science

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,409
Center for a number of years first as a

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,900
technical person then there's a program

00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:59,839
manager and then kind of phased that of

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,269
that took a little time off decided

00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:04,790
become a high school teacher this season

00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:07,070
I'm still regretting I retired from that

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,549
about a year or year and a half ago and

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,290
and found myself very lonely and went

00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:16,100
back to substituting a couple days a

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:19,700
week just because it's super fun and and

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,000
I got interested in websites a long time

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,410
ago but I got interested in WordPress

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,910
really when they started teaching high

00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,710
school I was teaching physics and

00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:32,860
chemistry and I realized that textbooks

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:37,360
had a lot of you know good information

00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:41,150
presented in a very pedantic and

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,760
difficult to understand manner because I

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,610
was reading the textbooks and I couldn't

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,410
really understand a lot of it either so

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,020
I started going onto YouTube which I

00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,600
found to be an amazing resource which

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,720
was just in its growing stages at that

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,790
time and I developed a website where I I

00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,800
just collected a lot of YouTube videos

00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,320
for the students to read and put in

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,470
questions for them and added some some

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,229
some thought-provoking ideas as an

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:12,650
adjunct material to my high school

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,319
lessons and I tried a couple of formats

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,450
and I I kind of stumbled across

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,040
WordPress and I was a little bit kind of

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,430
concerned about it because being a

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
technical guy I knew that if you're

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,800
using

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,470
something to build a website to build

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,530
anything other than direct coding that

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,120
will you're not a developer right then

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,810
Jason made a good point of that but

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,260
guess what WordPress is extremely

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,940
incredibly powerful and if you get

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,650
really frustrated you can get down into

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,240
the nuts and bolts of it which is what I

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,750
hope we do here today that's a lot about

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,750
me

00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:01,200
show of hands you have nice hands thank

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,750

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,960
anybody here heard of raise your hand if

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:12,960

great raise your raise your left hand

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:20,130
if you have not heard of yeah good okay

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,300
okay a couple of people have not heard

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:28,740
of chopping who raise your hand if you

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:31,680
have used child themes if you use child

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:37,200
themes raise your hand if you're afraid

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,270
of child themes okay raise your hand if

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,510
you have have coated your own child

00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:47,310
themes raise your hand if you've use a

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:50,040
plugin for it okay some people love the

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,090
plugins okay what I'd like to do today

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,980
is try to give you an idea of how well

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,580
that an idea but a real understanding of

00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,910
how Charles Eames really work what they

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,480
do

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:07,620
why should have them how to create them

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,570
from scratch and even if you end up

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,040
using a plug-in or not using them at all

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,730
at least they'll have an understanding

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,770
of of how they work and I'll be

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,130
displaying some code in here please do

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,750
not be too afraid there is some I don't

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,360
know if there's any HTML code but

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,600
there's some CSS code who here is use

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,640
CSS like like a lot of people and I'm

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,560
sure you all use it far better than I do

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,560
no question there okay

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:40,020
let me point out that this is

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,570
at the theme this addresses issues at

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,830
the theme level not at the page builder

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:49,320
level okay and I also am a great fan of

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,900
Elementor and I use element or an

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,270
element or pro on a regular basis and I

00:04:51,900 --> 00:05:00,570
think there are amazing tools okay so

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:05,009
what are child themes why do you need to

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:08,370
use child themes and when and how do you

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:11,220
build them and hopefully that's what

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,530
we'll go through today okay a child

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,990
theme is an add-on to an existing theme

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,789
so you have a theme there are default

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:22,099
automatic themes does everybody know

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:25,229
automatic no automatic is a company

00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:29,160
which which has had some great successes

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:31,560
it's the company that that actually has

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,870
developed and maintains the WordPress

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,789
platform and they have some default

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,280
themes the default themes are really

00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:40,380
excellent in my opinion because they are

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,789
extremely well developed code they're

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,490
very robust they're very error-free and

00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:49,500
and that's a good starting place now

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,139
I've used other themes as well okay but

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,570
I I generally tend to gravitate back to

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,449
automatic automatic does have some

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,250
essential problems there spelling is not

00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:04,770
very good they put an extra T in

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:08,280
automatic I think it's a a a a you t om

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:16,340
a TT there's two T's this to too many

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:16,340
T's T o t oo t okay

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,510
that when you have you always start with

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,920
a theme but now you want to do things to

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,940
that theme which may be a little bit

00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,550
special okay you want to modify the

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,520
theme and add some custom capability to

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,320
the theme itself okay

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,910
custom templates custom page templates

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,580
is the example I'm going to go through

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,090
here today and then the child theme

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,830
actually sits on top of the parent theme

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,800
and I had a little picture of a kid

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,930
sitting on guys shoulders but I didn't

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,730
fit it on the page but that's really

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,580
what it does you have your theme and

00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:01,640
then above that think of it you have

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:05,550
your child theme okay and it modifies

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,760
the theme itself now if I move on I

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,520
should move a little more quickly oh why

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,220
should use it oh you modify a theme

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,040
WordPress publishes an update you lose

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,210
all your custom code it's just gone away

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,010
you'll never see it again

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:25,560
boohoo your changes disappear ah you

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,290
spend money on the theme who spent $30

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,570
on the theme who spent $60 on the theme

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,390
could spend $200 on the theme

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,060
lots of people right and it's a little

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,560
scary when you start making changes

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:41,220
because if you break that theme what's

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,450
going to happen they're gonna want a

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:48,570
support contract how much $50 a month

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:52,620
$200 a month I don't know varies varies

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:58,920
a lot right I'd rather spend my money on

00:07:52,620 --> 00:08:02,340
other things like like that suit that

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,830
would be perfect yeah yeah snazzy okay

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,600
or you just made some really cool

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,710
changes that you would like to port over

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,390
to another website you you build a

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,310
website for somebody you get some great

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,070
styling changes and you really like them

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,380
and you show that site to another client

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,540
they say I love that and you want to use

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,550
those same changes again pick them up

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,200
move them to the new site that you're

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,660
building for that new person you've

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,820
already done your CSS assuming that

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,030
using the same base theme so that's

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:38,160
important

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:43,710
okay and if you really really really

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:46,540
really follow my example and screw it up

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:49,230
you can always press Delete and start

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,210
your child theme over it will not kill

00:08:49,230 --> 00:09:00,720
the parent theme it will not affect the

00:08:52,210 --> 00:09:00,720
parent theme that's the key okay hey

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:14,110
yeah we won't go there but essentially

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,790
my wife made me put in this picture it's

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,730
kind of like the file cabinet in my

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,370
garage which used to be my office

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,260
okay the two things you need to know is

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,690
there is a folder structure that's very

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,690
very important and there are essential

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:35,940
files which must be in a child theme and

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:35,940
this is the key so this is the key

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,030
no this is really the key you have a

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,560
themes folder

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:53,690
okay everybody knows that if you go into

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:57,890
your where is it into your cPanel into

00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,860
your host you have your WordPress and

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:04,100
then you go into WP content and inside

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:07,310
of WP content you have something called

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,250
themes that's a folder and inside that

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:13,880
theme folder you have one or more parent

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:16,220
theme it currently WordPress ships with

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,760
three default themes you can add other

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,710
themes into that folder and here you're

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,540
just adding another theme by creating a

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,280
new folder which you're calling the

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,880
child theme there's really nothing more

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,730
to it than that

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,550
it's a folder that's all it is but it

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:34,220
does have to have certain specific files

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,850
in there a style dot CSS file is

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,650
essential and a functions PHP file is

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,900
essential if you're not familiar with

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:44,210
these languages please do not be

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,920
frightened all the code for all the

00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,680
files I'm going to talk about today are

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,550
available on my website and may be

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,200
downloaded for a free monthly membership

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,520
of two hundred and fifty dollars per

00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,130
week thank you very much once you give

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,580
me your email address which I won't do

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,900
anything with okay so here's what it

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,900
looks like here's a folder structure

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:15,470
child themes here is the name of a

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,380
folder which is the target folder of a

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,950
sub domain I created on my website just

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,890
for this presentation so I created a

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:28,040
folder I point to the sub domain at this

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:30,740
child themes folder that's it here are

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,800
the rest of the wordpress folders within

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:37,010
this I have WP content which is where

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,950
most most developers always go first

00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,820
within that I have themes and they have

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:48,130
something to default automatic themes o

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,130
2019 which I am not in love with yet

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,790
2017 which I've used

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,610
and they absolutely love that's the one

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,320
where things scroll I don't know if

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,800
you've seen that but it's very cool but

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,440
for this I use this very standard theme

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,829
2016 I created another folder called the

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,399
2016 child I made up that name it could

00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:13,420
have been anything no seriously you can

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,420
name it anything you want okay

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:22,310
the necessary files and this is

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:26,060
essentially you must have a style dot

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:31,610
CSS in the theme folder you must have a

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:33,589
functions dot PHP file and in that

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,449
folder as well the screen size optional

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,160
but it's really cool and don't worry

00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:46,360
about custom templates we'll talk more

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:51,290
about that later okay oh okay

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:56,300
this is the style sheet what's essential

00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:59,360
here is that you declare a name for your

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,319
child theme and that's the first line

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:09,160
theme name 2016 child that's just what I

00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:12,949
called it I could have called it my

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,750
broken car but I didn't okay

00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:18,139
the other thing which is essential is

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:24,139
that you declare the template this child

00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:26,209
theme will be using the 2016 parent

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,550
theme whatever parent theme you're using

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,550
you have to declare it here the rest of

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,380
the stuff should be there quite honestly

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,839
you should put in your your developers

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,000
your RI which is your website you should

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,029
put in the license all that other stuff

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,680
a description and a version it's all

00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:50,170
good so you can keep track of it but

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:53,089
it's not essential and by the way this

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:57,500
slash and the NASS turistic declares a

00:13:53,089 --> 00:14:00,709
comment and this asterisk and the star

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,010
asked a stricter than the slash ends the

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:05,059
comment and as we all know comments are

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:11,329
ignored

00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:13,639
by programs right wrong these comments

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:17,719
at the top of the CSS file are read by

00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:24,739
the I don't know what by the browser I

00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:26,449
guess and the other one you oh well let

00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:29,779
me go back and then I haven't put in any

00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:31,639
CSS here but the CSS would follow so

00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:35,719
anything you write in terms of styles

00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:38,449
and colors and and div IDs and all that

00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:41,509
stuff would happen afterwards you do not

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:45,139
have to copy the entire mm line

00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:46,969
stylesheet of the theme you only need to

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,679
add in a few lines according to the

00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:51,019
changes that you make so it's really

00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:55,189
quite simple and it's a good way to stay

00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:57,919
organized okay the functions file

00:14:55,189 --> 00:15:01,129
functions dot PHP please do not be

00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:05,359
afraid of PHP you can copy it and paste

00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:10,429
it and it works what we're doing here is

00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:18,009
in queueing two style sheets one of

00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:20,689
which is the 2016 parent style sheet and

00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:24,679
you're going to get template directory

00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:29,599
URI this is a function that basically

00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:34,789
gives you the path to what to the style

00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:36,529
dot CSS file of the parent okay you

00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:37,939
don't have to know how to code this you

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:39,229
just know how to have to know how to

00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:41,509
copy it okay

00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:44,719
we're also going to include that means

00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:49,399
line up for when the page loads when the

00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:53,689
site loads rather the path to the child

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:56,239
theme stylesheet and now when the thing

00:15:53,689 --> 00:16:00,999
loads when the site loads these two

00:15:56,239 --> 00:16:03,999
files will get executed basically okay

00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,999
good

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:13,820
okay do not do not do not do not do not

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:18,270
believe what you read on the web please

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,040
it will kill you okay there are so many

00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:24,600
references there there are people out

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:29,339
there who back in the in the Paleolithic

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:32,520
era we're creating style sheets by by

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:36,330
declaring everything inside of the the

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,790
style dot CSS and using an include

00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,820
statement and it worked really really

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,330
well except it was slow because all the

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,190
style of sheets need to load

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,900
sequentially and it's like you go down

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,580
the path and then loading the next one

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,190
sequentially and yes it does make a

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:57,230
noticeable difference in page speed I

00:16:53,190 --> 00:17:00,990
haven't tested it with any of the metric

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:04,350
testing programs but I have I mean you

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,670
can see it so this newer method is there

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,589
but the people who did this are

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,110
well-known and so they have great SEO

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,780
and so they show up at the top of the

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:16,860
search list but avoid this at all costs

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:19,459
do not do that okay do it with the in

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:26,270
queue function with with in queue

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:30,929
statements in the in the functions.php

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:32,340
file okay now and of course we want to

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:34,530
have fun that's the title of this talk

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,470
so let's have fun with it let's give it

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:44,040
a nice picture which will remind us what

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:47,010
it is and for this one be a star no it's

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:51,480
2016 so for simplicity I just said 2016

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:56,220
does use 2016 as a PNG file and you'll

00:17:51,480 --> 00:18:02,190
upload that as well then you need to

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:04,740
name it screenshot dot PHP in your near

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:08,100
file structure now what does it look

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:11,370
like once I've done all that work I go

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:15,060
into WordPress I go into my dashboard I

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:17,670
look for themes and lo and behold I've

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,750
got 2016

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:23,070
and guess what I've got a child theme

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:28,920
2016 child that's the name that I

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:31,380
declared in the style dot CSS file and I

00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,270
gave it a picture just to remind me what

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,740
it is and besides that's fine it looks

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,200
unique and if you show that to a

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,670
customer they go oh wow I haven't seen

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,920
that on the web anywhere and you know

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,350
yeah I just stole the picture off of a

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,840
free picture site and I kind of like it

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,330
or this is a picture of my dog that's

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,750
not a picture of my dog I think that's a

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:55,550
picture something like dog ate yeah and

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:58,440
then my dog got very sick but it's a dog

00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:01,260
okay what if it doesn't work does it

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,650
ever not work yes has it ever happened

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,890
to anybody

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:14,280
really okay this is frightening not

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:16,980
every not every custom theme is

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,460
structured the same way most of them are

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:25,860
built with built with SAS files which

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,810
are partial pieces of CSS and it's

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,260
structured a little differently and lots

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:33,690
of times this straightforward approach

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:38,490
to in queueing two style sheets does not

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:40,020
work but what you can do is you can go

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:44,190
on the web and I'll show you how to do

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:46,740
that later okay how do you know you make

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:50,730
a change to your CSS file on the child

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:55,650
child theme and nothing happens that's

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:58,610
how you can test it okay the first thing

00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:02,580
you want to do is you want to use a

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:04,950
plug-in called show current template by

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,560
Joe kotti this is really excellent and

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,480
when it does is you pull down a list of

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,950
the files that are actually the

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,340
templates they're actually being used on

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,430
your page and right away you can see if

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:20,310
it's calling your child theme or not and

00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:23,370
if it's not then you have a problem like

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:26,450
maybe when I did a child theme called

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,820
Gutenberg's child I called a Gutenberg

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,500
apostrophe s child it didn't work

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,100
because of the apostle

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,040
see that doesn't work and it won't get

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:45,680
recognized it can be trivial and it can

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:45,680
actually cost you hours okay what else

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:53,280
cash I'm forever filling up my cash on

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,530
Firefox even though that Firefox is a

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,260
really high-performance browser so I

00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,450
keep a copy of opera available which I'm

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,520
always clearing out the cache because

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,000
that's about the cleanest browser that

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:11,390
there is and no bells and whistles but

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:17,970
it's good for testing okay they move on

00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:20,400
move on not pass them yeah oh and if it

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,070
doesn't work you can go on the web I was

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,770
using ocean WP which is the one of the

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,200
recommended themes for Elementor it

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:33,180
didn't work I had to do a web search I

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,300
found their code and it looked like that

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:42,090
and I copied it and pasted it and it

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:49,290
worked it's as simple as that now here's

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:52,950
the meat of our talk finally a child

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:55,590
theme needs to have certain folders and

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:58,410
certain files within the child theme

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,900
folder I have a custom templates file I

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,490
have a template part file which you may

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,450
or may not need you'll see why a

00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:09,720
functions.php file and a screenshot and

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:12,090
a style dot CSS this is a listing of the

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,980
files that actually have within these

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:17,250
folders within custom templates I

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,230
created these for within template parts

00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,500
I needed it for one of them for the

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:26,460
canvas so I created a another file here

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,920
don't be scared the code for all these

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:34,140
files is available on my website for a

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:36,690
small fee what I like to do now is I'd

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,670
like to take you down the path of a

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:43,140
website where we start with a basic page

00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:44,690
a default page and then develop some

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,940
changes to it

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,550
first change that page so it has no

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:53,600
sidebar now after we've taken out the

00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:55,460
sidebar take that code and develop a new

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,300
page template which not only has no

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,150
sidebar there's also full width and then

00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,880
take that page which is no sidebar and

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:08,030
full width get rid of the header and the

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,980
footer and then once we've gotten rid of

00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,770
the header in the footer we still have

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,680
the annoying page name so let's get rid

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,350
of the page name the title and create

00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,960
what's called a canvas many themes come

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:26,390
with the canvas not every theme comes

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:36,430
with a canvas you with me do I need to

00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:36,430
stop okay let me go on okay

00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,180
and here we go

00:23:51,800 --> 00:24:04,890
may you home you go for okay so this

00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:08,040
this website is called fun with child

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:12,240
themes and this is the homepage which

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:17,550
just describes that we're at Santa Clara

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:20,970
today Santa Clarita today and this is a

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:24,360
link to the presentation so you can get

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,080
to that and I'll give you the URL for

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,179
this as well

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:34,200
it's just child - themes dot from - this

00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:37,320
- century dot-com and now let's go to

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,520
the menu and I want to take a basic page

00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:49,950
using a child theme here I have just the

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:53,640
basic 2016 page and I put some CSS code

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:56,550
into the child theme so my child dot CSS

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,490
my style dot CSS it starts out with this

00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,320
header which just declares the name and

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,140
it's all in the comments you've seen

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,320
this before and down here I have some

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,480
super simple CSS and I'm sure you guys

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,730
seem to do a much better job than I can

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,340
on this where I'm just defining some

00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,750
spacers giving them full width giving

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,710
them a height and giving them a color

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,120
one is yellow the other is blue and then

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,300
something I use someplace else oh

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,830
there's the yellow block I just did that

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:34,140
in CSS I'm so fancy

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:36,050
oh look blue yeah that's about the best

00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,600
styling you've seen all day right I

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:42,330
didn't do it with Elementor

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,249
I love Elementor by the way I think it's

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,100
amazing I've used post Elementor and

00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:49,139
beaver builder and I have a strong

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:53,119
preference for Elementor I think it's

00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:58,139
amazing and yes you can build templates

00:25:53,119 --> 00:26:00,299
with this method and then populate them

00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,460
using Elementor because a lot of themes

00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,210
don't come with the canvas let's see

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:10,100
what else we can do

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:15,889
Oh check it out where's my sidebar oh

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:21,659
because of the I wonder if I can make

00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:24,210
yeah that's what I want to do there we

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,299
go okay so and you can see I have a

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,369
sidebar on the right maybe I don't want

00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:33,389
that sidebar so I'm gonna go to this

00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:40,529
next page page no sidebar and when we

00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:44,759
have ooh it's gone are you impressed No

00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:46,970
thank you very much and this is how you

00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,830
do it

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:53,029
create a new file name those sidebar dot

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:56,279
php' please don't be afraid of PHP okay

00:26:53,029 --> 00:27:00,779
open the default page template from your

00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:04,559
parent theme page PHP copy the entire

00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:09,720
code put it into the nose sidebar dot

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:12,269
PHP file save it of course and then

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,669
change the template name at the top to

00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:18,239
no sidebar so that you can identify it

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:21,179
does not create confusion and then to

00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:26,700
look for this one line of code that says

00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:31,129
get sidebar and just comment it out boom

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,129
your sidebar is gone yay

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:40,540
and there's my sample text but it

00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,600
doesn't take up the full width and I

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:47,440
find that extremely annoying so I'm

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,500
gonna go to page full width no that's

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:55,090
nice

00:27:49,500 --> 00:28:02,410
there it is page full width nice how did

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:04,900
I do it in the custom templates folder

00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:08,679
create a new file called page full width

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:11,080
or full with PHP copy the code from the

00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,800
one with no sidebar and change one

00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:18,309
attribute and you're done you also have

00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:22,480
to put something in the CSS file and

00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:23,730
that's the entire it's no more complex

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,620
than that

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:30,640
besides this annoying header let's get

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:34,360
rid of the header oops it's gone how'd I

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,230
do it I created a new file copy the file

00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:41,200
copy the code from the last PHP file and

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:47,350
then comment it out the you get header

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:50,830
SEC get header function this is a PHP

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:53,679
function and it's actually at the bottom

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,990
of the code so I'm helping you find it

00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:01,720
and look what we have we have a simple

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:05,890
page with no header no footer no sidebar

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:09,250
and it's full width but it still has an

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:15,250
edit thing down there I don't like that

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:19,059
so much there's no menu bar so I've got

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:21,360
a back page to get out of it and now I'm

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:23,500
going to go all the way to blank canvas

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,660
this one's a little bit more complicated

00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,850
here you have to create another folder

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:31,090
called template parts you have to create

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:32,740
a file in template parts and so I give

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,160
you all the instructions for doing that

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,160
here

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,990
rather than going through all of this

00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:47,059
let me just say that all of these files

00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:49,440
are available on my website okay

00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:51,600
and it was interesting I was looking on

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,100
the web the other day as I was writing

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,970
this going like wow how do I do this

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,409
again I forgot has been well right I

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,779
looked on the web I did a little web

00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:03,090
search and I found so many entries that

00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:08,220
say why in the world would you want to

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:09,690
get rid of the title who in the world

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,760
would want to do that that makes no

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,639
sense whatsoever and they were like 20

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,630
top ranking posts that that talked about

00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:21,539
that but in reality sometimes you do for

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:28,289
example if you wanted to unlock the

00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:30,750
secrets the amazing secret of how you

00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:35,190
will create a blank canvas without you

00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:43,950
having to pay a developer click this

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:49,100
amazing link and oh no ha ha lead

00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:51,450
capture this is actually on my main site

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,470
so if you ever has anybody ever seen

00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:58,350
those before usually in your spam box

00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:01,559
right and you read all of them and you

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:03,360
enter your email and all of them awesome

00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:07,710
I do do I have such a big spam folder

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:10,950
it's amazing I don't actually have any

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:18,690
people who email me directly but I have

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:24,500
like 300 spams a day now I said this was

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:26,970
easy what you must get right for this is

00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,549
the folder structure this might be a

00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:33,840
little difficult to read but within the

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:37,110
the child theme folder I have a folder

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,289
called custom templates I have a folder

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:45,090
called template parts I have the

00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:47,100
function dot PHP I have the green shot

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,850
which gives me the nice picture and they

00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,070
have the style dot CSS boom that's what

00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:56,210
you need at the top

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:59,780
within the custom templates folder I've

00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:01,910
created several different files okay and

00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:06,910
with the template parts folder I only

00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,910
created one Flint where can you get them

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:17,000
down here these are all the files but I

00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:19,820
uploaded them onto my server as dot txt

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,430
because I didn't want them to execute so

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,920
if you wanted to use these and suppose

00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,440
you wanted the functions file you would

00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:31,540
create your functions dot PHP file as a

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,610
new file just with the dot PHP extension

00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:37,460
it's an absolutely empty file you would

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:41,170
open this txt file copy and paste the

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,170
code let me show you

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:50,690
hung sends dot txt there's the code copy

00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:52,880
and pasted that's a present to you so

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,790
all of the templates that I've shown you

00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:04,330
today are available for you to make on

00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:10,820
your own using this assortment of files

00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:12,260
okay how are we doing on time five

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,620
minutes I don't have anything more to

00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:31,310

00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:36,890
seriously

00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:40,760
I'm a geek I'm a talking head I'm not an

00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:43,760
exercise guy my wife is was a bet was a

00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,970
ballet modern dancer it's been teaching

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,120
Pilates for 25 years and now she's a

00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:52,670
performing ballroom dancer and she'll

00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,050
come home from a coaching lesson and

00:33:52,670 --> 00:34:00,280
she'll show me what they did and she'll

00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,280
do one of these

00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:07,120
we're like one measure takes like three

00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,770
and a half minutes you know and it's

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,750
incredible amount of control I don't

00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,849
have that kind of control okay so don't

00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:24,810
worry about okay questions I'm sorry yes

00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:28,810
how can I help you okay

00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:34,290
hmm the question you can add your own

00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:38,379
modifications on to anything okay and I

00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:40,179
think under the GNU license that becomes

00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:42,220
open-source so anybody could use your

00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,500
stuff if they could find it I think

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:49,960
that's correct that's the idea of

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:51,849
WordPress it's very open other than that

00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,520
I don't know that there are any rules I

00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:57,340
mean the thing is that people sell

00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,400
themed people develop themes and to sell

00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,500
products make money it's great and if

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,510
one of those themes fits your needs

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:13,420
exactly today that's wonderful but if

00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:16,300
you decide to use it always always I've

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,820
gotten to the habit get that theme and

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,740
put on the put on the child theme even

00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,140
if it has no content even if you've made

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,359
no modifications because later on you

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:29,859
might want to make modifications and you

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,920
can add them in later okay if you slip

00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:34,660
from one from the parent theme to the

00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,200
child theme and back you may lose the

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,970
customizer unless you've exported it so

00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,420
you want to always start by having the

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:45,400
child theme created does that interest

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,270
question okay thank you

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,270
yes oh

00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:02,390
I forgot where the hell is that thing

00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:02,390
oh yeah

00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,080
give me a second

00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,740
thank you

00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:27,150
yeah have the dashes and why do I put

00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:36,120
them in not just to make it inconvenient

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:40,590
to type in the early days of SEO google

00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:42,210
talk a lot about user experience and so

00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:46,800
I said well maybe what I should do is

00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:48,840
make the the the URLs human readable

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,360
instead of just a whole endless bunch of

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,770
characters right and it turns out Google

00:36:51,360 --> 00:37:02,510
doesn't like that oh did you hear about

00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:02,510
