Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	The new editor experience has been introduced into WordPress and folks have been able to use it to create beautiful and media-rich posts. However, most don’t realize that blocks can do much more than that.
In this talk, we’ll go over just how powerful Gutenberg blocks are and how to use them to power experiences in native apps, games and video generation.

want to tell you how to play with it

00:00:52,490 --> 00:01:05,300

00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:12,979

with Bloomberg blocks cool who here

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:19,420

00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:24,409
than I expected so we're in a good place

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:26,659

00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,440
today

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,119
you know I'm MacGyver MacGyver it

00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,830
embodies you know it's a little about me

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,740
I sent a little Senna BIOS MacGyver

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:43,250
really really look up to you because

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,670
often times um you know you know I've

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,500
been the fact that CTO for Keuka a few

00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,439
companies I'm like you know having to

00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,880
lead a bunch of crazy projects and I

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,080
think if you're busted newsroom have

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,299
been there before where you're just like

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,680
you're given this project and you need

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,080
to combine this thing with that thing

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,320
and with listings and you only have like

00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,060
you know buy if I have the PHP and like

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,799
a Sunday to do it and you're thinking

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:12,560
hmm how do I do this well you know I was

00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:14,000
a I was a lapse WordPress developer

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,500
myself and until I found my way with

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,410
Gutenberg Gutenberg and good Berg has a

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,030
lot of has many excellent features that

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,489
I love and this really great it

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,160
literally lived itself to making wild

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,710
new tools so here's me with different

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,500
with like where's hair back then

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:37,070
talking about talking in we're camp

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,450
Riverside we're about you know rendering

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:44,780
Gutenberg content and have experiences I

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:47,630
know how the other guy is so over there

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,080
me and then we talked about you know

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,690
hooking up Gutenberg to VR and fax

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,860
machines I've little video that will

00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:00,110
play yeah

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,310
spoilers alright so videos and

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,680
slideshows it's always a perilous

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:09,590
journey I'm not sure if I'll work

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:12,530
alright yeah we don't get sued all right

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,540
so we have Gutenberg up before you saw

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,840
the CGI now we have good and Berger in a

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,840
fax machine

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,130
now we're faxing to Greenberg and

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,550
Gutenberg texting and here's a wat phu

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,790
and then here is something of some more

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,490
people all right but anyways greenberg

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,140
so they are demonstrating using a green

00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,340
brick and power a lot of different

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,600
things besides just like you know where

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:47,510
press web web post

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:50,800
ah perilous thank you well I escaped to

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,540
I escaped to hard

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,880
alright good works great okay we can all

00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:02,330
agree there so recap about new editor

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,280
Gutenberg did another KKK Gutenberg you

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,260
have blocks which are discrete units of

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,459
content you can go and rearrange around

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,239
and the best part about that is in the

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,540
classic editor

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,330
the only real mode you can think about a

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,690
post as it's a big blob of HTML but I

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:22,190
can think of your posts as as a series

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,190
of blocks Osaka blocks that you can move

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:28,250
together really easily instead of you

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,419
know just having just having one big

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,740
blob of text so Harrison Jenga blocks

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,080
Jacob blocks there's a rumor that

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,320
someone made signal blocks flavor

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,490
gutenberg block somewhere yeah i don't

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,479
know where to buy them but if someone

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,599
knows please tell the audience later

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,169
all right but today we're gonna talk

00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:51,900
about you know making some crazy blocks

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:55,139
so oh here gets how about using blocks

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,999
to power native mobile content you know

00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,729
there's typically what you see a typical

00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:02,520
use case and then we use convert blocks

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,069
to author it authorized interactive

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,559
content like quizzes which is quizzes is

00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:13,979
a legitimate form of of news now and

00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:17,129
also a little extra using Gutenberg into

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:19,080
a better production pipeline which you

00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,330
know it's it's if everybody on social

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,580
media you see those you know square

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,349
videos that says Business Insider you

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,689
won't believe how this world has changed

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,139
it's like a flying like playing or

00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,939
whatever

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,810
and they're all awful except when there

00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,979
abouts through them they're great and

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,960
you know what about food they're great I

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,330
love them and then I was wondering and

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,349
it's something I wondered myself is like

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,270
how can you automate those because you

00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,409
know it's right cookie cutter right now

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,580
parallel people have spent a lot of

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,490
thought into this so you know I thought

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,279
this beeper apropos all right

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,449
so later on today you can go to

00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,339
snackable dot app and it's it's it's a

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,580
great site and it's mainly about junk

00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:03,120
food and the Guyver so you know browser

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,569
at your leisure after this talk and also

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,629
a coming soon coming soon there will be

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,819
a cycle to app Android app in the Play

00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:14,819
Store so please like it look forward to

00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:18,060
that but anyways let's talk about that

00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:22,789
app MacGyver means a junk food it's

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:25,649
great so when I was building the sites

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:34,339
likable that app I did have some guiding

00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:38,129
principles first first one of the things

00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:39,419
was I did not want you know I you know I

00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:44,879
mentioned already like the classic

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:47,699
editor classic editor had all your posts

00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,539
us like one big HTML blob and you know

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:54,240
who here in the room is a developer

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:55,920
okay so yeah you know and we've all been

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,560
before you know you scrape a bunch

00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,690
of HTML soup and then you think it's

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,020
gonna be a straightforward you know a

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:06,390
selector to grab like this part of the

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,250
elements in this big list and turns out

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,230
it's like 15 edge cases you know account

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,710
for and partially deal is very difficult

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:15,540
right well when when I first saw

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,550
Gutenberg out one of things I thought it

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,950
was like wait I don't have to define my

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,410
posts in terms of like you know big text

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:25,350
blobs right I can just use these blogs

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,360
and then interpret those blocks as the

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,580
structured hierarchical content where I

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,190
can work and then in turn you know

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,580
and can we that later on so you know I'm

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,740
a little diagram for this i'm greenberg

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,620
blocks it's like this it's like thinking

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,050
the left and then this is how you know i

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,250
I feel about the class get over you know

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:50,250
because this is the kind of output you

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:52,740
get and you know you know when you're

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,360
building an application and using like

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,850
you know WordPress is like fun mental to

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,830
get your content strategy it's like

00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,300
which would you rather work with you

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:06,780
know a bunch of a bunch of blocks or

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:08,570
just crumbled up receipts you know you

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:14,250
are correct

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:16,950
all right so exactly so the idea is that

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,200
it is you have one data source schema on

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:23,030
the left and then you can protect it in

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,210
many ways in different forms all right

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,120
all right

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:31,080
another thing is in a soccer ball app

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,110
all the data and the posts is strictly

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,970
just content meaning that I'm not using

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,100
in the column layouts I'm not using any

00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:41,850
of the any of like the presentation

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:45,330
layouts because because in that scheme

00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:47,850
is like all that should be done on the

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,440
theme side on the theme side on the

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,850
theme side on the client side what

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
whether it be your native client I game

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:56,070
client or or whatever is ingesting it so

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,670
that way that if you need to make

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,490
changes to how things are laid out or

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,320
you need to make big changes to multiple

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,270
big sweeping changes to your data like

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
your content they're not mixed together

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,890
it'll be a lot of used to Rickett reason

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,630
about

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,940
and I'm sure we've all been there before

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,650
where you have a bunch of like

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,330
presentational divs you go in the code

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,530
editor in the house calendar and you put

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,810
in a bunch of you know cheeky divs

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,270
everywhere and it works great it works

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,440
great for like you know a year ago and

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,450
then we can go back and because your

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,760
clients or whoever you know watch you

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,650
look at it you're like what did i do

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,300
again you know we've all been there

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,820
before

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,950
so having like this point where you

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,860
think of your content strictly as data

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,660
we really remove that burden from you

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,690
it's a little bit more work upfront but

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,330
you know it's a lot easier down the road

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,950
so I think of it as you know the

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,100
difference is if you dis plan and you

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:54,220
think of your there's content spreading

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,460
presentation layer name it as a Swiss

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,410
Army knife where ask you know if you but

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,570
know one little all in at once you know

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,190
you get this guy this guy works great

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:09,550
you know for a first few months and then

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:12,700
it breaks all right and then one thing

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,590
one thing I love is and I always try

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,310
Parton is content authoring user

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:22,660
experiences Paramount's who hear you has

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:25,030
a really short codes before and rehearse

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,520
yet has ever use short codes to embed

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:30,370
rich widgets or like you know data or

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,160
whatever inside your posts right and

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,350
whoever and and like you know I'm gonna

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,330
show you something that we fought with

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,780
we've already all probably experienced

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,540
before

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,600
no eventually when you when you work

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,450
with a post right when we're to post and

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,500
you want to do something I want do

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,390
something little more complicating we

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,670
have like rich because everyone wants

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:55,900
that rich nice and me to experience the

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,090
Petersons liking Elissa composure cause

00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,800
together right but but you know we have

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,710
to look at it and the output you end up

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,930
with something like this and then this

00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:09,280
is a you know a little scared look at

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:11,890
right and and I don't care if if you're

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,270
not if you're someone who you prefer if

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,340
someone who prefers like to edit the

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:20,200
codes of themselves I like like for this

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:22,889
kind of things because I see you know 15

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,420
places right here reckoning stakes

00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,860
mechanics mistakes and you know short

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,720
codes can be very tough mental bit so

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,940
how to implement it and you know you put

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:36,819
like a wrong ear on bar somewhere and

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,990
all of a sudden your post is broken you

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:43,259
know you have phone calls before in the

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:46,089
morning right so now this is not optimal

00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,740
content edit experience right it's it's

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,519
to me too many places to make this dance

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,649
and you know it's hard to reason about

00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,379
when you're going through an editing

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:58,209
content which which it's not good

00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:59,769
because you put especially with like you

00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:02,439
know a very creative demanding job like

00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:05,519
current often content you want as little

00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:08,889
cognitive wall as possible

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,350
so then what we're gonna show look at

00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:14,050
later is this so this is a little plug

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,819
and I route for offering quizzes you

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,089
have a sidebar right here where you

00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:22,449
defined your topics and you can use

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:25,000
blocks on the left to offer your

00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:28,740
questions and there are nice things for

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,380
example it the plug-in right now demand

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,689
requires you that you make all options

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,860
equally possible and that's great

00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,660
because this because that's a rule

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,829
that's enforced inside the editor so you

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,850
don't have a situation where I was like

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:44,290
okay the intern then turn a you know foo

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,550
bar to question and the whole thing

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,279
breaks because and then the Mac doesn't

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,610
work out and also like when you look at

00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,480
it and you see where it really clearly

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,980
that okay

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,560
okay question block here the question

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,230
block is a question block now the good

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,740
thing about this is is that instead of

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,100
having having just a custom plugin or

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,620
cut some UI interface for editing just a

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,240
quiz content right because these are

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,839
greeting block Gutenberg blocks you can

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,819
also do things like in bed and insert

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,009
other block other green blogspot blocks

00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,059
installed in your site so you can do

00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,129
things like you know there's no reason

00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:23,410
why you can put an image at the top put

00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:25,990
some copy paragraph blocks below each

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,370
question or like you know what we're

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,939
gonna do later is put a big five picture

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:34,180
of MacGyver at the bottom but you know I

00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:36,840
think you know I think and don't add me

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,890
and this is a bet a much better editing

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:48,920
than just editing shortcuts all right

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:51,120
content types so in stackable there are

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,460
three content types

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,700
the content types the article normal

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,710
posts one thing I find about Bloomberg

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,750
recently is which is really cool feature

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,760
is you can restrict what count blocks

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,640
the Gutenberg editor is allowed to use

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,800
which is great because sometimes you

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,720
know when you when your client wants to

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,450
give you the tools ask for the tools to

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,060
work on the site which is which you know

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,430
sounds great in theory because this

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,870
that's ideally less work for you but

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,120
then you realize you'll have some got

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:25,710
some doors unlocked and you know they do

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,940
something bad it's all broken but you

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:35,330
know it's cool presto post and the

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:37,710
outputs the Gutenberg blog output is is

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:40,290
pretty possible previously reason about

00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:43,280
which means it can we interpret it

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,280
really easily way too many devices

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:56,770
there we go Wilson VIX offered a quizzes

00:14:50,170 --> 00:15:00,190
so in the scheme we have quizzes as a

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,930
separate post type because really when

00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,660
you think about the kind of are because

00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,730
you know when you're going to consume a

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,120
quiz there's something interact it's an

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,560
unattractive content where you have your

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,360
reader or consumer actually

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,190
participating in the content and like

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,660
interacting with it whereas peasant's

00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,090
more passive right and it makes sense to

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,190
have that separation but for all the

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:25,480
purposes is a normal post you can use

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,980
post blocks like typical post creation

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,570
blogs like paragraph image and all that

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,850
with it

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:35,530
as I mentioned earlier you have controls

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,900
in the plug-in and check them plug-in to

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,300
make sure the quiz is still valid which

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:44,080
you know we all make mistakes and they

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:47,350
wanna make sure that's all you know we

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:52,060
have a basket I looked after him and

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:55,540
also your generation so taking that quiz

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,310
together we can spit it out to WordPress

00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,440
and spread it out to new clients and

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,660
then trip out data as a quiz but you

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,880
know why not go step further make those

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,680
fun videos for the asking questions and

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,200
a bunch of chocolate statements you know

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,040
but once I ask what time do you wake up

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,900
in the morning so and in a bit I'm gonna

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,880
ask some for some audience participation

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:22,000
we're gonna make a quiz and then we can

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:26,700
turn it to video all right and then one

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,950
thing I want to cut us off with is is

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,660
using thinking of WordPress this way

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:36,910
it's not just strictly for presentation

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:39,520
but as a way to just you know manage

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:43,150
your content write a system to manage

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,850
your content is and you know having this

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,890
having this point to make sure all the

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,050
content to separate from all the

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:53,230
presentation logic that allows your data

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,820
to be consumed by you know a bunch of

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,520
other devices and experiences that you

00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,470
may you might have earlier I talked

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,610
about

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:06,870
me and I friend up there Leo we use

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:12,030
greenberg to power text message messages

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:17,620
fax machines VR VR and I think there's a

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:19,929
TTY in there but we also can you can use

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:23,880
it for other things like you know video

00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:26,470
generation and I'm sure if if one

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,320
enterprising individual were wanting out

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,610
to it toast into a toaster but there

00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,450
wasn't the reason why it's possible is

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:37,030
because the data is very clean

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,919
structured and and easier to interpret

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,650
and in a format that's that can be

00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:46,390
consumed by and understood by many many

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:49,090
different devices so you know there's no

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,040
reason why you can't have your WordPress

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,179
content I have an endpoint in the REST

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,799
API go and have it be consumed by

00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,919
service function or a source understand

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:03,370
that runs a job to generate PDFs or no

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,770
books or pamphlets or whatever or you

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,770
know in like any games I get for a game

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,570
developer you want to have you want to

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,740
have all your content in a separate

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,770
place because games are really complex

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,330
so you want to be able to you know have

00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:19,630
the authoring team author out the

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:21,820
content and that means a characters lore

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,280
images and all that right well all the

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,730
game engineers worry about what kind of

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,140
clients and then you know if we have a

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,679
clean contract in to clean API between

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,960
the two you know that's what makes a big

00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,370
games possible I thinking it's possible

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,020
because otherwise you know if you have

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:44,580
situation where where yes someone hey so

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,960
I tried parsing big smell again it broke

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,929
you know those are conversations

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,520
nonetheless want to have alright

00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:56,530
that's we got so the the source code

00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,780
will be available here but I'm not sure

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:02,110
if I made a public yet so I'll just do

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:06,190
that really quick check

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:07,360
all right so while I so while I check

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:20,559
this does anyone have any questions

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:25,230
before the demo map let's see this this

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,230
is embarrassing me

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:38,970
so we have all wordpress code here

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:45,389
settings danger zone thank you

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,389
we're on the same page friend all right

00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:53,370
cool dude dudes do you do

dude get doo doo doo doo all right all

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:32,920
right double check cool all of the code

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:36,880
will be available at you know about calm

00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:43,360
slash snackable apps all right so let's

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:48,390
go so let's go to some demos all right

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:52,740
so let's show the quiz all right

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:56,520
Sergio look pop quiz

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,590
you know what POC is yeah all right cool

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,850
save this may be a better time so I have

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:07,050
a question what time do you wake up in

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:07,050
the morning that's a good answer

00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,480
what kind of burger do you like your

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:21,280

Islands what is your favorite Guttenberg

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,560
block paragraph image column or quiz

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:38,790
good answer I can't find my curtsy here

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,790
we go what kind peril could do you like

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:54,929
yeah so so so Leo could you explain what

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:58,890
appear okay so imagine

00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:58,890

beef you are a vanilla hockey all right

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:17,590
so let's go let's go in the back end and

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:19,600
see you see how this works I'm not

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:28,440
logged in damn it

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:36,299
alright dude dude dude hmm right oh

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:36,299
there's more hmm what is my password

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,680
doo-doo-doo-doo I think this is it

00:22:52,620 --> 00:23:04,750
exactly alright alright so let's go in

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:09,880
here let's do it again

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:12,840
make sure all right cool the post all

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,890
right so here's the big picture Pocky

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,190
what time do you wake in the morning so

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:22,360
each of the questions are blocks right

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:26,110
each of the questions are blocks and you

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,610
know instead of just doing what I did

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,650
before why I showed before with asteroid

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,300
codes where you're in the classic editor

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,670
and you're doing a bunch of like weird

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,800
brackets everywhere and doing choice one

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,270
frat race and all that and you know

00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,050
having to do a bunch of fiddly bits in

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:42,520
order to compose your contents all

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,280
that's done for you and the good work

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,110
editor and these nice blocks blocks and

00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,320
you know you can include position

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,900
elements like include a your salt at the

00:23:50,320 --> 00:24:00,850
bottom so I really wanted to so now

00:23:52,900 --> 00:24:07,020
let's change it let's go here and move

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:11,700
to the bottom goes in the middle library

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:16,930
pick some Cool Ranch Doritos update it

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:20,410
and view the post and you can see we

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,990
have an image box up here and we have an

00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:28,980
image block at the bottom and the quiz

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,980
still works so pick some random options

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:41,620
Nilla so how so with what the rules

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:45,440
of the quiz how it works is each each

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:52,190
answer to eight questions is associated

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:55,760
with a with a topic so and what it does

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,020
is it takes them a maximum of each of

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,020
each of the topics and then that's the

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:04,100
topics you get based on my answer and

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:07,280
what school is is the Gutenberg API the

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,740
API you know it's a bit of a pain in the

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:13,460
neck but let's get past it you can do

00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:17,750
cool things like this if I add a block

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,850
if I add a topic here it shows up for

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,870
all the questions so lots of what

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:26,780
similar flavor Pocky

00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:28,010
there is a rum Pocky well what time what

00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,620
time would have run drinker to wake up

00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:34,880
in the morning 4:00 p.m. is a good one

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:39,890
well what kind of burger burger whatever

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:47,420
and pop what run Pocky eater like burger

00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:49,630
king a REM Pocky favorite Greenberg

00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,630
block

00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:06,280
nice for favorite pure oak flavor bankin

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:10,700
[Music]

00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:16,790
alright so then let's insert a block low

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:20,500
the image breakup block find out what

00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,500
Pocky you are

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:33,460
are you vanilla vanilla AF go use a

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:38,090
binocular are you hella run alright

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:40,700
update did we break a client site no

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,650
we're good okay so if I select all the

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,690
last options

00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:47,260
oh if we just made they should deliver

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,260
rim Pocky

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:54,140
okay red Pocky wakes up at 4:00 p.m.

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,140
eats Burger King likes a YouTube and pay

00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:03,770
block and likes bacon pure Oaks run

00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:07,340
Pocky alright so that's all cool and all

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:11,570
but I also said there would be the be

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:14,710
video so let's go look at that so

00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:17,090
originally I was going to introduce

00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:20,390
introduce finish regeneration and

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:22,570
porting to like a video editor that will

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,370
rename remain unnamed that costs

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:28,010
thousands of dollars but I think I was

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,930
like now now that's a little in a that's

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,820
like you know not not very MacGyver

00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,170
thing to do so we're gonna I'm trading

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,800
example using all open-source software

00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:38,330
and you can take this today with a

00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,030
little bit of macgyvering in fact a lot

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,040
and a lot I'm a guy ring a lot of

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,220
macgyvering and you'll be able to

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,960
instantiate this and have your own video

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:55,520
content by pipeline with the code you

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:58,700
see on the repo so I'm going so I'm

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,080
using this thing called abusing a Python

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,820
not with you generate those you don't

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,120
know about the great because it lets you

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,940
have code along with pros and your notes

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,799
so you know

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,210
right duck South documented in code and

00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,710
stay for one of those things where

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,330
you're messing with a bunch of code and

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:17,279
not quite sure what you're doing like I

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:18,929
was okay and also for those in the back

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:24,870
or wherever where you can't see it very

00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:32,149
well let me know it's like a zoom in all

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:35,309
right we good go up all right

00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:36,299
so here we have this is a public

00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:38,450
endpoint ever can we eight it's

00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:45,929
read-only I hope so

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:48,509
here is the your eye for the quiz that

00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:50,009
we were working on and if I and what

00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:52,679
we'll do is go through and print some

00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:56,309
blocks about it in some information

00:28:52,679 --> 00:29:02,210
about it so it will put the title and

00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:05,759
then this is what the box looks like so

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:11,070
this is this is I'm somewhat even

00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:12,809
readable but but you know we're not

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,360
we're not the ones gonna kiss him into

00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:18,000
this the program is the programs and

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,429
things we build are going to consume

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,990
this and this is much far easier to

00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,960
consume than just like you know a bunch

00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:27,500
of like this big ball they should melt

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,840
it's like and poke out with jQuery

00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,639
anyways anyway it's content you so you

00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,860
can see it like you can see like the 4

00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:36,480
p.m. here is something we added at it

00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,070
right and then we can go through and

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,149
with our clients with our client edits

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,580
interpret this content and do whatever

00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:45,899
we want

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,279
all right so the volsangs checkers will

00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:51,740
I'll make sure stuff works first you

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:54,269
know all right so here's a text-based

00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,429
interpretation of the quiz you read so

00:29:54,269 --> 00:30:00,649
if you're old school you can just send

00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:05,580
this to your LM printer all right

00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:08,610
so sob story is a magnet a black it'll

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:11,759
happen Sparky interested so I'm here I

00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:16,230
want to share all our quizzes show up so

00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:19,320
all our brand pocket options are there

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:22,080
cool alright so I'm using this library

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,630
called movie Pi which is a nice

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,860
convenient wrapper around ffmpeg because

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,880
ready I have MPEG on its own is a

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,360
soul-crushing activity in this nice

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,799
light life this nice light library you

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:40,740
know abstract side which makes which

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:42,450
makes a lot easier so I have this nice a

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:48,360
nice little function that makes a

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:50,279
caption mix a caption and I have this

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,169
function right here as Python function

00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,260
right here that takes it and slays the

00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:56,549
video I'm having trouble with cash and

00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:03,139
time I put the fiddled Explorer for a

00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:09,000
bit and let's change the text to hello

00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:13,940
WordCamp santa clarita yeah let's go out

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,179
a few years mmm I'm a jerk so let us

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:20,190
look at this and hope it's not cached

00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:25,100
cool it's a little small let's make the

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,100
font size bigger doot doot doot doot

00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:37,940
well alright that's all too big we get

00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,760
the point so so what's great about this

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,610
is is that you can take this and deploy

00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,820
it deploy it like if when you plant

00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,980
something like this take videos and

00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,410
templates done by your design team or

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:56,510
your video production team and then ask

00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:58,640
him to put empty spaces for your text

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:02,540
and then you can write a program like

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,420
this and poet on say say like a ec2

00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:08,420
instance or lamda instance and on the

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,970
man just generate these videos right and

00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,620
it's great it's great apps kind of thing

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,110
because you can do it for like say

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,360
building proofs like if you ever have to

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,680
like do a quick editor for a proof with

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,620
a bunch of video you know it's also a

00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,060
soul-crushing activity sometimes but you

00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,540
know back you know if a tenant Sergio

00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,610
talks

00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,760
sorry just talk earlier you know these

00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,280
these are kind of things like those

00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,290
things to do again again where let's

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,850
automate right so I think the important

00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,440
takeaway of this is know if there are

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:40,300
soul-crushing activities you do on a

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:43,820
daily basis try to obligate them alright

00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:48,830
so we have our data and we have video

00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:51,350
let's try to combine them so here is a

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:55,010
bunch of logic goes through and make

00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:58,610
some stuff and iterate through it it

00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:01,310
reads through all the choices and then

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:03,920
on the post there is other topics are

00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,510
saved as manatee out on the post post

00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,510
and what it does it goes through and

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:11,600
combines them all in a way that we can

00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,980
interpret later I'm gonna go into this

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,160
once you really that's one that will

00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,590
pass me but but just just not like what

00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,480
this code does it just go through and

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:24,470
timaeus all data together so we can go

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,590
through and Jennifer clips as if it

00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:31,070
works it's going through one by one

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:34,460
generating clips takes time and now the

00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:36,070
clip for memory let's make sure they're

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,639
there

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:49,340
cool a zoomed-out we're good all right

00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:51,019
and then let's generate the video all

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,539
right I don't trust the cache subs and

00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,109
you know think take it my destined to my

00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:59,119
own hands

00:33:54,109 --> 00:34:02,330
all right so the very big text we could

00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:04,099
spend five hours trying to trying to

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,849
make the text all nice and neat but you

00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:09,260
know not that but but I will do is

00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:16,220
superimpose McIver's face on the

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:19,369
background image so we're gonna go in to

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:25,929
meet our media library find this nice

00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:25,929
play for MacGyver in a save image as I

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:32,619
remember where I put my stuff it's good

00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:50,519
this is riveting television people it

00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:57,910
snackable video Maki Maki Mac that JPEG

00:34:50,519 --> 00:35:00,519
save cool nice haven't got alright and

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:07,359
then we're going to open up a a certain

00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:14,619
image editor no no it rents off up for

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:19,900
okay I wish I were though actually let

00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:21,690
us absolute you know I'll be I'll be a

00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:28,779
little bit more interesting if I do this

00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:30,249
Mac jpg so well does is is I really was

00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:33,720
gonna crop and do nice things with that

00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:37,839
but you know we want that raw experience

00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:41,019
so I'm gonna go oh God alright I have a

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:44,499
time limit guys the bombs off all right

00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:46,660
all right cool alright I am generating

00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:47,230
content right here generating content

00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,799
right here

00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,700
and then I am I'm going through and

00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:55,660
making sure it's correct

00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,950
alright now that now that I have now

00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,960
that have the clock all the cups of

00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,190
memory I'm going to stitch them all

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,079
together can counting the videos

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:09,700
together like how you would in a

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:12,489
sequence in any video editor alright no

00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:18,940
errors and then we will go in here and

00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:22,599
refresh something happened

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:27,029
oh no it's too small all right go back

00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:27,029
and change what we did

00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:40,029
by this is the one okay all right so I

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:45,759
cut the wrong wire which but no one died

00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:48,009
yet so all right all right look

00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:51,009
all right make sure okay we saw the

00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:54,970
personal video I'll open the not to be

00:36:51,009 --> 00:37:01,650
named takes a photo editor all right

00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:01,650
we're gonna find a way back all right

00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,089
cool

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:06,089
go here

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,060
and then we got nice nice multiply cool

00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:24,360
safer web all right you know because you

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,570
know that's how my guy ever does right

00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:32,060
all right let's go back we're going to

00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:32,060
go through the Allah make our sub clips

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:40,460
make sure their memory I'm really scared

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,460
right now it'd be my love - oh my god oh

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:57,570
no no there is I don't want to hear it

00:37:48,030 --> 00:38:01,020
yeah we got it all right you got it go

00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:11,160
up all right we got ten minutes

00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:15,060
ish questions yes yeah and again all the

00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,740
source code if you want if you want to

00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:27,000
look at it and it's pretty inspected

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:29,940
they're all my laptop died well yeah so

00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,440
all all the code is available on github

00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:37,020
if I inspected the UM is code Mitchell

00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,450
languages a Bushman we have time to demo

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,990
the mobile app the mobile but the mobile

00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:45,600
app is written up there is it's up there

00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,070
if I look at - and it's the summer kind

00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:53,460
experience of web on the web be able to

00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:54,450
like take the quiz also and it's the the

00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,730
repair of the fall dance

00:38:54,450 --> 00:39:00,320
I didn't I didn't put any documentation

00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,320
up yet so to see me but

00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:11,979
so movie booby Pie is a so many pie all

00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:14,599
it is is a method to to construct videos

00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:16,729
like with us with MPEG so it's akin to

00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,549
asking if like you know why can't open

00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:20,930
shot or like or like the kitty video

00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:25,819
editor uploaded to YouTube right cuz

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:27,890
that's not really its job yes exactly so

00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:29,900
if if one was the enterprising

00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,849
individual one could have this pipeline

00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,329
crazy pipeline where you where you take

00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,739
your posts take your posts and then plug

00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:38,150
into something like you know workflow

00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:40,099
thing that's really complicated cost

00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,960
lots of money and then you picked that

00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,670
and and then how does through the

00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,729
approval process where where you have

00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:49,489
five people vetted and then it and then

00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:51,700
just have that the content go through

00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:54,529
the same method for producing video and

00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,690
then after that proof it and then and

00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:58,910
then whatever treatment you want to do

00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:01,430
with it and update whatever video

00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:03,079
sources to but that but idea is if

00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,779
you're having code so you can describe

00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,819
you can actually build those things that

00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:10,969
inscribing instead of just having to

00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:13,489
have five plugins or whatever tried

00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:25,099
accordion together so so what you're

00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:27,979
saying is if I publish snappy yes yes I

00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:30,680
can make mean content in Guttenberg that

00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:32,539
that appears in video form that then

00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,289
syndicates out my content everywhere

00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:39,289
correct but also all the coast GPL long

00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:40,700
enough to say no it's not going to say

00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:45,499
thank for propane accessories going to

00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:49,809
be propane feed exactly all right

00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:53,559
any more questions all right

00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:53,559
any more questions yes

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:13,810
so right now it's a lot of a guy ring

00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,970
but perhaps some other and enterprising

00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:17,890
individual in this room does like

00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:20,560
MacGyver ring and publishes that

00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:26,490
macgyvering open-source and I'm sure is

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,490
that with you yeah exactly

00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,610
all right

00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,610
any more questions

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,020
every option except me

00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:19,540
so the question was how to make a kind

00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,220
of questionnaire where where you say if

00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:27,960
you do this then the second block

00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:31,540
appears okay so that is very possible

00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,790
with the Gutenberg API very possible so

00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,410
you know I can like they actually

00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:37,780
complain about the Gutenberg API for

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,900
days that's true but anything can be

00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:43,000
anything but it's very powerful and

00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,260
those are the kind of features features

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,170
that's really meant for where you have

00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:50,680
like the ability to describe very scribe

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:54,730
logically logically pluses like that in

00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,010
your content however it does and however

00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,420
in order to create that experience you

00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:02,260
have to get really familiar with react

00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:06,160
and redux ap redux which is what the

00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:08,170
gutenberg AP api block EPA uses but once

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,810
you get once you get get that down then

00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,880
then creating that experience will be a

00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,460
relatively straightforward but you know

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:23,800
it's still a lot of work to do

00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:28,359
alright that's one question over here so

00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:31,720
this is a way of life because this this

00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:35,020
laptop right here is ridiculously

00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,319
expensive and has like a Xeon and like a

00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,510
NVIDIA Quadro in it and it's also late

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:43,630
tales like ten pounds but one thing I

00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:45,130
always do is free to plug it in and you

00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:50,109
know when you when you live that life

00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:52,680
you live that life right all right how

00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:52,680
are you doing on time

00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:06,359
right exactly okay so I'm not competing

00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:10,200
enterprising publisher with my stackable

00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:11,220
be calm and I'm really trying to get

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,869
some competitive advantage

00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:17,760
what else could I use the Gutenberg API

00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:20,220
data to do hmm

00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,910
well you can use to make it any

00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:27,270
experience where you need your content

00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:29,010
you want to make rich content and you

00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,859
want that content to behave in a certain

00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:33,630
way in turn the way because you can

00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:39,359
verify the correctness of that content

00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:40,830
in editor so you know that's what what

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,260
what that's really powerful about

00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:45,390
Gutenberg editor is is you know it's

00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,970
clunky it's weird you get some weird bug

00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:50,490
sometimes but but the future is the hope

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:53,210
is you can have all these fancy API is

00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:56,540
where you can go through and make more

00:44:53,210 --> 00:45:00,060
powerful editing tools like for example

00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,130
what if you have a plug-in where you

00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,630
know apparently people really care if

00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,760
you spell breakfast correctly with a

00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,869
capital P but I feel plug-in writing

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,490
that your editor where it'll

00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:11,060
automatically change all your paragraph

00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:14,310
knows - it's about WordPress correctly

00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,470
or you make sure make sure that your

00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,369
images are a certain size it's not the

00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,990
editor and you could have visual

00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:23,130
feedback for well whether that's true or

00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:24,720
not or frankly you know if it often

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:28,830
right now a shortcode for us my life

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,770
I'll be more content on it than anything

00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:37,849
cuz you know short codes are awful sorry

00:46:06,439 --> 00:46:22,140
all right cool

00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:23,309
some questions cold coming into this how

00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,349
long did it take you to pick up

00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:27,420
Gutenberg was it a really experienced

00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:31,799
and are you looking for an important

00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:33,479
future or okay so it took me about so

00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:35,759
okay so it took me about like a week to

00:46:33,479 --> 00:46:37,439
learn friedenberg API but that's because

00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:40,289
I had react and real experience

00:46:37,439 --> 00:46:42,989
so most of mike's my experience was

00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:45,779
where the api was was fighting the

00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:47,009
ambiguous documentation but still work

00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:49,019
in progress and people were working on

00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:52,410
it but about the time the documentation

00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:55,049
for gutenberg api block api wasn't very

00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:57,299
good but apps are working working with

00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:58,579
it because like I'm someone so I was

00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:01,769
live I was allowed for the rest of a

00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:04,019
developer and I came in right when

00:47:01,769 --> 00:47:05,640
Gutenberg started happening and people

00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:09,599
started liking now saying the world was

00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:12,359
going to end so as someone who despises

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:18,859
the classic editor I you know will

00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:18,859
embrace our Gutenberg future already

00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,390
any other questions

00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,430

00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:43,640

00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:43,640

00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:56,820
