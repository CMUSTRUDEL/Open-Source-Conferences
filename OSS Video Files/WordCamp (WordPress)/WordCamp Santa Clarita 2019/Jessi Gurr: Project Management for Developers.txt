Title: Jessi Gurr: Project Management for Developers
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	April 6, 2019, 10 am Horseshoe Ranch Room, University Center, College of the Canyons — Whether you are working as a freelancer, or as part of a team, chances are that communicating with customers falls somewhere in your job description. As a website developer, you love the part of your job where you get to develop – but you also need to develop communication and project management skills to help you stay on top of projects, interact with your customers, and make sure that projects don’t spiral out of control or take more money or time than you budgeted.
In this talk, Jessi Gurr will discuss the basics of project management. You’ll learn techniques for getting a project started on the right foot – things like making sure that your customer contracts are crystal clear, and setting up clear timelines and project milestones. You’ll also learn how to handle scope creep, and how to deal with projects that have fallen off course.

cedar will be at a word camp in just a

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,340
few years I'm pretty sure he's he's

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,860
interested in following in in the

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,960
WordPress footsteps that I have been

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,340
working on so my talk project management

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,770
for developers the reason that I put

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,229
this together is because I started my

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,439
business back in 2005 as just me

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,900
solopreneur I was the website designer I

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,250
was the website developer and I was also

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,610
the person answering all of the phone

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,380
calls and as my business grew the first

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,390
people that I started to hire were in

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,040
production so I started hiring more web

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,350
designers and we ended up in a unique

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,450
situation and I don't know this this may

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,759
sound familiar to some of you possibly

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,020
but I would have my web developers or

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,700
myself get on the phone and talk

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,280
directly to the customer about what they

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,750
were looking for and the customer would

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,649
say hey I need a seven-page website and

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,280
the web designer would say oh that's

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,869
great okay pretty simple seven pages so

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,000
you know we get him a quote for their 7

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,820
page websites on the dotted line and as

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,200
soon as the project starts customer gets

00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,970
back on phone with the designer and says

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,140
hey I I actually forgot I've got three

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,269
more services I think we should

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,959
highlight those all out is that gonna be

00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,989
a problem

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,519
so as a web designer it's not too hard

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,890
especially if you're using WordPress to

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,140
just add three more pages slap some

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,300
content up there great good to go

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,040
all right customer your 7 page website

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,629
has now

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,700
turned into a 10 page website but it

00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:36,049
wasn't a lot of extra time we'll let it

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:39,230
slide how does it look and inevitably

00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:41,329
the customer said oh that's right I've

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,400
got four employees would it be cool if

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:46,099
they all had their BIOS on our website

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,930
maybe we could have a fancy team page

00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,079
where the photos flipped when you

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,609
scrolled over them and by this point you

00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:55,549
know you just want your customer to be

00:02:52,609 --> 00:03:00,769
super happy and again you know it's just

00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:02,629
a super simple team plug in and you take

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:05,599
up a couple of BIOS you put their

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:07,189
pictures up on the website and the next

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,230
thing you know you're just about to

00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,629
launch the site when your customer says

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,819
hey you know that contact form wouldn't

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,739
it be really sweet if people filling out

00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,230
that form could determine or could tell

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,060
me if they're a customer or if they have

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,129
a new sales inquiry and wouldn't it be

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,959
cool if they were already a customer the

00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:26,389
fields changed so they could fill out

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,129
their name and their website that they

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,409
already have with me and other

00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,810
information but if they were maybe an

00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:35,169
inquiry and wanted to buy from me they

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,459
could change they could fill out

00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:38,359
different fields based on the products

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,549
and services that were they were

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,229
interested in and so alright we're

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,669
already using gravity forms pretty easy

00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:45,079
to set up conditional logic not a

00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,569
problem let's just go ahead and build

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,010
that into your contact page and now

00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:53,120
we're pretty much done with your site

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,099
but wait the day before launch your

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,479
customer signs up for a live chat

00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,299
service because they saw it on another

00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,519
website and wouldn't it be nifty if

00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,109
everyone visiting their website could

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,419
contact them through a little chat box

00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,799
and so this is super easy you guys have

00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,329
all done this before right you just get

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,709
the JavaScript code from your customer

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:14,989
put it in the header and it works right

00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:16,699
away right super simple no no but but

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,349
again you know the designer wants to

00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:20,030
make the customer happy at any expense

00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:21,940
and so they're gonna they're gonna go

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,659
ahead and they're gonna fight with this

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,740
JavaScript they're gonna put it in the

00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,940
wrong place in the header they're gonna

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,110
find out it needs to be in the footer

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,190
then they're gonna find out it has to go

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,750
back in the header and they're going to

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,159
have to make custom buttons and custom

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,639
graphics and

00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:38,429
and the websites ready to go live oh but

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,550
wait what if we just put a contact form

00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:43,080
in the footer just three fields simple

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,719
simple easy and then we're done I

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,089
promise I promise right so what's

00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,619
happened here what's happened here is

00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:52,769
that you've sold your customer a

00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:55,739
seven-page website and what they got was

00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:58,379
a whole lot of stuff they didn't pay you

00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:59,839
to do anybody familiar with this has

00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,819
this happened to anybody

00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:06,149
some people in their room all right so I

00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,009
like to get a feel for who I'm I'm kind

00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,659
of delivering the talk to and hopefully

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,249
you know some Q&A time we can have a

00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,649
little bit of back and forth talk about

00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:17,639
your specific struggles how many of you

00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:20,159
are working as website designers how

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:24,029
many of you are freelancing how many of

00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:26,999
you work for an agency how many people

00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:29,119
are the sole contacts for most of the

00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:31,949
customers that come into your business

00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:37,050
all right so that's a pretty good pretty

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:39,029
good spread here so as web designers we

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,249
like to focus on what we're building and

00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:42,629
not so much on managing what we're

00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:45,329
building we really like to get the work

00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:47,759
done we like to make our customers happy

00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:49,439
but we need to be sure that along the

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,939
way we are keeping things in bounds so

00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,149
that the project isn't spiraling out of

00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,199
control as in the example that I showed

00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:57,629
so I'm going to give you just a very

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,819
very basic overview of what project

00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,649
management is to start and then we'll

00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,139
get a little bit deeper into scope creep

00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:06,779
and controlling how your projects move

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,639
forward and keeping things in line so

00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,999
the first thing to understand about a

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:16,199
project is a project is a temporary

00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:18,360
endeavor it has a very set and defined

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,879
beginning point and it has a very set

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,189
defined end point so a project isn't a

00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,079
website that goes on and on and on and

00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,899
on and on and on and on and continually

00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,999
gets added to the project is the initial

00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,619
scope of work there's a starting point

00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:34,860
and there's a clearly defined end point

00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:37,409
when the project is complete and so

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,319
projects have three things that kind of

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:42,839
make up the quality of how the project

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,789
ends and that is the the cost how much

00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,760
you're gonna charge for your project the

00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:47,710
time how long it's

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,810
take you to complete the project and the

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,040
scope which is the full list of all of

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,930
the features all of the things that

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,850
you're going to do during this project

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,760
and all three of those things dictates

00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,290
the quality this project management

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,630
triangle we'll talk about a little bit

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:06,430
further down the road and so a manager

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,800
project management a manager is the

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,340
person who has the responsibility to

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,460
make decisions about a project the

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,340
manager of a project is the person who

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,610
is solely responsible for the success or

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:25,090
for the failure of a project so as the

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:30,040
project manager you are working with

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,840
your customers one on one to control the

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,150
cost of the project to control the scope

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,610
of the project to control the time of

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,950
the project so that you can end up with

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,930
a successful project now a successful

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,180
project might not just be a really great

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,270
looking website a successful project

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,920
might be the relationship that you end

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,770
your website build with your clients on

00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,600
so if you build a terrific website for

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,100
your customer but you're fighting so

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,470
much during the process that's the at

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,080
the end of the project you guys have a

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,750
sour relationship that may very well be

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,750
a failed project and so what I'm going

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,000
to help you do today is learn how to

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:11,440
keep your project on track and work

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,050
towards quality and success so back to

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,700
the project management triangle this

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,770
this is kind of out of the project

00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,620
management institute sort of a very

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,170
great way to look at how to keep the

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,690
quality of your project under control

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,340
so again the quality is in the inside of

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,840
the triangle and the quality of the

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,390
project is going to be dictated by the

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:35,770
time it takes you to complete the cost

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:38,200
and the scope and so the key is to keep

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,780
the triangle equilateral any time one

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,550
thing gives the other things have to

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,840
give along with the thing that you

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:49,900
changed so that the triangle doesn't get

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,960
out of proportion so here you see if we

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,270
increase the scope of a project without

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,310
increasing the cost or the time it takes

00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,410
to complete the quality is going to

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,690
suffer so if you add

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,230
to a project you need to make sure that

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:09,970
you are adding on the appropriate amount

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:11,829
of time and the appropriate cost so for

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,139
freelancers kind of a very practical

00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:15,670
approach to project management your job

00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,399
as a project manager is to make sure

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,019
that your projects are completed on time

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,850
your job is to make sure that they meet

00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:24,250
the agreed project scope that you talked

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,829
about with your customer and you need to

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,420
make sure that your projects cost what

00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:31,810
you agree to at the beginning of the

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,670
project and so you need to take a step

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,069
out so instead of going back to the

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,079
example that I gave earlier with the web

00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:39,670
designer are continually thinking oh

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,990
that form is so easy to build or oh

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,579
let's just add one more page because

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,560
it's simple for me to do when you're

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:46,329
acting as a project manager you need to

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,910
take a step out of your web design shoes

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:51,850
and stop thinking about how easy it is

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,920
to add certain things to a website but

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,019
think about the time and the cost

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,050
implement in applications that those

00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,970
will have on the overall product so your

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,189
job as a project manager is to stop

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:07,449
thinking like a web designer you need to

00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:09,160
change your minds shift as a project

00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:11,380
manager you are the person who is going

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,470
to keep your project leading you're the

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,910
one who is going to communicate with all

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,399
of the members that are involved in the

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,079
project you're going to balance

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,500
competing objectives has anyone ever

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,420
been in a room with a board of directors

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,699
who's working together on a project and

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,230
you have five different people on the

00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:31,660
board and they all have different ideas

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,480
so your job for the project manager is

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,370
to determine what is the goal what is

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,050
the initial outcome how do we balance

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,699
all of the different ideas that

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,730
everybody is bringing to the table and

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:45,149
agree on one decision to help move

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,149
forward

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,400
determine who the decision-maker is in

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,050
your board of directors if you're

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,520
working with four different people and

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,290
you come together in a group meeting and

00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,330
they have a bunch of ideas this is a

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,280
great time to interject and say hey okay

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,930
I hear all of you let's summarize all of

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,900
your ideas why don't the four of you

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,220
meet as a team and decide which one of

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,680
you is gonna be the decision maker on

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,240
the project so when you first start your

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,490
project especially if you're working

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,770
with multiple people make sure that you

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,390
determine one person on the client end

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,010
who is going to be delivering final

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:22,070
decisions to you and who's gonna be in

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,720
charge of making the calls of what

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,040
happens in the project it's okay if they

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,570
need to go back and consult with their

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,160
board but you don't need to be part of

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,280
that process and you need to make sure

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,320
that you are clear on who is allowed to

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,270
give you changes so that you don't end

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,650
up in a situation where four different

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,930
people are requesting for different

00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,990
things and you're just bending and doing

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,050
all of them or you could be adding on

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,000
cost and cost and cost to compete with

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,440
every single person's different ideas

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,720
and at the end of the project you come

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,310
back and nobody is clear who had the

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,110
authority to continually increase the

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,100
budget of this project so make sure that

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,310
when you're working with customers

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,960
there's one clear decision-maker

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,880
the other part of your job is

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,680
communication actually the biggest part

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,330
of a project manager's job is gonna be

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,310
communication making sure that everyone

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,640
is crystal clear about how the project

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,970
is flowing how things are on track and

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,280
also make sure that you keep all of the

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,380
different members who are working on the

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,150
board of directors or on the team you're

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,580
building a website for focus on the

00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,940
central goal what was the initial intent

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,590
of the project so some great skills to

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,080
have problem-solving is essential

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,640
communication like I said motivation as

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,100
a project manager you need to be

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,820
motivated to keep the project moving

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,230
oftentimes you may need to be a

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,490
cheerleader for your customers you may

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,680
need to help them keep the project

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,900
moving forward and let them know what

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,270
the next steps are leadership skills

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,470
absolutely important especially if

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,420
you're working with a team inside of

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,380
your organization but leadership skills

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,610
whether you work when you're working

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,050
with your customer are also going to

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,270
come in so you can help guide your

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,800
customer you can show them what they

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,960
need to provide to you you can

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,080
demonstrate how to keep the project

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,529
moving forward smoothly a negotiation

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,120
skill

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,430
you may have to get into a tough

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,279
situation or a tough conversation with a

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,139
customer where they want 10 team members

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,730
added to their website but you can't do

00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,949
that for free so you might need to

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,259
negotiate a cost and that's gonna

00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:16,610
obviously increase the time it takes you

00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:18,350
to complete the project as well so

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,059
you're gonna need to renegotiate the

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,279
time frame that you talked about at the

00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:25,009
beginning of the project and customer

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,050
service number one this is the the

00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:28,970
biggest thing that we focus on in in our

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,379
company is making sure that every step

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,199
of the way no matter how firm you're

00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,970
being with customers and how much you're

00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,370
you have to say no or you have to

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,499
increase the price do it with a smile

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,300
make sure that you are answering your

00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:43,970
phone make sure that you're providing

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,910
fast responsive customer service that is

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,170
going to speak speak dollar signs to

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,410
your customer they're going to be more

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,600
willing to work with you on terms if you

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:57,110
have great communication skills and

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,490
great customer service to back it up you

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,259
may also play some other roles you may

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,639
be involved in accounting if your

00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,779
customers call up and they want to know

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,920
where we're sitting with billing you may

00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,240
have to look up their account you may

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,350
have to tell them you know how much

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,699
money they owe you might have to send

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,040
out some invoices that's the project

00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:12,620
manager you very well could be acting as

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,569
a sales agent in the example where

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,220
someone wants to add a team section on

00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:18,139
you might have to upsell your customer

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,910
and that's a great thing don't be afraid

00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,500
to upsell as part of your project

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,259
management that's only more money for

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,480
your business and for you and you might

00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:28,490
be a hiring manager if you are working

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,959
with an internal team maybe you need to

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,309
bring on contractors maybe you need to

00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,040
bring on graphic designers maybe you

00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:36,379
need to bring on content writers or

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,360
perhaps to get your job done easier you

00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:40,069
need to purchase a specific plugin so

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,839
part of your job as a project manager

00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:43,639
could be making executive decisions on

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,860
what software gets purchased in what

00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,550
people you hand jobs over to to

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,839
efficiently complete the job you might

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,139
yeah the purchasing manner you manager

00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,790
you may need to buy software as well all

00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:58,309
right so this brings us to kind of the

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,019
the hearts of the conversation the talk

00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:01,249
in the other room at 9 o'clock was a

00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:03,019
little bit of a mentioned a little bit

00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:06,199
about scope creep is everybody here

00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:08,689
familiar with the term scope creep one

00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:11,300
then one person you want to explain what

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:14,120
scope creep is

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,520
I work in higher education so scope

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,220
reaches when my vice-president comes up

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,440
to me five times a day and asks for the

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,320
extra features after we've decided on

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,910
that seventeenth website you described

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,210
exactly yes

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:33,110
so scope creep is when a project starts

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:36,440
to creep up beyond what you originally

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,900
agreed to do and you know that scope

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,990
creep has already happened when it's

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:45,260
starting to cost your business more time

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:48,530
or more money than you originally

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,080
budgeted so the goal is the project

00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,330
manager the primary overarching goal as

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,880
a project manager is to mitigate scope

00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,980
creep so we're gonna talk about some

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,920
ways to do this and first and foremost

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,220
scope creep prevention starts with the

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,220
sale

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:09,590
so another hypothetical situation let's

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,690
say we've got a sales guy and we've got

00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,490
a customer and they have a really

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,460
friendly meeting and they're talking

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:20,540
about everything that the customer needs

00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:23,030
on your website and so the sales agent

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,680
leaves the conversation thinking oh you

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,300
know what she just needs a super simple

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,710
brochure marketing site a couple of

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,560
little design features maybe some

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,420
contact forms but the customer leaves

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,220
that meeting thinking oh I'm gonna get

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,080
an e-commerce site I'm gonna get

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,320
conditional logic farms I'm gonna get

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,890
team BIOS I'm gonna get all of these

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,330
fancy features because he told me that

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,730
their team was so good at making

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,610
websites and so I'm just gonna I'm just

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,260
gonna end up with an amazing product so

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,880
sales agent goes back to the developer

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,280
and says hey a developer here's a

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,670
project for you this is a super simple

00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,800
website project and the developer starts

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,650
working it's a website built connects

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,100
with the customer and finds out that

00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:08,720
know what the developer delivered was

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,910
not exactly what the customer was

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,100
expecting because the customer was

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,260
pretty sure the sales agent was clear

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,120
about her shopping cart and about her

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:21,130
team members and about the conditional

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,510
logic forms and now we have an issue

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,770
where there is a complete disconnect a

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,510
complete misunderstanding

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,270
this is where the quality suffers in the

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:32,450
relationship this is a great example of

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,640
when that triangle becomes equilateral

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,700
because the customers expectations on

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,760
scope were not the same as your

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,980
expectations and so we may have a really

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,810
awesome looking website but we ain't now

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,070
have a serious situation with our

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:53,690
customer and that I would I would call a

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:55,910
project fail so project management and

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,400
scope creep prevention starts with the

00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,900
sale when you are selling a project if

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,490
you have a team that does sales make

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,620
sure you're delivering a super

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,300
crystal-clear proposal make sure your

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,910
line I didn't mean line item in

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,610
everything in your proposal

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:13,550
how many website pages are you gonna

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,240
build out define what a website page is

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,280
for you

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,880
so in our company we say we're gonna

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:23,750
build out 15 website pages oh yeah we

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:27,200
define a page as 750 words and two or

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,670
three simply formatted photos my

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,230
favorite one of my favorite graphics

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:35,030
yeah you can have it good or fast but

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:40,340
not gonna be cheap you have a good and

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:41,720
cheap but it's not gonna be best define

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,160
if you're if you're building out contact

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,620
forms do they include conditional lodge

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,930
logic be super specific in your

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,550
proposals contact forums if you just say

00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,950
we're gonna put a generic contact form

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,110
on your page and you think that that's a

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,320
six field form and your customer thinks

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,990
it's an 80 page form that's that's a big

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,820
difference so define what does contact

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,890
form mean are you going to give them six

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,740
to 12 input fields are you going to give

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,510
them three conditional logic sections to

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,560
each of those conditional logic sections

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,090
have four input fields that change is it

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,090
going to be one page contact former is

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,500
going to be a multi-page contact form

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,690
are you building out products is it an

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,580
e-commerce website in my experience the

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,800
larger the website the more potential

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,210
there is for scope creep and the more

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,700
potential there is to lose money and

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,350
this is simply because as the project

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,870
gets bigger and bigger especially with

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,910
e-commerce it's it's it's not fun and

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,350
it's not as easy to define the specific

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,880
features that go into it so if you're

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,420
building ecommerce and part of your

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,950
contract

00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,320
is that you're gonna build out products

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,210
for your customers define exactly how

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,310
many products is included at your price

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,570
point define what a product looks like

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,990
how many pictures are gonna go on a

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,790
product how many variables are gonna go

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,440
do you sell t-shirts how do we want to

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,150
do different colors of t-shirts do we

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,210
want to do different sizes of t-shirts

00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:02,360
does a large green cost the same amount

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,070
as a small red these are things that you

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,450
need to spell out and then it's really

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,660
great if you can in your proposal

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:11,930
include a price per additional so that

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,310
your customer knows and is and is not

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,220
surprised when you come to them and say

00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:18,350
hey said fifty products but we're at

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,060
seventy-five that's that's 25 more than

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,190
and it was included and so you're

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,280
looking at X for your additional spend

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,780
on this is that okay now I'm not saying

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,550
you have to be a hundred percent super

00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,170
rigid it's always good to give a little

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:34,220
bit just make sure that you're not

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,720
giving so much that your customer that

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:39,380
you have to go back and backpedal and

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,990
fix the situation so you know fifty

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,370
products and they give you fifty one

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,810
there's yeah there's everything to argue

00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,520
that that's okay and that's going to

00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,990
blend back to your customer service

00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,720
experience as a project manager just

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,280
using a little bit of common sense

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,540
explain your process what we do in our

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,070
business is we hold a project kickoff

00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,710
meeting as soon as the project closes

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,780
where our project manager the sales guy

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,960
and the decision maker very important to

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,700
have the decision maker on the customer

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,710
end all get together they they talk

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,900
about the whole project they review the

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,310
proposal and they talk about how they

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,860
like to communicate some people like

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,500
phone calls some people like emails some

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,850
people like text messages make sure when

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,020
you have your project kickoff meeting

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,600
that you're all on the same page about

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,330
scope of work about communications and

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,070
set expectations if your customer owes

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,320
you 10 page of content before you get

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,210
started put a deadline on that tell them

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,580
when you need it by explain to them that

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,450
you cannot continue with your process

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,700
until you have deliverables from them

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,690
likewise set expectations for yourself

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,150
let them know how frequently you're

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,920
going to be delivering let them know how

00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,090
they should expect to hear from you let

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,680
them know when you're going to get

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,570
updates and let them know what your

00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,130
billing schedule looks like so that

00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,050
everybody is crystal clear from the

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,530
beginning how your process works and how

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,810
the prod

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:58,910
we'll move forward identify milestones

00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,920
so when we start a new project typically

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,840
what we give our customers is a timeline

00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,610
which is an overarching sheet of what

00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,170
their entire project looks like and it

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,430
starts with the project kickoff meeting

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,840
and we have the date on there and then

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,060
we have a place for them to initial off

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,430
at the end of the meeting following that

00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:16,340
we need content so that's one of the

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:19,610
milestones and we will put a date that

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,890
it's due by the the timeline can be can

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,450
change as it goes you can you know set

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,760
the date for the next deliverable and

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,770
then put expectations for how long it'll

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,070
take you to turn around after you

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,390
receive from your customer what order

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,710
two things need to be completed in if

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,390
you need content before you can build

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,220
out a website design make sure that your

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,630
customer sees that have it in print have

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,180
it on a PDF have it on a website

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,800
somewhere so they can visually see the

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,570
order that their project is going to be

00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,370
completed in this will help them stay on

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,470
track and this is also you stay on track

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,510
and organize your projects so that you

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,730
can see as you go down the timeline

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:55,070
where you're falling at also stick to

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,660
your timeline once a customer signs off

00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,520
on something on their timeline they

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,110
don't get to go back and make changes if

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,460
they go back and make changes that's a

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,190
change of scope that's a change of your

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:08,270
project that should fall under billable

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,830
time back to communication your most

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,850
important job as a project manager make

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,550
sure you're keeping those lines of

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,800
communication open find out I saw this

00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,920
earlier who the primary contact is find

00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,450
out who the decision maker is and most

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,920
importantly make sure you're keeping a

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,140
record of all communications you have

00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,670
it's very easy to get on the phone with

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,740
a customer or meet with someone face to

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,960
face and have a good long conversation

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,020
about what they're expecting and what

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,870
you're going to do and then go back and

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,430
do it only to find out that information

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,140
was taken a different way from the

00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,720
customer so after an in-person meeting

00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:44,900
after a phone call always send a

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,990
follow-up email outlining what you

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,850
talked about outlining the scope of work

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,370
outlining the price the time it's going

00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:55,160
to take this way you're all on the same

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,170
page before you start and if anything

00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,120
changes moving forward or expectations

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:02,810
change you have written documentation to

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,120
refer to also make sure that different

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,640
team members are not promising

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,870
different things to the same customer we

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,150
have run into this situation before

00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,530
where a sales guy gets on the phone with

00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,750
a customer and says oh yeah we'll go

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,490
ahead and do that for you and then the

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,900
project manager is on the phone and says

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,940
oh yeah we're gonna do it this way and

00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,350
then they get the developer on the phone

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,930
and the developer says oh actually we're

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,760
gonna do it this way and now we've got a

00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,370
customer who's been told three different

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,420
things by three different people now

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,710
that's cool if you want to have your

00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,660
developers talk directly with your

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,430
customers that can that can be super

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,260
advantageous sometimes it's really hard

00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,700
to get across an idea or to explain a

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,800
concept as a project manager

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,590
maybe you just need your tech officer to

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,390
do it if that happens again make sure

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,400
that written communication is follow it

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,020
up make sure that you are sending an

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,970
email or that your developer is sending

00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,800
an email and copy the project manager

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,929
copy the customer on that email

00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,510
hey great phone call this is what was

00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:58,670
said this is how we're move forward this

00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,970
is how it's going to affect your project

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:05,600
an address red flags super quickly if

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,820
you're if your project starts to get

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,250
into scope creep if you if your customer

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,870
starts expecting more make sure that you

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,220
nip it in the bud as soon as you

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,770
possibly can this will set expectations

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,240
moving forward if you make it clear to

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,890
your customer right away when something

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,200
goes out of scope they'll be less likely

00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,490
to continually pile on things that are

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,200
out of scope as the project moves

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,750
forward and they'll know how you react

00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,179
to it they'll be able to kind of gauge

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,530
moving forward how the project is going

00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:36,860
to change with their expectations

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:38,840
revisit the original goal so many times

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,360
we've been halfway through a project

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,610
when the customer says oh we should

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,080
start selling well what was the original

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,390
goal of your project you wanted to get

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,970
more phone calls yeah but maybe we

00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,110
should just sell our products online

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,850
let's take a step back here how do you

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,080
sell what's your best sales method you

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,400
you told us at the beginning of the

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,650
project that phone calls was the

00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,970
original goal so always go back to that

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,980
if you're having an issue with scope

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,720
creep always pull out the original goal

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,700
of the project why were we doing this in

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,830
the first place is what you're going to

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,890
do is what you're wanting to add ongoing

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:14,650
to accomplish your goal is it going to

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,650
make things muddy can we add it later

00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,880
if we add on e-commerce to your website

00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,290
how's that going to affect your deadline

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,120
you have a really big trade show coming

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,740
up in two months you wanted to get your

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,000
new website up before your tradeshow if

00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:31,180
we add on e-commerce are we gonna meet

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,950
that deadline and keep track of scope

00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,630
changes we have a change order form

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,850
that's on our website that people fill

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,320
out depending on the change order

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,660
requests there may be a cost associated

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,490
with it which we make them pay at the

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,630
time that they fill out the form so if

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,140
your customer does want to add their

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,910
team BIOS onto the website that's great

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,260
don't be afraid to upsell but make sure

00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,910
you're recording it and make sure that

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,860
they're signing off on it and if it is

00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,740
I'm gonna incur additional costs make

00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:59,350
sure that either they put a deposit to

00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,990
where that or somewhere sign to agree

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,760
that they will meet the additional cost

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,070
if it's going to delay the launch of the

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,330
project make sure that they're clear

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,040
that you're clear about that and that

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,770
they understand and that they accept

00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,240
those terms so maybe adding on three

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,570
more pages isn't going to change the

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,660
cost but maybe it's gonna push launch

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:23,310
date back a week is that okay does your

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:25,480
customer agree to those terms and

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,270
finally when a project is complete

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,400
follow-up ask questions get genuine

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,350
feedback it is so much easier to get

00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,510
feedback from your customers and get

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,450
reviews as soon as the project is done

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:40,690
than it is to come back and - two or

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,790
three months later ask how you did how

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:47,980
did this project flow for you what could

00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:50,650
I have done better what expectations did

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,570
you have that weren't met did I go above

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,860
and beyond anywhere getting feedback

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,030
from your customers will help you move

00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,740
forward will help you better your

00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:00,510
process will help you change how you

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,510
handle your project management

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,990
all right so any questions so far so I'm

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,580
gonna talk a little bit about tools oh

00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:17,580
yeah yeah phone time do we build for

00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,120
phone time so typically we so the

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,910
question was do we build for phone time

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,830
no unless it falls into consulting time

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,539
about something that wasn't originally

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,030
included so when we put together

00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,070
proposals if it's an active client that

00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:35,880
we're working with we typically include

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:38,880
project management time in the cost so

00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,409
we average you know the average project

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,200
that takes us a month to complete is

00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:44,909
going to take 20 hours of project

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,900
management time for example project

00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:47,669
management time is going to include

00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,820
those phone calls project management

00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:52,230
time is going to include organizing

00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:56,220
collecting information emailing back and

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:58,350
forth if you set your proposal structure

00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,750
up correctly oftentimes when we're doing

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,090
custom builds we will include a one-hour

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,490
consultation with a designer or we will

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:08,700
include a 45-minute review with the

00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,650
project manager on the phone and so for

00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,539
the larger projects we oftentimes will

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:16,530
dictate how much time is included and

00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:18,150
then above that if it if it really gets

00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:20,100
out of control then yeah we'll let them

00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,960
know you know what we've gone an hour

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,760
past the time that was allotted at this

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,690
point we're falling into consulting time

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,159
if it's on new add-ons you can handle

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,610
that either by saying you know what this

00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,190
is

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,450
this may fall into a Phase two this may

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,280
be something that we consult about later

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,570
or you may send them back to sales and

00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,110
then however you handle your sales

00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,309
process and billing for that that ain't

00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,150
your question okay

00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:44,150
yes

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:55,050
our project in an hour yeah so the

00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,870
question is how do you build by project

00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:00,630
or our release so we typically have will

00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:03,300
we put on a proposal with a minimum

00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:06,780
scope of work and the cost on that is a

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,310
prize a per project invoice for a new

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,610
project for example for a full new

00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:13,650
development project and that price will

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,730
spell out things like how much project

00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,890
management time and one-on-one

00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,050
communication time they get it'll spell

00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:21,000
out you know how many design revisions

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,640
they get it will spell out development

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,890
features and then anything above and

00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,830
beyond that either falls into hourly if

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:31,020
it's minor updates or changes or it will

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,210
be rolled over into another project and

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,580
so the way that we typically gauge it is

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:38,100
if it's gonna take us less than three or

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,190
four hours to complete we will just

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,960
invoice hourly for making additional

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,280
changes and going above and beyond we'll

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,770
have them fill out a change order form

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,420
for additional hourly work and then

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,130
they'll agree to the hourly cost and

00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,630
oftentimes that change our order will

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,640
say not to exceed four hours of

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,510
additional work but if it's going to

00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,010
take more time and it's going to

00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,780
severely impact the timeline of the

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:00,870
project will oftentimes fill it out as a

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:04,200
new add-on proposal and at that point

00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:07,500
then yes it's project based so I guess

00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:15,390
the answer is it really depends on what

00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:17,670
what exactly the add-on is initially yes

00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:23,820
we don't invoice hourly because it's

00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:25,230
very very hard to calculate everything

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,870
that goes into a project on an hourly

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,820
basis because we're also accounting for

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,890
overhead I mean we have an office we

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,140
have computers we have an electric bill

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:37,470
we have the sales time that went into

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,090
selling it's you know so did it take a

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,770
month to close a sale does it take two

00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,330
months to close the sale so we look at

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,430
all of those factors while we're

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:48,570
determining a product price oftentimes

00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:50,850
the project price can be defended can be

00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,360
reflected by a skill level you know so a

00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:56,640
very simple five page marketing website

00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,810
even if it takes our developers less

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,779
time to complete a 5 page membership

00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:05,649
website the skill

00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:07,090
there is quite a bit higher and so you

00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,320
need to kind of consider in a lot of

00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,289
different factors when you're when

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,080
you're pricing on projects our leave you

00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:15,609
know you you can sit down and straight

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,989
calculate out how many hours it's gonna

00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:18,759
take and I would recommend that you do

00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:21,700
that because it will give you a good

00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:23,320
idea of how long it's taking you to

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,149
complete projects and how much you're

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,590
actually making per hour but you also

00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:28,239
need to calculate how much you actually

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,279
need to make per hour to keep the

00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:36,599
business running so there's a lot that

00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:36,599
goes into it yeah yes

00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:47,710
so revisit the original goal ask why why

00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:53,499
did we decide to do this back to numbers

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:56,200
five and six and then step six six was

00:32:53,499 --> 00:33:04,899
scope changes so for this we have a

00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:06,429
change order form yeah yes I do and

00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:15,789
it'll be at the end yes the link to the

00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:17,619
slides will be at the end potentially

00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:18,820
see me afterwards we might be able to I

00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:22,419
might be able to show you a few things

00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:24,609
yeah possibly I do want to talk a little

00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,769
bit about tools but because you all are

00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:28,359
WordPress users and you might be web

00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:29,559
designers or web developers I would

00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,009
encourage you to use the tools that you

00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:34,419
have at hand already change orders we

00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:37,419
use gravity forms for change orders

00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:40,059
there is a signature implementation that

00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:42,999
you can add on to gravity forms you can

00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:44,649
add payment on to gravity forms and it

00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,529
looks super professional when you send

00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:49,149
your customers to a page on your website

00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:50,830
with their change orders spelled out and

00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:53,979
their price there and they can just sign

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:56,320
online it's also going to add value to

00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:57,669
your business and it's gonna validate

00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,619
you as a web designer if you're

00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:03,309
utilizing the tools that you have at

00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:06,279
hand for timelines we utilize page

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:07,989
builders great way if you if you use

00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,639
even Gutenberg blocks maybe you have a

00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:11,169
timeline block and you duplicate that

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,240
block over and over and over and over

00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:15,410
and you put every milestone along the

00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,700
way so your customers can see

00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:19,190
a visual we actually have an entire

00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,650
website dedicated to project management

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,410
and sales where we have home all of this

00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:27,170
stuff so it's not indexed so people can

00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:30,290
reference it and we deliver our

00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:32,930
proposals we deliver scopes of work via

00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:35,660
the web as well super easy to create a

00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:38,150
page in WordPress type up your proposal

00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,980
type up your scope of work embed a

00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,510
gravity form at the bottom of it have

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,880
your customer sign off on the scope of

00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,680
work so one of the advantages that we

00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,840
have as website developers is we have

00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,000
access to these tools and we know how to

00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,350
use these tools so don't be afraid to

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,170
use the tools that you're using for your

00:34:51,350 --> 00:35:00,770
customers for your own business to help

00:34:54,170 --> 00:35:03,380
you with your project management yeah so

00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:06,440
there's a lot of different in terms of

00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,420
managing your financials there are a lot

00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,010
yeah harvest fresh books there are a lot

00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,670
of different invoicing software that you

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,410
can use whether or not you know that

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:20,150
that goes along with project

00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:21,350
management's I would I guess I would

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,020
recommend using a tool that you already

00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:49,910
have rather than creating it from the

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:51,800
ground up yes yeah so the comment was

00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,480
that it's really great if you're

00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,640
charging hourly to be able to track all

00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,800
of your time so yeah there are a lot of

00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,900
third-party applications that do time

00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,430
tracking that integrate time tracking

00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,900
with task management I'm going to talk a

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,610
little bit I have just a flute a few

00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,090
different tools that I've used in the

00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:13,190
past specifically for project management

00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:17,060
so if anyone's heard of zapier which

00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:19,070
allows different programs to be super

00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,720
integrated with each other so there are

00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,580
a lot of time tracking harvest I think

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,780
is one time tracking option that will

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,880
integrate with slack that will integrate

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,710
with asana or base camps so if you use

00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,540
any tools for project management and you

00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,850
want to bring time tracking into that or

00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:35,680
you want to bring billing into that you

00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:38,050
can using api's through zapier connect

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,930
your different tools to work together so

00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:44,420
we have used all of these in the past

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:46,940
asana is a great task management

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,440
software platform if you'd like to make

00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,750
lists if you'd like to check things off

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,290
your list asana is great i have an

00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:56,630
overview here when we use this on in the

00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,430
past we would create a template for the

00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,280
flow of a project and the steps that go

00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:03,560
along every section every way through

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,050
the project and you can just duplicate

00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,510
that template and modify it for every

00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:11,570
customer you take on for website go live

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:14,210
checklist get the DNS information do a

00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,980
page speed check change the a record

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,510
check for broken links all of the things

00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,820
that you do in your go live process

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:23,000
that's a great asana is a great tool to

00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,320
use to duplicate that and check off

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,610
things as you go so you don't miss

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,350
something ah Trello is very similar to

00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,580
asana but it's more board based where

00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,830
you can have different projects it gives

00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,910
you sort of an at-a-glance view of all

00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,770
over the different projects that you're

00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,390
working on the nice thing with the sauna

00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,490
and Trello is if you want to you can

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,560
give your customers permission to access

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:46,460
their project so they can see where you

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,320
are in the workflow another project

00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,720
management tools similar is Basecamp

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,460
Basecamp used to be super poppy

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,550
in the tech industry there are quite a

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,800
few other alternatives now so depending

00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,450
on you know what what level your

00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,140
company's at asana has a free version

00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:05,240
for up to I think eight users and a

00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,970
certain number of projects Trello and

00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:12,020
Basecamp are paid software project

00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:14,050
management tools slack is free for up to

00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,490
a certain number of users we use slack

00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,230
every day even though we work together

00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,940
in a co-located office most of our

00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,369
communication is on slack just so that

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:25,220
there's written communication we use

00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,720
slack to post updates about every

00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,190
project so we have a different channel

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,109
in slack for every project that we're

00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:33,680
working on and the full proposal goes up

00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:35,119
in their recap of conversations on the

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,130
phone with a customer goes in there so

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,790
that the developers are on the same page

00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:42,800
as the project manager more than

00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:45,880
anything we use Google Drive and Google

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,160
Docs for project management timesheet or

00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,630
timelines change orders proposals those

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,470
types of things if you decide not to use

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:58,070
your website and gravity forms or page

00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:00,530
builders to build out some of these

00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,880
things you can use Google sheets the

00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,410
nice thing about Google Drive is you can

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,240
create shared folders for your customers

00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,700
to upload their photos their logos their

00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,190
assets you can put notes in there for

00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,140
your customers as well we will utilize

00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,210
Google Docs very frequently when we're

00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,339
working on website edits and changes so

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,200
we can have multiple people working

00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:19,550
through the changes and crossing them

00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,200
out or highlighting the changes in

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,910
different colors that they're going to

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,920
work on so that our entire team is kind

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:29,839
of on the same page about who's handling

00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:31,190
what and yeah that's kind of what I have

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,540
we have about five minutes for questions

00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:40,940
and my slides as someone asked for is at

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:44,080
iceberg web design comm /wc SCV any

00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,080
further questions yes

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:56,349
Google harvesting so the question is how

00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:57,999
worried are you about some of these

00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,490
tools harvesting the information that

00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:02,710
you put up I guess my answer is a little

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,930
bit I would recommend that you never put

00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:08,880
sensitive data such as passwords into

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:11,289
your project management tools however

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,200
we're not we're not typically working

00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:15,940
with super sensitive data in these tools

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,039
I mean a lot of it is you know content

00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,930
that's going on a marketing page if a

00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:23,109
customer has an NDA that we need to sign

00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:26,559
for something we likely wouldn't publish

00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:28,900
that in one of these channels depending

00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,200
on you know what the what what exactly

00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,309
it is if it's financial information

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,930
payments information anything like that

00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:36,369
you yeah you definitely don't want to be

00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,069
publishing credit card numbers in

00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:40,809
project management tools you'll you want

00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:45,009
to use different methods to communicate

00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:46,420
those lost pass one pass one pass is a

00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,799
great service where you can just share

00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,450
your patch share passwords with your

00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:52,809
customers without actually getting their

00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,670
passwords so did encrypts it you can use

00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:57,489
Virtual Private Networks if you want to

00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,450
if you're on open Wi-Fi so if you're

00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,710
working in a coffee shop and you're

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,569
concerned about it there are a number of

00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,970
DPN apps that you can install on your

00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:10,799
computer or your phone to encrypt data

00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:10,799
that passes through the Wi-Fi yes Rek

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,819

00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,209
[Music]

00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:53,869
great comment any other questions

00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:58,910
yes I've been so I've been running my

00:41:53,869 --> 00:42:02,029
own company for some time now about four

00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:04,759
years but I've been struggling really

00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:08,930
hard to actually to actually be able to

00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:10,609
fill at a fixed price this I've already

00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:13,099
shot myself in the foot every single

00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:15,109
time and I mean of course like you know

00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:17,299
that even though the mouth is growing

00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:19,160
it's growing but I'm so struggling like

00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:22,339
everything that you mentioned was like

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:29,329
I'm doing everything wrong I am in the

00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:33,680
right place for that it's so hard so you

00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:36,619
only I started to do freelance again and

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,180
doing I'm doing our lead and I feel so

00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:40,640
much better like I'm seeing paper

00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,979
whatever what I feel I'm worried but yet

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,479
like I want to be able to get to the

00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:49,940
point where I can actually like so like

00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:53,359
websites web applications to clients and

00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,459
you know deliver everything to the point

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,499
where it's like clients happy I'm happy

00:42:55,459 --> 00:43:00,949
I'm making money you know everyone's

00:42:57,499 --> 00:43:03,559
making money right but it's such a

00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:05,329
struggle um I'm just like I'm like doing

00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:07,369
both I'm freelancing and running a

00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:09,380
company cuz I just haven't gotten that

00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:11,180
yet got in to the point where I can feel

00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,859
good and you know get it get it up and

00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:20,180
running no I guess maybe the question is

00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:22,519
like like how how can you securely start

00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,989
with say is small whether is yourself or

00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:26,630
maybe this small team kind of growing

00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:29,930
from zero to you know to where you are

00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:34,309
how do we transition from basically like

00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:38,150
the hourly thinking but also using a

00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:40,609
certain thing certain methods to

00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,740
actually get out of that like that

00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:47,500
hourly zone and that and

00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:50,589
right so for the video the comment was

00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,329
on the struggle going from hourly rates

00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:54,369
to fixed rates especially as your team

00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:57,190
is growing and how to kind of overcome

00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:58,569
as you're growing your team charging on

00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,069
an hourly basis to charging on a per

00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:04,660
project base and how to increase that

00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:05,980
overtime so I I have a whole talk that

00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,619
I've delivered before on growing from a

00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,599
freelancer into an agency and I'd love

00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:12,880
to chat with anybody about that you know

00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:13,930
outside of outside of this room later at

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,760
the conference if you're interested in

00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:17,109
that I mean the short answer is as soon

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,880
as I started hiring people I doubled

00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:20,950
prices and then a couple years later you

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,720
know we did it again what you need to

00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,849
look at when you're setting your project

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,910
price a little bit of competitive

00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:29,859
analysis is helpful and obviously

00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,720
location is going to depend greatly on

00:44:29,859 --> 00:44:32,980
you know what you're going to charge but

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,450
look at your whole overhead how much

00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,280
money do you want to make how much money

00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,569
are you putting into your office how

00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,700
much money are you putting into your

00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:41,140
staffing how much insurance you have and

00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,660
how many projects do you think you're

00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:46,690
going to sell this year and so from a

00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,280
very very broad broad overview if you

00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:52,630
think you can sell two projects a month

00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:54,040
and you need $100,000 to live then

00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:58,000
that's a hundred thousand divided by 24

00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:02,260
per project right as kind of a base

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,810
minimum to gauge project pricing now

00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,280
obviously you know if you think you're

00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,810
gonna sell a bunch of really complex

00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,579
projects and a bunch of smaller projects

00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:11,020
that kind of changes up the numbers but

00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:12,550
take a step back from the our league

00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:16,540
thinking and think of it on a broader

00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:18,460
sense of how much you need to keep your

00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,010
business running and to keep your life

00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,660
stable and then as you grow think about

00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,890
what just growth look like how do you

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,210
want to change your prices and your

00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,980
price structure so that you can then

00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,020
meet the demands of your growing staff

00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:35,339
your growing operations and hopefully an

00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:35,339
increased salary for you as well yes oh

00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:48,190
contract addressing the issue yes last

00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:50,080
question here I'll answer very quickly

00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,700
the question was do you clue to include

00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,980
con language in your contract for

00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:57,369
addressing scope changes and scope big

00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:59,650
increases yes absolutely in my contract

00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:01,119
in our contracts it very clearly states

00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:02,140
that you've agreed to the scope of work

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,330
that you've signed up to on your

00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,730
proposal so customers signs a proposal

00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:08,920
scope of work and they sign a contract

00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,200
and then it does outline the change

00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,680
order process we also have a project

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,940
delay fee and process that is also

00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,310
outlined in the contract so yeah you

00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:20,320
need to make sure that the parts of your

00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,970
process that you may get pushback on

00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,670
from customers are clearly outlined in

00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:27,220
your contracts and that's a completely

00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,930
different subject but alright I think

00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,609
we're out of time I will be available

00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,960
and around for the rest of the weekend

00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:33,060
so thank you all very much for attending

00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:39,380
I

00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:39,380
