WordPress business owners have a lot to lose in the event of a successful cyberattack, and security awareness is at an all-time high as companies work to improve their security posture before the worst can happen. This is a good thing, of course, since an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
However, many of those same companies don’t have a solid plan of action for when the worst does happen. A lack of a plan in the wake of an attack will delay response, increase downtime, and ultimately cost more money.
In this talk, Mikey Veenstra will discuss the elements of incident response planning that many business owners fail to address. Whether your business needs a full manual of contingency plans or just a folder with some phone numbers in it, you’ll leave ready to draw up a solid guideline to follow in the event that something goes wrong.
