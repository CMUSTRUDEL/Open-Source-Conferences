Title: Mikey Veenstra: WordPress Incident Response: How Planning for the Worst Protects Your Site Today
Publication date: 2019-09-07
Playlist: WordCamp Santa Clarita 2019
Description: 
	April 6, 2019, 10 am Horseshoe Ranch Room, University Center, College of the Canyons —
WordPress business owners have a lot to lose in the event of a successful cyberattack, and security awareness is at an all-time high as companies work to improve their security posture before the worst can happen. This is a good thing, of course, since an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
However, many of those same companies don’t have a solid plan of action for when the worst does happen. A lack of a plan in the wake of an attack will delay response, increase downtime, and ultimately cost more money.
In this talk, Mikey Veenstra will discuss the elements of incident response planning that many business owners fail to address. Whether your business needs a full manual of contingency plans or just a folder with some phone numbers in it, you’ll leave ready to draw up a solid guideline to follow in the event that something goes wrong.

cool how's everybody doing today

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,349
yeah it's after lunch the second day of

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,380
WordCamp I'm astonished any of you er in

00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:29,519
here but I'm very glad actually there

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,739
the room kind of filled up and I'm

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,170
excited about that apparently this is a

00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,350
talk some people are interested in which

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,339
is a good spot for me to be and I'm glad

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,989
you guys are here so we're gonna be

00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:42,720
talking about Incident Response with

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,210
WordPress on how planning for the worst

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,339
can help secure your site today we're

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,659
gonna be looking at some steps that you

00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,089
can take and some things that you can

00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:53,250
keep in mind now before something bad

00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:56,250
happens to make it easier to recover

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,769
when something bad does happen my name

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,259
is Mikey I'm a threat analyst at

00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,900
wordfence my job involves researching

00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,610
what the baddies are up to and building

00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,840
firewall rules to stop them from doing

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,790
other bad things I am an ethical hacker

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,869
so I'd do penetration testing exercises

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,360
and basically a hacker who uses their

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,770
powers for good I'm also a lock sport

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,819
hobbyist so I pick locks for fun and

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,920
according to - I am the world's greatest

00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,549
dad but that is disputed by probably

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,719
some people in this very room and you

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,590
can follow me on twitter at hey it's

00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:37,259
Mikey B so the first thing that I want

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,590
to cover is this this thought that I

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,810
don't need an incident response plan and

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,049
I want to illustrate this with some

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,749
examples with a fire escape plan so you

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,429
know why bother having a plan to get get

00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:52,139
out of this building in the event of a

00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:54,329
fire right we don't need that kind of

00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:58,319
plan because we don't start fires do we

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,899
we know better and and we see that kind

00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,740
of response from developers and people

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,420
building WordPress websites where we

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,799
don't really think too hard about what

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,200
happens in the event of a security

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,800
incident because we just don't think

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,940
we're ever going to create one another

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,709
reason we wouldn't need a fire escape

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,950
plan is because we've got sprinklers in

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,450
the building any fire gets detected some

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,610
water rains down from the ceiling

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,010
everything's instantly better nothing

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,260
gets worse right you see that kind of

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,700
attitude when we have malware scanners

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,830
on our

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,810
sites that are detecting things and then

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,879
automatically cleaning them up and we we

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,349
think it's all good because the

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,830
sprinklers activated and put out that

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,280
one fire but in reality how did it get

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,150
there

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,700
did it get everything that sort of thing

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,580
we also don't need a fire escape plan

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,140
because we had an inspection done you

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,910
see this with with places where there's

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,650
you know PCI compliance or something

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,090
where you know people have taken a look

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,769
yeah we've we've checked all the boxes

00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,989
on their checklist and they're

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,670
reasonably satisfied you know the fire

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:03,890
marshal came through gave us a thumbs up

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,959
and I personally think that's guarantee

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:13,069
that no fire will ever occur in this

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:15,829
building so we do we need a fire escape

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,799
plan because things can go wrong and

00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:25,069
they often do which is why companies

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:26,690
like mine exist so in this talk we're

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,269
going to be covering guidelines from

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,030
NIST the National Institute of Standards

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,209
and Technology they are the ones

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,489
publishing things like the rules for

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,190
password strength and things like that

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,680
used by the federal government you could

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,989
ignore this talk and go read the 79 page

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,970
spec document if you really want I don't

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:49,340
think you do it's actually not a

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,090
terrible read but this is probably a

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,769
little bit more easily crunched and we

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,359
do kind of I have to move fast because

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,590
there's a lot to cover in this I'm sorry

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,590
if I'm rushing through stuff I'll make

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,329
the slides available so our goals with

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,739
incident response and with security in

00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:08,630
general is to protect our CIA CIA is an

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:13,130
industry term for confidentiality

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,709
integrity and availability and these are

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,419
sort of straightforward sort of not so

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,950
confidentiality is keeping private data

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,979
out of the hands of people who don't

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,410
need to have it this may be company

00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,970
secrets or something as simple as your

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,310
password is something you want to keep

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,770
confidential this could also be user

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,270
data or user information of your clients

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,800
or people visiting your site and things

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:39,890
like that integrity refers to making

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,810
sure that what we're doing is that it

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,430
has integrity so this is things like

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,740
making sure

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,140
content on my website says what I want

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,360
it to all the scripts that my website

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,220
loads for its visitors are doing what I

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,550
want them to and that nothing has

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,310
damaged the integrity of that process if

00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,140
we see things where a JavaScript

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,480
injection has taken place and so now

00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,890
different code is running on the front

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,450
of my site causing redirects or

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,250
something like that you know maybe

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,930
they're not taking out our users data or

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,760
anything like that but it is harming the

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,950
integrity of my site and that's

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,790
something I want to avoid and then

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,790
availability is just is it up are my

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,790
services available for people to make

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,280
use of or reliably access so if

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,500
something like a DDoS event prevents my

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,460
site from loading that has damaged my

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,710
sites availability so everything with

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,330
with security is going to be preventing

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,330
any negative impact to these three

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,650
things there are competing models but

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,450
some of them have as many as six or

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,850
seven little elements that are all sort

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,100
of basically the same thing so this is a

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,810
good solid foundation if you're new to

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:52,030
Incident Response and this sort of thing

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,830
the difference between an event and an

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,570
incident is one that we want to kind of

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,540
keep our thumb on for the duration of

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,000
this talk the dictionary while the nist

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,160
dictionary definition of an event is an

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,950
observable occurrence in a system or

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,500
network this is gonna be things like one

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,530
hit to your website or one email sent or

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,110
received or one blocked thing from your

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,530
firewall something like that an incident

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,830
is when one or more events combined and

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,900
caused a negative impact to your CIA so

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,270
this is when a DDoS crash is a server

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,170
versus this is just a single web traffic

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,910
event when a vulnerability exploit works

00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,160
instead of being blocked that is an

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,750
incident as opposed to if it's blocked

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,990
that's not an incident that's business

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,760
as usual or something like a successful

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,980
phishing attempt somebody sent you an

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,800
email or somebody that uses your site

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,010
and it worked that's a security incident

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,950
[Applause]

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:53,440
and before we start the plan itself we

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,790
want to check a couple of these boxes we

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,730
need to make sure we know who's in

00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:00,490
charge of this process if it's just you

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,850
there then Congrats that's kind of the

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,410
de facto you but if you've got a team or

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,570
something you want somebody to be in

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,820
charge of this process we'll talk in a

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,170
little bit about the values of going

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,500
third party for the incident response

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,420
process but you still want somebody on

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,580
your team to be the point of contact for

00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,290
that somebody needs to be wrangling all

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,510
of this and coordinating it to make sure

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,430
that everything goes smoothly and that

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,480
you can facilitate any communication

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,700
between all relevant parties they need

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,350
to have management support so again if

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,080
it's just a one person thing then that's

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,310
super easy but if not you need to make

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,770
sure that whoever's in charge of this

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,930
has the authority to actually do what

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,520
they need to so they need to be able to

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,340
assign roles to other people in your

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,810
organization they need to be able to

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,360
contact outside parties be it your

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,729
outside incident response team law

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,310
enforcement your legal team anything

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,260
like that you don't like the last thing

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,870
that you want this incident handler to

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,350
do is need to ask for permission to save

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,150
your life and the authority to actually

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,919
test these plans and run drills and

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,479
things like that because we don't know

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,600
if these plans work until we've actually

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:12,370
tested them and then you want to agree

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,710
with everybody involved on how strict

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,690
this plan should be do we want a nice

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,180
rigid policy where everything has to be

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,820
exactly by the book or can we get away

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,150
with a set of more loose guidelines and

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,440
just some some rules to follow without

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:32,140
conscripted every little bit that needs

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,700
to be done and then communication at all

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,500
points during the incident response

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,180
process you need to be communicating

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,770
communicating with your incident

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,810
response team communicating with your

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:44,950
users with law enforcement if necessary

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,560
keeping your mouth shut about this kind

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,950
of thing is uniformly bad I understand

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,570
that there's like sensitive data and

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,920
company secrets they happen and you

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,060
don't want to just rattle that off to

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,810
everybody involved but you want to be as

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,360
open as you

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,370
can be so that it means informing your

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,800
users if something has happened there's

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,900
regulations like gdpr that force you to

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,820
do this sort of thing other

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,010
organizations might want to know so

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,740
people like like my team at wordfence

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,990
if your site was attacked by something

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,460
that we haven't seen before I really

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,730
want to know about it so I can stop

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,810
other people from having that same fate

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,400
and then you want to make sure that you

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,650
can clearly communicate with your

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,200
incident response team before an

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,660
incident actually happens the last thing

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,130
that you want is to send my team and

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,870
email and then find out that you've had

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,610
the wrong one and have to go and figure

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:42,730
that out in the middle of an otherwise

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:44,740
terrible incident this is NIST's actual

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,070
diagram of the incident response

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,390
lifecycle and this is kind of the

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,380
framework for the rest of this talk

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,040
we're going to be going over these

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,740
different steps this is a cycle that you

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,570
are always in right now assuming nothing

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,970
bad is actively happening to your site

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,529
every one of you are in the preparation

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,570
stage because we're learning we're

00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:06,120
working on improving things you are

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,580
going to remain in preparation

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,790
indefinitely hopefully forever until you

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,290
detect something when you detect

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,390
something then you want to analyze it

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:20,370
once you've analyzed it we want to move

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:23,530
to containment eradication and recovery

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,000
and then that's a bit of a loop there

00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,910
while we make sure that everything is

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,339
done and then when it's over we want to

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,860
have some activity after the incident is

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,690
over sort of a post a post-mortem period

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,450
if you will before we loop back around

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:41,350
and go back to our preparation holding

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,670
phase which is the first one we're going

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,760
to talk about yay

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,530
so this preparation stage is where we

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,910
want to make sure that your team has all

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,750
the tools that they need to be

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,910
successful so tools in this case mean

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,790
things like literal software tools like

00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,320
analytical tools and log aggregators and

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,270
things like that

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,240
this also means just simple things like

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,459
documentation if your incident response

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,589
team needs to ask you about every little

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,920
thing and whether it needs to be there

00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:12,410
and why it's there and how it

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,450
works that is going to markedly slow

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,670
them down when they could just be

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,700
reading documentation to teach

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,829
themselves all of this reporting tools

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,980
for third parties to inform you of stuff

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:28,519
so if you have a user who sees your

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,930
website has been defaced do you want to

00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,949
you want them to have a way to tell you

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,350
about that sometimes Twitter DM is all I

00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:38,389
end up having to the ability to really

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,399
do to privately contact somebody when

00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:44,570
this kind of thing happens so you want

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,690
something a little bit more solid this

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,910
is less for WordPress teams because

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,490
they're usually a little bit more

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,070
distributed and smaller but a war room

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,920
if you do have a semi large organization

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,889
and all of it is in a big open office

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,260
floorplan they need to have somewhere

00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:05,089
that they can go to discuss sensitive

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,860
details about the incident response

00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:10,160
process without having to worry about

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,769
being overheard or eavesdropped upon and

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,720
then of course clean backups which are

00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:17,630
always good to have but we'll talk a

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,060
little bit more about those later this

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,890
is also where I want to talk about the

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,300
easiest incident to handle is the one

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:28,070
that didn't happen easily right so we

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,350
can minimize the number of incidents

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,990
that we have to deal with by securing

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,790
our assets so all this stuff from all my

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,029
other talks like run risk assessments

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,769
and patch your software and get some

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:41,269
sort of intrusion detection like a

00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:45,199
malware scanner or something more

00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:47,690
host-based going you want to really

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,970
shore up your security in this phase

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:54,680
that way hopefully the rest of it never

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:58,760
has to come into play step two is

00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,760
detection and our goal with the

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,569
detection stage is to reduce TPD which

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,459
is time to detection so it's from the

00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:11,269
point an incident actually happens so

00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:13,610
when the bad doer did bad - when I know

00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,920
about it that is a nebulous period of

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,230
time and I want it to be as small as

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,600
possible that way I can minimize the

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,170
impact and I can get everything back to

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,149
normal that much faster we're

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,839
to reduce TTD by identifying attack

00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:33,399
vectors precursors and indicators of

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:36,310
compromise an attack vector is just

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,740
simply all the places that somebody

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,980
could attack they're gonna be different

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:45,699
for everybody and their response to each

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:48,100
varies based on its own scope so to

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,930
speak so your Web Services like your

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,630
actual WordPress site that is an attack

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,459
vector things like email or removable

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,350
media like if somebody slips a malware

00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,060
ridden flash drive into your computer

00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,730
that could impact your WordPress site if

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,110
you connect to it

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,800
impersonation things like fishing or

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,440
just otherwise people trying to trick

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,079
you into doing something you don't want

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,170
and improper usage is one that people

00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,959
end up dealing with in larger and larger

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,610
organizations like somebody has their

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,889
work computer and they downloaded some

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,350
file sharing tool onto it and got some

00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:24,910
malware through that that is an attack

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,560
vector even though it's something that

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,560
they sort of did to themselves a

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,910
precursor is a sign that an attack is

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:37,180
about to happen or maybe about to happen

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,829
not all incidents have precursors but

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,300
these are things like server logs

00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:41,890
telling you that somebody has been

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,920
running a vulnerability scan on your

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,120
website like WP scan or sequel map if

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,589
somebody is doing that without your

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,110
permission it could be a sign that

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:53,290
they're trying to find some way in

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,870
if wordfence or any other security body

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,970
has issued a vulnerability warning about

00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,920
software you use so a plug-in you use or

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,329
the WordPress version you're on that

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,160
could be a sign that something is going

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,839
to be coming around the corner and

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,240
almost certainly it will if it's an

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,680
actual vulnerability report and of

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,540
course if you've received a threat

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,500
that's a pretty good precursor that

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,899
something might be up and lastly

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,640
indicators of compromised are signs that

00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,899
an attack has happened or may have

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,380
already happened

00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,790
so I OCS are gonna vary based on the

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,040
attack vector they're associated with

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,709
but this is gonna be stuff like unusual

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,089
login activity somebody logged in with

00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,819
your username from a country you've

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,769
never been to that's questionable at a

00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:36,770
larger scale you know if somebody never

00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,920
logs in

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:43,399
after 8 p.m. and now they're logged in

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,920
at 3 a.m. that's weird so you want some

00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,810
kind of information about these events

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,700
as they come in

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,200
but other things like malware detected

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,209
on your server that's obviously a bad

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,120
indicator or files that have

00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:57,830
mysteriously changed or user reports

00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,540
that came in through the method that

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,550
whatever method that you laid out and

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,640
step 1

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,940
so indicators that compromise have taken

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,740
place they need to be verified you know

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,100
not every little event that we're

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,200
curious about is actually a sign of

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,020
something bad happening which is why

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,730
step 3 is analysis this is where we're

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,490
actually going through and vetting this

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,170
information that we've gathered so some

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,240
steps to make this easier going to be

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,370
things like knowing what baseline

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,080
behavior looks like it's really hard to

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,850
know what's weird if you don't know what

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,310
normal looks like this means being

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,870
familiar with your log activity the

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,070
amounts of traffic you usually get

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:42,260
things like that log retention policies

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,060
are important a lot of people are on

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,070
shared hosting and have no control over

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,040
how their logs are stored or for how

00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,029
long or where they go when they're gone

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,880
so you need to confirm that you have

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:55,910
some amount of access to this over time

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,649
especially because incidents can happen

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,450
long before they're detected if

00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,520
something happened three months ago and

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,819
you only have 30 days of log retention

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,699
you're fighting blind and then online

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,410
research like if you find a sketchy PHP

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,720
file and it's got some code in it you

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:15,220
don't really understand try googling it

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,220
it works a lot more often than you think

00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:22,309
if we've determined that an incident has

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:25,550
taken place then it's we have to start

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,350
mobilizing for a more active response we

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,150
want to try to identify the intrusion

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,059
vector sometimes we can't right away or

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,370
even at all we want to find out how our

00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:36,110
CI a has been impacted so our

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,750
confidentiality integrity and

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,850
availability and we want to try to

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,059
identify early in this process the

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,890
recoverability which is how soon can I

00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:47,690
get back to normal after this has been

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,730
done you want to at least get estimates

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,480
of all of these before you start

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,940
contacting

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,830
things like law enforcement your

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,580
Incident Response Team your own

00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,230
leadership

00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,010
you know maybe HR needs to be involved

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:03,860
if you think something inside happened

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:09,590
but from there I added this at the last

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:11,260
second so when it comes to D F IR so

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:15,590
digital forensics and Incident Response

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:17,840
it is a very specialized skill set it

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,330
uses tools and skills and knowledge and

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,049
data that your average sysadmin or IT

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:26,809
person may not have completely under

00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:28,639
control there's a lot of the tools that

00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:30,919
are relatively user friendly but they

00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:32,899
just kind of rely on you know hunches

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,049
and knowledge that experts have that

00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:39,049
somebody who isn't used to this may not

00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:41,269
even big organizations contact outside

00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:43,220
Incident handlers from time to time even

00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:45,679
hosting providers that have their own

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,139
sock so security operations center where

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,730
they actually have a team watching logs

00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:52,460
and events for things that are going

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,200
wrong if they find an incident they

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,889
still call somebody who is an expert in

00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,710
forensics if something mission critical

00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:02,149
is on the line it really may not be the

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:06,980
best time to try to save a buck or two

00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:08,510
and keep it in the house so we've

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,909
identified that something has happened

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,720
and we've identified and confirmed it's

00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:16,519
bad so we need to contain it we need to

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,590
stop it from getting worse we need to

00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,470
stop the the malicious actor from

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,419
continuing what they're doing and so

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,010
we've got some questions to ask so

00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,559
depending on what we've found

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,000
do we need to shut anything down do we

00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,350
need to take the site offline in the

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,139
meantime while we figure out what's

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,510
going on if so how long do we have to do

00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:37,610
this for and and knowing that early

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,669
helps you make future decisions further

00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:43,279
down the process what sort of evidence

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,659
do we need to preserve and this is a big

00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,019
step that I want to point out early

00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:50,169
because everybody loves to panic and

00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:54,740
delete the malware that they just found

00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:56,170
that makes forensics so much harder

00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,640
because it's evidence it's all evidence

00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,940
it's like moving a body because it's

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,940
gross

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:10,309
and then from what can and what can we

00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,049
learn about the attackers behavior from

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:17,059
this other stuff that we've gathered and

00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:19,790
looked at if we think a legal follow-up

00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:22,130
is required we have to be very careful

00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:25,309
with evidence so we need to take care of

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:27,530
logs we need to note attacker ip's time

00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,860
stamps of everything malware hashes file

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,940
contents that have been modified

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,730
everything that you can think of that is

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,280
half way irrelevant your investigator is

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,630
going to want and so you need to enforce

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,179
a chain of custody with this data

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,530
especially

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,770
party then they're probably handling it

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:47,690
but in house who is touching this data

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,419
how is it being stored if somebody moves

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,549
something from one point to another how

00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:54,770
is this being tracked and that way if a

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,450
discrepancy comes up later you can try

00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,950
to pull that thread and figure out what

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:03,590
happened and step it's finally step five

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,970
of seven and we're finally at the point

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,010
where we can actually start deleting

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,049
stuff and so we're destroying the

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,169
invaders at this point right and

00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:14,260
depending on the scope it can vary but

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:17,120
it can also be bundled in with step six

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,700
but this is where we're deleting malware

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,799
or cleaning up injections and otherwise

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,360
good files going through database

00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,190
contents and cleaning things up from

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,500
there it's just getting rid of the nasty

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,500
stuff so that we can start to rebuild

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:36,650
which is step six so one of the biggest

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,290
parts of step six is recovering from

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,780
backup in most cases so hopefully you

00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:46,370
have a clean backup if you don't shame

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:49,220
on you get one get many if you were

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,919
positive that this backup is pristine

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,990
and has not been compromised and that

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,510
the scope of the infection only covers

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:59,770
what is in this backup then restoring

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,720
from it probably covers your step five

00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:04,340
if not then you need to obviously have

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,290
done Step five

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,970
this is also where we're going to be

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,130
trying to fix any vulnerability

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,860
that were used in the part in the

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,200
process of this attack so we figured out

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,120
that oh we had plug-in XYZ that was

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,450
outdated somebody walked in through that

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,910
weird door well we need to fix that

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:25,390
and then after any incident it's just

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:28,040
always safe to update your secrets so

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,470
your passwords obviously if you have any

00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,030
kind of keys that you login with to your

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,920
you know SSH keys you get into your

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,500
server with sometimes it's a good idea

00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,260
to go ahead and switch those out and the

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,520
salts that you use to assault your

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,980
password hashes in your database

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,250
that's all in WP config it's really easy

00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,870
to generate new ones but it just it

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:51,820
prevents somebody who has already had

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:55,430
access from finding a new way back in

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:58,880
and then after the recovery we're all

00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:01,220
back to normal business as usual what

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,290
did we learn so this this whole step 7

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,790
is is taking this information everything

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,990
that we've learned from this terrible

00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:12,080
occurrence and processing it so what

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:15,200
happened when did it happen did we

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,720
respond effectively what could we have

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,540
used sooner as far as information or

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,310
data goes you know you know how much

00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,110
quicker could we have gotten through all

00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:28,600
of these steps had we known blank right

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:31,130
what things did we do poorly that's

00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,880
almost more important than talking about

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:36,800
what we did well right and then just

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,860
figuring out things that could have made

00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,630
all of this process easier or even

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:47,450
better prevent it from happening again

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:49,460
in the first place and then from there

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,640
we want to make some decisions about the

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,230
retention of our evidence so if

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,450
especially if we're gonna have a legal

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,210
follow-up how long do we want to keep

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:02,030
this evidence that we have stored NIST's

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,220
guideline for actual federal entities

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:07,610
says that following an incident you need

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:10,340
to retain this evidence for 3 years I'm

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,690
not a federal agency I don't know if any

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,380
of you guys are so you can make your own

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,910
rules here but depending on what you're

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,530
going to be doing next you may want to

00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,930
keep track of this data for a while and

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,880
how are you going to retain that data

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,980
are you going to keep it on the cloud

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,650
somewhere are you gonna have off-site

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,180
storage or some physical media how much

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,070
does any of this cost that you want to

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:35,230
factor this in so it's not coming as a

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:38,090
surprise when it does actually happen

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,170
and I really rushed through all of this

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,080
Wow

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,880
and our final recommendations just kind

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,130
of from the top down we want to identify

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,040
all of our resources before an incident

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,230
occurs this includes your off-site

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,610
incident response team if you're looking

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,040
to have one so if you're wanting

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,230
wordfence or some other security company

00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,790
to do the cleanup you want to be in

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,140
touch with them ahead of time or at

00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,630
least have some kind of relationship

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,560
there so you're not shopping around at

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:08,600
the worst possible moment it'd be a

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,170
really bad time right it would kind of

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,810
take your bargaining power away um

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:17,510
minimize future incidents by securing

00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:21,560
your assets so you have to respond to

00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:23,960
fewer if fewer happen automate detection

00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,710
as much as you can I so I've got plenty

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,510
of time I could talk about this so the

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,270
biggest thing that you want to look at

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,590
and unfortunately it's so case specific

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,910
that it's hard to just say oh yeah it's

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:40,340
this you want to be notified of anything

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,990
quickly anything that you want to be

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:46,250
notified about at least I guess so

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:50,780
login events or big waves of blocked

00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:53,660
attacks or anything like that as much as

00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,970
you can be informed of as quickly as

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,730
possible it's going to help prevent it

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,710
from flying under the radar or going

00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,300
unnoticed for too long and and letting

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,990
somebody really get a foothold in your

00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:08,180
website you want to keep reliable

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,270
backups and you want to be doing them

00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,370
regularly especially the more you make

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,900
changes to your site or the more data

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:20,360
flows in and out of it you want to be

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,980
backing up and test those backups my

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,990
least favorite thing about Incident

00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:28,610
Response is when somebody has a backup

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:29,900
that isn't good maybe it's old or it

00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,750
doesn't contain everything they thought

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,429
it did or the process the script has

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,389
been broken for six months and we

00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:40,039
just found out because we needed one

00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:42,110
preventing this is just as easy as

00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:44,690
testing it spin up a test environment

00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:47,600
try to recover from backup in that test

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,279
environment if it works awesome if it

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,119
doesn't you really need to fix that

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:55,190
right away when an incident occurs don't

00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,159
destroy evidence I really don't want to

00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,840
have to say that out loud but don't do

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,029
it and that includes things like

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,019
destroying files that are signs of

00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:04,940
something bad happening

00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:08,389
you know maybe rename it if you have to

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,399
get it out of a workable state you know

00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:13,009
if it's a PHP script you knock that PHP

00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:15,169
extension off it won't work anymore but

00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:16,789
don't nuke it because it may have

00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,289
references to other files that your

00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:21,049
incident handler might want it might

00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:24,470
have any other amount of data that could

00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:26,840
be handy in this response process keep

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,850
clear communication with everybody this

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,009
includes your users this includes the

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,419
other people on your team the last thing

00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,830
somebody wants is to be kept in the dark

00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:39,350
when their data is at stake

00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:41,360
and learn from these incidents when

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:43,159
you're doing that that step 7 post

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,600
mortem where we're having a meeting and

00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,639
we're talking about with everybody about

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,249
what happened and what lessons we

00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:51,200
learned this is not an opportunity to

00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:53,690
publicly execute the person you feel is

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,070
responsible so if somebody forgot to

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,190
patch or if it's a vulnerability

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:00,710
somebody wrote and we know it the money

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,649
any money that has been lost has already

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,749
been lost at this point you can either

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,669
try to take it as something bad and

00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:10,039
Lampoon somebody in front of the rest of

00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:11,389
the class and ensure that nobody is ever

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,029
going to cooperate with this process

00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,700
again or we can call it some really

00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:21,820
unique and expensive training and move

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:26,529
forward and learn thanks for stopping by

00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,529
if you have any questions ask away

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,999
I'm on Twitter at hey it's Mike Evie and

00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:37,840
you can check out our blog wordfence

00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:42,059
comm slash blog any questions yes yes

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,059
I'll post it on Twitter as soon as I can

00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:54,399
tripwire I'm not familiar with sounds

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,379
good to me I don't know anything about

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,210
the product though but yeah file change

00:28:56,379 --> 00:29:03,940
monitoring stuff like that is very handy

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:05,769
regardless of who's providing it so for

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,980
file change monitoring I actually use

00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:11,649
git so if you just keep your site's

00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:15,129
content in a git repository it's really

00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:19,539
easy to tell if something's changed also

00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:21,460
as far as file changes go I am more on

00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:24,399
the side of having some kind of malware

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,990
detection and play on this especially we

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,570
deal with a lot of sites where files get

00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,999
uploaded a lot you know images or user

00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:33,249
content gets move it around so any

00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:34,629
updated file could very likely be a

00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:37,480
false positive but something that's

00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:40,119
performing malware detection or any kind

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,789
of heuristic like that at least alerts

00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:45,539
you to say get your eyes on this with a

00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:47,499
little bit better signal-to-noise ratio

00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:50,669
I'll have to look at that specific

00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,669
software though yes

00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:02,710
and I just thinking in my mind like this

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:06,020
must be very expensive to implement and

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:09,560
like how big of a company would you say

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:15,800
would this be more clickable to as you

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:17,420
know so it you really don't need to be a

00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,850
company I mean if you're in this room

00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:21,320
and use WordPress at least some of this

00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,440
information you want to keep in your

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,490
pocket if you're not spending a bunch of

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,900
money to do this

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,720
you can cobble together some batch

00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,130
scripts to check some stuff out or

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,930
install I mean wordfence has a free

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,450
plugin that can handle some of the

00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:38,300
malware detection for you there are ways

00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,920
to make a good solid best effort on

00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,970
every one of these steps without

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,740
breaking your budget especially when it

00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,030
comes to like our site cleaning services

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,190
I don't want to make the whole pitch

00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,490
right now in front of everybody but it's

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:55,010
it's not crazy expensive and especially

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,570
compared to outages and things like that

00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,840
especially if any money is coming

00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:23,210
through that site it's an easy call to

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:25,160
make it could be you would want to look

00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,740
and so look at all the software like the

00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,170
plugins and stuff running on your site

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,220
make sure all of them are up-to-date

00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,330
having everything up-to-date doesn't

00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,430
necessarily mean there's no

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,340
vulnerabilities in it but it's at least

00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:44,420
a good step to prevent known

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:47,270
vulnerabilities from existing yes yeah

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,310
there can be a vulnerability in any any

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:51,680
piece of code that runs on your site or

00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:54,170
even lives in the same directory on your

00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,520
site like if you have an old copy of the

00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:57,500
site sitting in a folder somewhere

00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,080
that's not getting updated that still

00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:03,110
exists and and we see that a lot where

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,390
we've got like staging folder with an

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,430
ancient website still kicking in it and

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:10,300
there's you know malware in it or some

00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,300
other vulnerability

00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,560
yes you you want to make sure that the

00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:33,390
only files on your site are the ones

00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:38,360
that need to be there yes so it's a good

00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:40,470
question it just really depends on how

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,620
so if you only have a week's worth of

00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,110
backups then that's and that's fine

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,460
because a lot of people don't have any

00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,220
but if you only have a week's worth of

00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,020
backups you need to be aware of any

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,420
incident happening within a week of it

00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,340
happening so if something bad had

00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:00,120
happened eight days ago all of your

00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,500
backups are corrupted now so you a lot

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,600
of the time people will have like a

00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,790
rolling week of daily backups but then

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,970
they'll have one a month old one two

00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:14,340
months old something like that it's just

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:15,630
in case yep as long as you're doing some

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,490
kind of checking to make sure that

00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:32,400
everything is good within the range of

00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:33,720
your backup availability yeah that's

00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,730
kind of the thing yeah if you're not

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,290
getting alerts and stuff or even if you

00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,090
are getting alerts saying hey we blocked

00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,700
something that's business as usual like

00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,130
we said you know a blocked attack is

00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,930
just an event it's not an incident so

00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,090
sometimes those alerts are just

00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,220
notifications but if if your software

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,410
does say hey Red Alert this is a problem

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,030
then obviously you want to respond I

00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,220
don't know specifically about that

00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:58,580
plugin I know wordfence has a free

00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,290
plugin that does very similar stuff and

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,980
I like ours better than anybody else is

00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,980
to participate

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:11,800
but it's yeah as long as your remaining

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,079
at least a little bit vigilant and

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,200
trying you're putting yourself that much

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,720
higher than everybody else so anything

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:24,730
else

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:27,899
cool beans well I did they're in my bag

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,899
I'll be at the happiness bar

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:31,990
cool well thank you guys for coming out

00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,369
I'm glad glad I get the turnout I got

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,720
here I wasn't expecting so many people

00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,720
in here thanks you guys

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,629
