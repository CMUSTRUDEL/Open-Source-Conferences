[Music]

00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,100
so

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,840
[Music]

00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:38,629
working good so I've been working with

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,160
the web since 94 I was really lucky bit

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,019
stupid really my boss turned out to me

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,579
and said we're gonna train you for the

00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,850
Internet and I said mass really boring

00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:49,129
this is gonna be a fad luckily it wasn't

00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,420
and most I was there until I was

00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,180
building computer rooms for them and

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,460
stuff like that when we used to have

00:00:52,180 --> 00:01:00,050
1,000 service in a room and stuff anyhow

00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,879
currently today I look after lots of

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,309
NGOs and other sorts of organizations

00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:06,470
which care very fine mr. numbers the one

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:08,240
to kind of talk about the minute R&W

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,290
gets up to have 30 million visitors a

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,590
month I'm kind of a full-stack kind of

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:19,420
guy I do DevOps play of servers do tech

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:22,490
need and also CTO advice for companies

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,950
where we startups and corporates and

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,170
while you may met just about but I would

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,369
like to work in the nonprofit sector

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,250
because I'd like to feel that I'm doing

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:34,040
something that's well good I think it's

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:37,220
best way to say lead I've been on the

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,250
Facebook group for WordPress hosting and

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,840
that's about 10,000 people there and of

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,790
course I'm from corn or you can might

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,850
hear my voice and I've been here for 18

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,350
years so that means I can speak Dutch so

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,799
as an Oda case you can be a frog in

00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:55,430
megawatts doing bad it's like summer and

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:58,670
it kind of edge it all so I work a lot

00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,490
with RW their radio Nagel ins world on

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,979
loop as it was and they've changed from

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,190
being the world service to being a

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:09,890
charity now NGO and they focus on two

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,180
major things and that's a citizen's

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,340
voice visions of democracy and good

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,099
governance and those guys on the left

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,980
they risk their lives military risk

00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,330
their lives by blogging about things

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,180
they want changed in their respective

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,640
countries so yoghurt in Burundi the

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,459
poorest place in Africa embrace Mali

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,450
her body is in Congo the one that's

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:34,260
bottom or left

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,670
is actually Libya then what Yemen that's

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,489
got the slowest internet in the world

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,920
and lastly China there's one there for

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,530
problems with migrant workers and

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,209
getting sexually assaulted and stuff so

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,120
we try and deal with these things and

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,250
then on the right is love matters which

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,989
is a pleasure positive kind of approach

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,650
to sex and trying people who teach

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:58,500
people how to do it well how to behave

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,480
towards your partner and of course all

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,019
the sexual health things with STDs and

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,060
whatever

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:08,069
Westy eyes if you're Dutch okay so for

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,310
the next bit of time think of me as your

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,569
new CTO and you are the management team

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,060

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,850
anything you can think of and I just

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,470
come up with that and please join in

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,140

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,209
a better time and yes I will be

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,610
mentioning companies for and showing

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,680
people's names and faces I have no

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,959
affiliation with any of these so I'm not

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,410
getting any kickbacks or unless they buy

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:39,630
me beer later okay thank you

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,470
so first things first you do get what

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,420
you pay for

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,500
I'm sure it's got a Dutch one as well so

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,690
what is the hosting provider it's

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,269
somebody that looks after the software

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,090
and the hardware and prints the internet

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,100
links for you so that you can have your

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,750
website they're not necessarily

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,299
responsible for your themes will plug in

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:05,070
and probably or not and they might be

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:06,810
responsible WordPress so just a global

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,950
thing to start with things to watch out

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,930
for is first tier pricing the most hosts

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,430
offer something that's like cheap get

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,500
them in loss leader whatever you want to

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,299
call it and then they'll ramp it up

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,489
maybe two or three times as high the

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,210
following year

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,680
anybody that promises unlimited anything

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,380
they're probably lying to you or hiding

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,440
it somewhere in the terms of service as

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,440
a fair use

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,760
or something there's always a limit

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:40,780
always certain organizations will charge

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,250
you a lot for SSL yeah even though if

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,930
it's free they'll charge you for let's

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:48,700
say um let's encrypt yeah hidden costs

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,610
the puddle jumping that's where you

00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,530
choose a new hosting company every year

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,510
you're wasting your time for the 20 or

00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,250
30 euros you're saving on hosting you're

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,460
using 20 30 hours to do it

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,430
so don't find a good one the first time

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,530
and yeah the biggest thing to watch out

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,360
for is you really should choose your

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,280
hosting to be near where your client

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,990
base is oh that's gonna be difficult if

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,030
they're global but if you can't choose

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:18,610
somebody that's local to you okay so we

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,350
were you it's anybody here that's a

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:27,430
blogger by trade no goods business

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:33,210
owners that's most of the people in the

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:41,050
room then okay and hosting companies

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:43,480
there's one down there as well okay so

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,250
go do some cross section is there

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,040
anybody here that apart from the hosting

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,690
companies now that deals in really high

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,020
numbers of visitors so I mean - I'm

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,250
talking millions plus No okay cool so

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,780
we'll kind of focus on those a little

00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,460
bit more the options for you guys so

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,090
first things first before you buy

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,040
anything you make a shopping list yeah

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,840
there's lots of questions could I ask

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,790
not just of yourself in your

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,400
organization but maybe of the developer

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:15,550
you're working with and find out as much

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,490
information about what you need so you

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,810
know where are your customers what sort

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,440
of content you happy you like really

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,750
image-heavy

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,840
are you I'm a video site are you a

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,520
like your for your photography

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,350
what kind of date space do you need you

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,810
need ecommerce all these other questions

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,610
will help you come down to who you

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,200
really need and if you take this

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,360
shopping list with you to everybody that

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,710
you're coming into contact with you're

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,280
gonna make a better choice it's a

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,280
simpler time

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,810
okay so let's start with free one this

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,050
would be blogger so there's nobody in

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,510
the room if you just started yeah why

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,940
not just wordpress.com there's some pros

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,940
it's free it's good you get to choose

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,950
your domain name but it's really limited

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,050
for so many different reasons and of

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,250
course they are put advertising on your

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:10,680
website so the advice really is only do

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,780
it when you don't have this no one else

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,790
there isn't anybody that you should as a

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,880
business being creating their website on

00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:21,810
there I know I've done it before just

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:25,770
for fun bits there can be lots of really

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:30,300
using quick setup okay

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:33,180
cheap shared hosting there's a lot of

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,310
organizations companies out the world

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,729
who try and sell you the one dollar a

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,260
month hosting so it's like I know twelve

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:44,070
dollars for the year or something like

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:45,120
that while it's better than the free one

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,910
that you're gonna get from WordPress

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,000
really don't do it unless you absolutely

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:53,610
have to

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,500
yeah how can they possibly offer that is

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,650
the question you would ask yourself they

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,270
must have really cheap employees they

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,430
must have really cheap administration

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,770
systems they must not want to upgrade

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,690
their servers they must all these other

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:12,120
things to be able to offer at that price

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:16,169
it's just logic you can't you can't pay

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,140
people I like 20 30 40 $50 an hour to

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:22,080
maintain stuff if you're only making 10

00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,300
cents an hour so yeah if you consider

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,050
the electricity alone for a server might

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,840
cost more than the they're $12 in a year

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,760
so you're not really gonna get the best

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,650
for you're not gonna get anything super

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,979
with that and of course they're gonna

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:40,880
upsell you whenever possible and they'll

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,970
become a pain in the ass really quickly

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,330
however if you ask Matt who runs the

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,970
hosting Namecheap he'll sell you that

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:54,089
they can do it and they put a ridiculous

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,610
math technology into it it accumulates

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,470
and all sorts of oberstar fear it's

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,150
really interesting there's a link to and

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,459
ask me anything we did in the WordPress

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,010
hosting where he tries to describe all

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:08,220
and yeah he's willing to offer you

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,020
something for a year for $12 still we

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,280
are limitations you only have 3

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,410
gigabytes data space um Strato

00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,010
I'd say they're Dutch Dutch in Germany I

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,380
believe they have Dutch offices and they

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,350
will offer you a $1 a month I was think

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,410
but as we said earlier the second year

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:34,110
pricing it's $60 or 60 euros a year so

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:36,959
big jobs okay yeah

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,080
target audience people who don't invest

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,390
wanna invest in their business really

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,070
basic we're prisoners so the less said

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,650
about them the better and we just don't

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,450
do it really okay

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,810
professional shared host and this is

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,400
where most of you are gonna be looking

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,570
to be honest he was shared or will come

00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,330
on to the other ones this is the start

00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:04,890
of the interesting bits thanks so we

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:07,830
have some pros and cons to this usually

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,650
they offer free SSL way of letting

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,959
critters often there is you know free

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,850
domain name in the package and quality

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,240
support staff and good administration

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,339
tools

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,860
everybody's got cPanel or something

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:27,839
similar or up less but it also has other

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:30,190
problems the biggest Possible's is this

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,329
one here

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,339
possible they'll be out of action for a

00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:36,949
long time because something else on the

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:39,350
server somebody else somebody else's

00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:42,350
website it's causing problem with your

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,269
website some companies will put

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,240
thousands and thousands and thousands of

00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,589
websites on to one server and just try

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,920
and make it work and that's how they

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:54,230
make their profits and so you've got to

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,060
try and talk to the agency first website

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,449
to the company first try and find out

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,519
how they work so you find out will you

00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:05,839
get screwed if somebody else is causing

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,750
a problem okay and you also might not

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,399
have SSH access that's a secure way of

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,800
logging in to the server if you're

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,110
really into technology you might want

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,790
that so I've only shopping list make

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:22,750
sure of what you're buying oh and again

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,339
of course the upsell for a fix

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:30,769
okay starting price probably around

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:33,459
twenty dollars fifteen euros or so and

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:36,769
yeah it's people that value their stuff

00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:40,130
it is simple for a business but it's

00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:42,380
still lower to you yeah if you get like

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,019
a really high amount of traffic you post

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:48,319
goes by or something it could just fall

00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,760
out of the water really quickly and the

00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:52,699
company's telling you that you've got to

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,170
pay more money or something so yeah you

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:55,459
might need to work with them if you're

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,220
doing a marketing plan where you're

00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:59,810
getting a lot of new visitors you need

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,910
to let them know what's going on so that

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:08,089
they can maybe create a person

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:12,550
capability okay so this the usual

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,550
suspects for the class-leading

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:19,819
web hosts now pistol at the left there

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,689
he's the no great ma you can also go and

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,949
have a look at that

00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:26,180
he's from Sai ground they are in the

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:30,259
WordPress hosting group probably

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,379
recommended the most next is a flywheel

00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:35,809
they also get a lot of red

00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:39,449
Dacians and bricks also diddle of the MA

00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:41,309
David I think the point out here is all

00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:43,319
of these people will take the time to

00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,639
speak to you you don't have to just go

00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:46,979
and look at what offerings on the

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,419
website they'll charge you for however

00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:49,709
long it's needed just to make sure that

00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,839
you are happy they want to have good

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:54,509
customers just as much as you want to

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,329
have a good thing so really try and take

00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:58,859
the time to do it well and you won't be

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:02,399
upset when it comes to that second year

00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:05,669
or third year or whatever and then as

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,699
Hamlet at the end there for pantalons

00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:10,139
okay we have our defi engine guy down

00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:19,069
here who knows everything about hosting

00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:22,139
ever okay self managed so there is

00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:25,229
self-managed VPSs where they've really

00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,659
cheap virtual private server it's kind

00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:29,699
of like a shared server what shared

00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,799
hosting in the respect that there's one

00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:35,509
big server that there's chopped up into

00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:38,639
many pieces and you get a piece of it so

00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:42,710
you could still suffer problems when

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:47,750
that's done okay anything

00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:51,130
oh you started six dollars with per

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:54,110
month whip did situation that's cheap

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,880
very very cheap but you're the one that

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,470
has to install it you're the one has to

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,370
set up you're the one that owns the

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,320
security you're the one and if you don't

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,720
have time to do that it's gonna be a

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,390
real pain and also if you of course you

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,260
have lots of customers all on a real

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:14,660
pain so yeah extremely fast they're in

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,760
good locations if you look at

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,160
digitalocean Linode or anything elbows

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,570
they have plenty of locations you can

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,740
choose where you want it to be so it's

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:27,200
near your customers but like I say you

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,570
own it you manager you secure it an

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,000
ownership takes a lot of time and my

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:35,120
advice is unless you're really desperate

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,880
the safe money and our technical don't

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,950
do it even if you're technical and know

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,170
what you're doing consider consider it

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,350
twice because you can probably make more

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:48,410
money doing other work than fixing your

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,510
own websites okay so that's like a bunch

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,640
of jargon in terms you know PHP varnish

00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:55,220
and genetic patching breeders memcache

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,830
postfix if you know them great

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:04,180
crank I come in have a go if you don't

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:06,890
don't do it okay so the ones on the left

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,740
are the really cheaper ones they'll come

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,750
the struggle a six dollars ten dollars

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,100
for a month for a thin the ones on the

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,550
right are the ones that gets expensive

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,089
and are also much more difficult to

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:23,360
understand their product offering if

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,760
you're not an expert in I'd know AWS the

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,020
Amazon Web Services you can end up

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,240
spending a lot of money you don't need

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,279
to spend so it's really worth

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,709
considering for any of those ones on the

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,650
right to try and find an expert to help

00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:38,120
you if you're going to do that one of

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,790
the experts I've worked with before

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,670
when I was working with an organisation

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,100
they we went through

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,980
myself and Rackspace did this where they

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,980
had I think there was a 230 line items

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,959
with we had all going for AWS Rackspace

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,480
came in and worked out the only 120 of

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,250
those who needed so 110 things were

00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,560
being paid for each month that just

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,470
didn't need to exist or could have been

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,360
you know moved into one so really

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:08,200
consider getting the expert in if you're

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:12,579
gonna go down this route okay and of

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,019
course to be a proper web host you would

00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:16,690
have enough people available with 24

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:20,589
hours a day to do the support so that's

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,329
a minimum of 6 people every day and then

00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:24,760
you've got weekends as well because

00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:28,240
getting them to people for 8 hours three

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,730
times that every day so a lot of people

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:36,160
you gotta have so consider it twice

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:40,810
before you jump in now okay and managed

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,850
VPSs this is probably the sweet spot at

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,459
the moment in hosting of where people

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:49,899
are making the most advantage of their

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:53,380
own money when there's penguin you can

00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:55,690
grow quite quickly with it yeah you know

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,260
you don't have to support of course it's

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:02,380
things that have a proven track record

00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:05,319
so for example a company that is doing

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,540
manage VPS they will work out the best

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,390
platform the best pack that they can

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,040
have so what version of PHP what version

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,140
of readers what all these other little

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,339
bits and plug them all together for you

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:20,350
so you don't have to think twice about

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,329
it and they'll also control the security

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:28,329
which is a big thing you don't to be

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:29,860
responsible for big faking and okay some

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,080
of them don't offer you SSH access

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,660
because if you can log in this room you

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,160
can break it with it you know you can't

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,960
always a start install everything you

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,910
want there's an example that I failed to

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,299
ban which is a thing you can use a PHP

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:47,499
level to ban people by

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:49,659
addresses yeah and I could say you have

00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:52,960
to be a bit savvy we're making the

00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,369
purchase at spec it out properly so you

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,690
still might want to speak to your

00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:57,399
developer a little bit extra and say

00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,320
okay how much memory do I need how much

00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:02,049
disk space do any what's it gonna be in

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,860
two years time how BIG's it gonna be and

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:07,539
start to look at things on that level

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,289
okay managed starts at about $10 a month

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:15,369
I think that is CloudFlare and one cloud

00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:18,879
or both doing the same thing though but

00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:22,359
the big thing to recognize is that if

00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:25,090
you really want to use this kind of

00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,100
thing that you have to pay more for a

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,649
support I think is the best way to put

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,509
it so even though it's there for $10 if

00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:35,529
you want to get great support

00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:37,239
you're gonna pay more money yeah it this

00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:39,730
is probably where most you'll be looking

00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:42,609
right now where I see how professional

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,779
level hosting that can grow and you

00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:49,779
don't have to employ your own support

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:51,909
staff so the two on the left are very

00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,769
much in their own sort of ten dollar

00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:57,279
realm and the one on the right there

00:18:53,769 --> 00:19:01,889
consider they're on the kind of more $60

00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:05,350
a month realm okay

00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:09,340
both of these although it was white or

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:11,559
my screen weird must have some he's some

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,460
done an a male on the group second up at

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:19,179
the top I'm so so you can also about run

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,470
cloud are based in Malaysia so yeah it

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,249
can be difficult you want to speak in

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,529
our time to them card ways are based

00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:28,149
somewhere in the East in Arabic

00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:31,539
countries are continental where exactly

00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:34,389
and consider based out of America kids

00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:36,850
to give amazing support really will go

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:39,159
go above and beyond they'll try and look

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,049
into your problems your natural theme

00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,700
into your plugins and whatever they're

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,159
not gonna rewrite your code but they

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,289
will tell you where the problem is and

00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,359
yeah again you can find these people on

00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:54,869
Facebook and you can talk to them and

00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:58,869
there we go out to speak to you so

00:19:54,869 --> 00:20:00,519
recommendation first of all always check

00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:02,919
out that the company will do what you

00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,950
want to do so if your developers done

00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,119
something special then you want to know

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:13,049
it and you want to talk to them first

00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,049
and if you want great support pay for it

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,600
okay managed hosting this is can be on

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,639
shared it can be on your own server but

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,809
it's just general managed hosting

00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:30,639
there's some companies some in the room

00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,440
that work in this sphere then they don't

00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:33,909
really well

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,119
come on to the list of the best ones

00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:39,639
while class-leading was in a minute but

00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,070
where they really focus on is providing

00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:44,230
a platform where you can work and forget

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,429
about it it's not that you have to ever

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,279
think about what's happening on the

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:51,549
hosting so this is a really interesting

00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:54,820
one for people that maybe had a website

00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:55,869
to find design once and don't want to

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,960
touch it again in future

00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:02,950
it's just needs to work it needs to be

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,600
online um most of these will gladly put

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,619
on when commerce and all those sort of

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,019
other stuff really well biggest from my

00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:14,559
found with managed hosting is the

00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:16,599
account management often is American

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,249
time so if you're looking for the

00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,779
class-leading one you might find

00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:20,520
yourself having to talk with them at 7

00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,580
o'clock at night

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,240
for me that's not good and so I'd rather

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,440
choose something that's more local

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,110
therapy engine does have European

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,080
presence the guys here we opium present

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,910
well Hilversum presence there really

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,010
suffers but if you pump it on for

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,260
example if you really want to speak to

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,720
an account manager it's really late at

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,300
night for us so yeah you've got a

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:50,880
meeting one there and I help to be going

00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:53,160
down that path okay so price variable

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,090
but always expensive I think that's just

00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,720
the best way to put it

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,940
you pay for when you get this for your

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,160
large business digital agencies those

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,360
wannabe resellers if you want a

00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,040
comprehensive solution that's always

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,850
going to work really secure really

00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,450
really fast

00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,450
really great

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,970
and yeah it's where to aim if you

00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:17,909
already have a successful online

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,049
presence if you're already alive if

00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:21,149
you've already want to and you're

00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:23,899
looking to go that next step up these

00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,899
are the people to talk to

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:30,389
okay and it's a bit of a checklist of

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,990
all the stuff that they might possibly

00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:36,480
ask you to be able to join I this is a

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:40,230
checklist half from combination of

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,999
wpengine and truth and they're looking

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,659
to see how big your databases are how

00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:47,309
big your files are so you might still

00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,350
need somebody technical to find this

00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:52,379
information for you so you're able to

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,690
buy the right stuff again it's to save

00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:57,690
yourself money long term rather than

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,999
looking at wow I can buy the thing for

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,460
400 euros a month when you can actually

00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:04,409
afford so you might have to pay for the

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:13,289
one at 600 or we might only need the one

00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:15,990
is 200 okay so call the P engine so

00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:19,440
anybody else know unfortunately page

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:22,440
they just were there he maintains that

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,340
invented the managed hosting and way of

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,460
working and every else is a copy the guy

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,409
stand upon their wpx they say that they

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,179
will bend over backwards to make

00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:36,509
anything happen on hosting that you need

00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:38,519
so they're an interesting proposition so

00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:41,309
PO they say that they've the fastest

00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:43,080
hosting on the planet and they will

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:48,029
intellectual tester or at any point in

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:50,429
time I've put in there kenster although

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:53,639
they're using the infrastructure of

00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:56,190
other people just because they really do

00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:58,019
put the time to big be a managed

00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,999
situation they're really going to try

00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,530
hard for you and not just for them

00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:06,800
unlike

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:08,570
some host okay dedicated hosting this is

00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,570
where you want your owning and serve it

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:15,320
to yourself and no one else could share

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,970
it or touch it or whatever um yeah it's

00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:22,160
gonna be so fast it's gonna be

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:23,390
blistering with speed you're never gonna

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,730
have contention that's one of the

00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,430
problems with VPS is or with share

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,710
hosting there might be contention for

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,540
processing or disk or memory or whatever

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,970
some hosts are really good at it and

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,130
don't have that problem but some arts

00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,530
are good you're gonna get good support

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,030
and of course you can put as many

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,610
websites as you want on it

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:45,410
well I say as many as you want obviously

00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:51,140
the thousands and you're gonna need more

00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:53,240
dedicated machines um okay it's gonna

00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,100
get expensive really expensive and

00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,920
upgrading to be an absolute pain in the

00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,720
ass for example if you want upgrade the

00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,930
memory the whole system should be shut

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,310
down

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,650
somebody's gonna take it off the rack

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,270
put some new memory and if you want a

00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,420
bigger disk it's the same way if you

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,250
want to upgrade the processor so it can

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,650
be very expensive and time consuming to

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,270
do that kind of thing whereas other

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,570
types of hosting will take advantage

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:21,470
that they can do the upgrading and work

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:25,460
around these problems okay

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:30,740
so price variable they're really

00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:33,380
expensive yeah fast performance of the

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,820
hardware if you're into e-commerce

00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,720
something like that yeah it's a good

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,300
good choice

00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,320
it's just higher tier really kind of

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:44,530
veer looking almost enterprise I would

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,060
think if you're doing something like a

00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:51,530
successful online anything this is a

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:55,820
really good place to be in now yeah of

00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,890
course like um like VPSs you don't have

00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,560
to use the hosting company

00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,820
country but if you put one in this

00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,740
country and your audience is in the

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:06,580
Netherlands it's gonna be faster for the

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,410
people in the Netherlands okay so oh

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,900
yeah remember to choose one that has

00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,130
support in your prime time that's a big

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,890
one

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,290
I miss webpage me a couple years ago for

00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,580
hosting and I could never get supporter

00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:21,430
in the day time because they were only

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:26,160
working banking hours of America time so

00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:29,560
pain in the ass be very careful about

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,490
okay collocation that's where it's your

00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:35,680
hardware somebody else's computer room I

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,900
need to be honest with you it's a really

00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,280
bad deal you're taking away all of the

00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,110
benefits so you could have buy another

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,060
great hosting company look after

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:46,150
everything by swapping your stuff into

00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:48,790
the computer I once made a startup in

00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:52,840
this country price-wise price-wise now

00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:54,430
it's code and we did this at the time we

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,380
made our own servers and put them there

00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,540
and the amount of times out of cycle

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,250
from one side arms down to the other to

00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,250
turn on the servers again want to reboot

00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,940
them properly it was just stupid well so

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,350
we're yeah

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,500
I'm they're doing quite one on price

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:12,490
voice okay yeah no one's gonna support

00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,070
you but yourself

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:17,260
and you're really in control so it's a

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,000
it's just something bunch of risks so we

00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,850
don't do it and I think this is best for

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,980
them to say you don't buy a dog and bark

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,880
yourself I'm sure there's a Dutch

00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,020
translation somewhere yeah you don't

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:34,510
want you don't want to be your own guard

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:39,340
dog okay yeah don't do it don't we don't

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:41,260
do it pain heartache stress yeah real

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,910
pain in the ass and your if you're the

00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,070
one that has to go and reboot it push

00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,630
the button yeah constantly on edge

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,580
because people could phone you your

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:52,899
pager could go off your telephone

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,309
crazy at any point in time okay

00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:56,730
a high-performance cluster this is

00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:01,240
further people that get the millions of

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:03,220
visitors a month this is where you're at

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,140
a different level all together you

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,690
really want to find somebody that you

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,750
can talk to and get great account

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,039
administration so they are there at the

00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,480
end of the telephone but you can also

00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,760
just go round to their offices for a

00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,890
coffee because you're working at the

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,929
high ends you really want to make sure

00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,510
that your best mates and you've got the

00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:26,080
same intentions towards the future in

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:27,610
land it's not about just paying

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,240
something money it's about having a

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,620
relationship this is where you could

00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,090
have a good relationship with your

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,399
account manager with the hosting company

00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:38,740
with your developers and everybody's got

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,230
to work together to work at this it

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,899
becomes very difficult the difficulties

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,210
of having a cluster of service to do a

00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:47,649
job it is exponentially more difficult

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,570
than having one so we're doing the job

00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:51,519
because you have to deal with the way

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,049
the caching works you have to think

00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,500
about all these other problems that are

00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:58,600
just introduced and so if people meet

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,870
going down this route you've really got

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,940
to have friends on all sides so if

00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,470
you're finding that your companies don't

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,960
work your hosting companies don't

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:11,230
working with you then yeah seriously

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,049
consider moving I did this for RW last

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,909
year because they were with a hosting

00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,159
company where the account management was

00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:20,889
taking three weeks to respond from an

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,320
email and they were getting paid I don't

00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:26,559
know how many thousands a month but it

00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,529
was in the region of 40,000 euros a year

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,929
the hosting costs so you would expect

00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:34,690
somebody would reply it's not always the

00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:37,389
case so of course they're also dealing

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,669
with companies that will have 80,000 100

00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:41,440
pals doing if I was in the year span so

00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,139
yeah you can be a small fry in a big

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,450
pond okay

00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:49,630
everything gets a price service level

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,250
agreements can be incredibly costly if

00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,559
you want something to fix something in

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,360
an hour or beyond to put in five minutes

00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,640
you've got to pay for it and

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,890
to get the big in the way pricing just

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,830
as big as in employing a whole team of

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:07,990
people okay okay so it's gonna be around

00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:11,470
$40,000 so like let's say 36,000 euros a

00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,480
year to get a decent and cluster so

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,179
that's Doug be a pair of database

00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,340
servers a pair of web servers sub parent

00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:19,990
furnish and a pair of load balancers and

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:24,429
have them all sitting together and

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:26,290
working and yeah that will get you up to

00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:29,380
I know it's a fairly forty million

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,820
visitors a month no problem at all once

00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,400
you get over that and you gotta start

00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,270
looking a little bit differently maybe

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,040
just adding more Hardware maybe having

00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,299
different locations well we can maybe

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,140
talk about that later if anybody's got

00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:46,570
questions I can say really have some

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,160
units close enough to visit the company

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,840
that I said that we were sending emails

00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,230
to and they weren't responding they were

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,150
in the UK we were in help some problems

00:30:53,230 --> 00:31:01,750
so when I chose somebody in Amsterdam

00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:04,690
instead recently okay so we actually

00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,820
chose true fontanelle and they're the

00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,360
ones that also do our behind a bunch of

00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,130
others

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,900
if I was going international I did chunk

00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,400
up pounding on and that's why I say

00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,790
about the account management being

00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,940
Americans I'm only IBM yeah they will

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:21,340
say they'll do a page to sale order this

00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,410
type of company it took six are down in

00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,200
nine major I hope I'm pronouncing their

00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,570
name correctly I know they're workers

00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,270
from interactions and stuff and they're

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,610
very clever people so I would honestly

00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,059
investigate them in future that's an

00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,190
option

00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:38,140
they do what they become at work so

00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,900
they'll make whatever you need whatever

00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,790
scale so it's an interesting company but

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,720
right now I would say throughs probably

00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,500
one of the bigger ones in the

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,000
Netherlands okay

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:53,169
posting clearly for developers for

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,100
people like me Parthenon fiber element

00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:57,380
of P engine are all fine

00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,490
lots lots of tools so that that's really

00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,039
good for a developer so we've got

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,289
staging sites and all those other karna

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,929
capabilities flywheels invested a lot of

00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:07,429
money in having a capability for

00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:09,679
developers to develop locally on the

00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:11,450
machine much better

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:16,250
WP engine I believes does stuff like

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:17,210
that maybe in the future yeah okay and

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,450
in the Netherlands

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:23,270
trans IP gets a lot of positive press

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,429
I've never over within myself a lot of

00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:28,850
people say that very good true

00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:30,200
I've been genuinely pleased and these

00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,510
guys in the front almost in the front

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,929
row also apparently very good with the

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,280
developers because they come well well

00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:40,070
if I read the stuff that Ireland their

00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,720
rights it's clear that they are able to

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,929
talk on a technical level to other

00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,690
people so that's a good company I would

00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:54,530
say sorry I'm picking you up too much

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:57,200
I'll stop that okay resellers yeah these

00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:59,210
all offer extra tools to do reselling in

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,750
better ways and the ones on the left

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,730
there so flywheel has like an agency

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,530
type thing where you can work out all

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,570
the costings for all the set of people

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,270
passed on to something similar cycle and

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:13,190
also data engine does also cut so you

00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:17,870
can work out from all of these ones on

00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:20,030
the Left how your different things that

00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:23,090
you're reselling are doing and how much

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,980
they're taking up with the space once on

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,870
the right trans IP I'm told I'm really

00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,309
good on never use and let's say and the

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,570
guys are for Veda that are in the

00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:32,750
hallway you can talk to them about it

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:35,360
they are not really providing many tools

00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,059
but what they do do is force a situation

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,809
where depth what's you to resell

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:43,909
properly and preventing you from if your

00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:46,159
company goes our business so your

00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:48,500
customers our script that's their

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,720
viewpoint they're going to try and

00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,890
maintain that the end point customer is

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,100
always catered for

00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:57,320
no matter what now personally I'd never

00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,210
be reseller again I've done it before

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,490
I find it just from absolute pain in the

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,710
ass because you've got so much to do

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,019
you're constantly the one stuck in the

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:09,200
middle and for me personally if I was

00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:10,940
going to go forward again and start mmm

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,750
trying to connect up hosting agency

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:17,540
hosting companies and and people I

00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:20,530
probably would get on the the affiliate

00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,909
route and try and make money that way so

00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,550
more less every hosting company has an

00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:28,879
affiliate option I'm Joe

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:32,510
I would ask WP engine but they seem to

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:37,129
be taking me you guys you've got an

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:38,629
affiliate thing going on and it's

00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:41,659
alright thinking that once you get

00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:45,310
somebody gets in you pay the affiliate

00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,310
but returns you on you

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,650
[Music]

00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:09,170
and that's the great thing about the

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,730
opportunities yeah that's the thing if

00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,740
you're the reseller you control all that

00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,300
administrative tasks and if you're just

00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,930
an affiliate partner you don't have to

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,540
deal with that

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:20,630
I think that's an absolute benefit one

00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:23,180
of the guys we had do an AMA he's a gold

00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,859
affiliate for a grant and he turns over

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,130
a round about a hundred and fifty

00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:31,700
thousand dollars on recommendation only

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:36,109
so yeah if you want to look him up

00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:40,130
online media masters is as tall and yeah

00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:41,480
he yeah and so yeah if you want to look

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,339
him up you can see what he's doing it

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,050
makes very long detailed posts makes

00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:47,540
great recommendations people click

00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,589
through and you he makes money I'll say

00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,079
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:53,359
the year we promise focus there's only

00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:55,939
two that absolutely say that will come

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,969
as focused at the moment and that circle

00:35:55,939 --> 00:36:01,369
who have an offering liquid web who have

00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:04,160
one offering all the other companies are

00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,569
I said today will do more commerce but

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,059
they're not saying that focus on it just

00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:10,329
like it will work but these guys say

00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:15,079
though they really focused in on that

00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:16,939
okay just some cleanup which server

00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,680
should I choose Apache nginx or

00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:21,529
Lightspeed to be honest it doesn't

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,119
really matter but if you choose Apache

00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:25,579
you're probably gonna have less problems

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,680
if you're the one actually having to

00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:29,209
maintain it nginx

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,729
it's the new kid on the block that's

00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:33,289
taken over but all the old development

00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:35,869
has all been done against Apache over

00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:37,789
testing all that htaccess stuff it's all

00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:40,459
Apache nginx

00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:43,459
is gives great a visit University get

00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:45,229
more bang for your buck Lightspeed

00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:46,609
some people love that but others say

00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:51,709
that it's no better than the other two

00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:54,170
and the other two are free okay really

00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:57,499
small common questions should I buy my

00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:01,359
domain name from my host nope nope

00:36:57,499 --> 00:37:01,359
because they can hold you to answer

00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:08,150
should you have email on your server no

00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:10,249
definitely not because it can become and

00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,109
I'm saying nightmare yeah

00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:15,799
there's four or five different ones are

00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:17,209
really good SendGrid mandrel mailgun you

00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,869
name it there's other us it will send

00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:21,890
emails for you

00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:22,969
and they have a better capability than

00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,219
you to make sure I gets delivered

00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:26,630
because all of their sending servers

00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:30,109
have been recognized for a much longer

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:32,869
time should I get an SSL certificate

00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:35,900
from my host well I'm gonna say yeah

00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:37,640
because otherwise you have to go and get

00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,769
all sorts of things sorted out from them

00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,869
go and do all sorts of man-in-the-middle

00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:42,700
 that you don't

00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:46,390
being involved in it's just let them do

00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,460
it should I buy a CDN or host of a CDN

00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,829
maybe we'll come onto that bit more in a

00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:52,779
minute I shall use a web application

00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:55,690
father yeah anything you can do to

00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:59,559
increase security is good thing okay

00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:01,599
Sidious why user reduces the overall

00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:04,930
traffic because your site files your

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,029
images goes another thing and yeah

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:10,930
hopefully it puts bits and bytes closer

00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:13,450
to the user not always true possibility

00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:16,119
of added security like CloudFlare puts

00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,720
their IP address into the show us your

00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,269
servers IP addresses hard to be here

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,519
possible Bennett NS but you've always

00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:27,220
gonna check for your customers are for

00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,380
example I was a patient before RW has

00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,900
global customer base and they already

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,880
had see the info America plane is part

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,579
of the process you need to look

00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,660
somewhere else and yeah sometimes a CDN

00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:44,140
that slow things down if I'm sorry two

00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:46,660
minutes if your customers are in let's

00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:49,900
say Amsterdam and you're Syrians in

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,220
Germany then clearly if your hosting was

00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,999
also in the Netherlands it be faster

00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,170
Jessica about your hosting okay anybody

00:38:54,999 --> 00:39:00,150
here do a China

00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:04,569
then I shall skip this one cuz my volved

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:06,789
quickly GPR everybody's got a processing

00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:07,599
agreement make sure that you understand

00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:10,210
it

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,339
I personally set up my time to forget

00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,859
for when somebody asked to be removed to

00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:16,930
be the equal of the backup retention

00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:18,400
periods also considering where your

00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,160
hosts because the NSA can touch you if

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,349
you're anywhere in America so that can

00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,119
be a problem if you're an NGO that those

00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:30,099
kinds of governments avoids ew g

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,470
companies there's a full list just avoid

00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:37,420
them american dumpster fire as they like

00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:41,559
to call it they have a very long history

00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:43,930
of buying good companies taking away all

00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,640
of their funding and not upgrading

00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:51,039
anything and having

00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:52,329
very poor support and they do this time

00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,859
and time again but they're a

00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,440
billion-dollar company so they keep on

00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:58,599
buying up more and more MORE

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,809
okay thanks for listening you can find
