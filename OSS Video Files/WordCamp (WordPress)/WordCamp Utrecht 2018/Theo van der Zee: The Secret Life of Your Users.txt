Title: Theo van der Zee: The Secret Life of Your Users
Publication date: 2020-04-04
Playlist: WordCamp Utrecht 2018
Description: 
	The average conversion rate of a website is only 2%. Do you know why the other 98% of your visitors didnâ€™t convert? Do you even know what made the 2% convert with you instead of your competitors? Getting answers to the questions above is one of the key aspects needed to increase your conversion rates. But how can you get these questions answered?
In this talk, I will explain three methods to help you with this. For each method, estimated time/cost, suggested tools and recommended tasks/questions will be provided to help you get the most out of your research efforts.

kind of annoying right when people

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,980
arrive and they leave without telling

00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,510
you why that's exactly the most of your

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,019
business on your websites are doing as

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:29,960
well I'm gonna try to help you find the

00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:31,910
ways in which you can learn about why

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,489
they are using or stop them from leaving

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:39,589
it I feel this is shorter longer

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:42,229
introduction of myself

00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:44,180
I love optimizing things including

00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:47,000
websites which happen to program for my

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,890
life not I was born and bred in Holland

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,629
I love going to the beach yeah that

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,180
would come there as often as I'd like I

00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:56,900
have a master's degree in psychology I

00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,610
like doing talks talks ago someone

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,650
reminded me you guys wearing the exact

00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,040
same clothes I was so bad photo but

00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,830
luckily I'm not this time

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,840
and I've been working on a company

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,760
myself that's related what I'm talking

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,800
about today it's called user feedback

00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,390
and it allows you to get feedback from

00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,550
your clients which will give you

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,130
recurring company recurring revenue for

00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,260
your own company you can send up really

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,480
fast you can try it out fire this link

00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,510
and I will show again at the end of the

00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:30,080
presentation engage and you might be

00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:32,090
interest so what's the relevance of my

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,280
thoughts today well I think this chart

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,640
pretty much shows the relevance of my

00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,890
talk the average conversion rate of a

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,650
website is about two percent which means

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,930
that of all the 100 visitors that you

00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,680
get on your website about two percent do

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,409
what you want

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,510
which might be get a lead subscription

00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:54,440
or purchase something or give a donation

00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,880
or get hosting or contact you and the

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,870
other 98%

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:05,049
leave for whatever reason without doing

00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:08,509
what you want them to do the lack of

00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:12,440
knowing what your users want results in

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,580
high bounce rates bounce rate is a

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,730
pretty

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,330
this metric is not really clear what

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,070
defines someone who balances or not

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,710
Google Analytics which is probably what

00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,480
most if not all of you are using has

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,640
their own definition of what a balance

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,860
is they basically say someone that

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,770
arrives on the website does something

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,300
except for clicking and leaves which is

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,310
really weird because of someone arrives

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,960
on your website with a blog for over an

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,600
hour discuss it with all their

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,110
co-workers not clicks anywhere and

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,780
leaves they decide they are labeled as a

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:53,090
bouncer which to most people is like a

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:55,010
failed visit that discussion aside I

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,200
bounce rates however you might define

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,970
them are unwanted because these are

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,640
visitors that arrive on your page

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,400
through labor of your own perhaps even

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,040
true funding of your own buy a hat or

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,040
dismay or whatever way and they leave

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,020
they don't like bounce bounce cost a lot

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,000
of money then basically brings nothing

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:19,489
to the table except for knowing that not

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,530
every moment of your life another

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,330
downside not knowing what your visitors

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,400
wants is that they will probably have a

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,930
lot of diamond sight if you're not

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,120
serving the content that they want to

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,620
read or you're not reaching them in a

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,030
way that connects with them or you're

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,040
not building enough trust in the way

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,360
that your website con design to build or

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,430
settle or whatever they might just leave

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,370
nothing a lot of time on site will

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,890
probably result in a few people extra

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,070
good what you want them to and you can

00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,380
use this as like a proxy metric to see

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,420
our people increasingly staying on my

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,300
website for our hedges leaving widget

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,820
fast and that might well be

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,950
of them not finding what they were it's

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,350
actually extended version of this one if

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,510
people will bounce they will leave

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,310
really fast and if they like it a little

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:11,340
bit but still leave they will probably

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,450
you still have a lot of time inside a

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,550
metric that is getting more and more

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,610
related to their user experience on your

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:21,459
website or not knowing what your

00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,380
visitors voluntour serving content that

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,370
doesn't suit them well are bad as your

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,950
rankings with recent algorithm updates

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,590
Google is attaching more and more value

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:36,130
to being able to serve the right

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,080
experience to users simply put the

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,640
better your website is and it's judged

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:46,080
by the experts in Google's panel the

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,520
better your website will start ranking

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,650
Google is turning more and more into the

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,450
black box so they can't really say

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,600
anymore like it's a one-percenter thing

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,980
or it's a contribution thing basically

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,110
they are saying if your user experience

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,660
is bad it will cost you in terms of SEO

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,400
and how much it will cost to respond

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,340
from black box and for some sites in

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,080
Google's will you badly and more whereas

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,669
you make it on your website the more it

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,450
will impact either positively or

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:15,520
negatively etc just something to keep in

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,030
mind user experience is not just a

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,530
conversion rate thing anymore it's also

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:25,900
related as you're more more these days

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,210
by the way the talk is short ish in

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,480
terms of time that I have available so

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,820
if during something that I say a

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:39,010
question arises just raise your hand

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:40,770
that I will just answer it but something

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,080
more complicated in my head when I

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:47,710
placed it there in terms of learning

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,540
about you users there are probably

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,330
hundreds of ways of doing this but I

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:56,260
just try to figure out a way to make it

00:05:52,330 --> 00:06:00,310
as flat and as easy as possible to find

00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,740
out how you could do this so probably

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,229
the easiest way to learn more about

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,940
your website is to an extra 20 just ask

00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,039
someone there's a lots of experience

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,349
with how website should reveal how they

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,509
can be optimized and ask them what

00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:15,759
should I do better it's not the best way

00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:18,099
like it would be one opinion against the

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,539
other ones but it's better than not

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,400
looking at your website and just

00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,770
assuming your developer knows how to

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,039
build a website properly that fits

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,949
reader uses desires that it's optimized

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,720
for speed etc get some of the look at it

00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:37,180
and that will probably become a better

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:39,789
web then there is the one on top it's

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,009
heavy testing it's often associated with

00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,289
coverage rate optimisation if you ask

00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,440
someone hey what do you think someone in

00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:50,680
conversion rate optimisation does they

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,530
all really reply something close to a be

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,659
testing I'm not sure how much if you

00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:01,690
have actually done any a bit testing in

00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:03,220
the past one two maybe three months so I

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,560
will give a short explanation of what

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,300
this is just to give you an idea maybe

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,250
testing is basically comparing two

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,530
versions of a website and seeing which

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,909
one performs better say this is for any

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:18,430
type of website and this is version B we

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:20,949
will show this version of website to

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,190
half of our users and the other version

00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:26,680
of website to give other 50% and we'll

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,860
just see which one gets more clicks for

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,479
more sales form or whatever and we call

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,280
that one the winner and we put it life

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,490
and then we assume our conversion rate

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,949
went up and we get more paying visitors

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,650
out of the same amount of visitors that

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,919
we get on our website this is pretty

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:47,650
difficult I've lost a lot of development

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:51,729
often equivalent of statistical analysis

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,889
of which version was better it's not the

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,509
easiest thing to do and therefore I will

00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,460
put it on top of the pyramid after

00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,409
you've already learned a lot of blocks

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,449
from an expert after you get what we

00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:03,880
will talk about in this presentation and

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:06,159
it then it might be a good idea to start

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,780
a be testing your findings but you will

00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,920
also need a lot of traffic you will

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,720
probably need an extra

00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,390
set this up for you and keep building

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,520
these desks for you it's interesting

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,770
especially for large companies but for

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,870
the smaller ones I would advise against

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,540
it until you have the rest set up very

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,960
well so we will focus on the center of

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,600
the pyramids used in sites basically

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,400
this is the dilemma of most of what

00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,980
we'll be talking about today should you

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,760
do it yourself or let others do it of

00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,890
course

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,380
hundreds of parameters that you can take

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,790
into account resources your own time how

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,370
much money you have whether you spend

00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:45,820
your own money or your boss's money how

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,680
much experience you have etc I just

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,510
tried to make it as plain as possible

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,670
black and white decision yes do it

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,320
yourself that others do it take your own

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,960
parameters into account to making the

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,970
decision I would just recommend it from

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,620
my helicopter perspective of what I

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,240
think would be probably the right

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,880
decision for most people in a situation

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,370
will be comparing apples to well oranges

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:16,390
apples a pair of the fight wasn't black

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:20,230
before so apples and oranges list will

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:22,510
be discussing these three forms of user

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,030
insights generation in this presentation

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,130
I just translated the whole back to

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,730
English during the previous talk so I

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,040
hope I didn't miss anything the amount

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,130
of insights you get are on that y-axis

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,900
and the difficulty that is to set up or

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:43,300
get going or analyze his on the x-axis

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:46,120
the size of the bubble is the amount of

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,840
costs that it brings with so it's

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,120
actually a three parameter chart that I

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,940
said

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,780
user recordings which we'll discuss in

00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:00,420
detail after this light are the cheapest

00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,010
one in generally it is the easiest one

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,130
and probably generates additional

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,500
insights user input one in between

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,440
slightly markers light inside site more

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,660
difficulty user testing on the ends most

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:18,900
difficult thing of insights by far most

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:20,580
cost so use recordings use input user

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,090
testing will start with observe

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,750
recordings this kind of tools that you

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,660
can use to set up your recordings

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,460
personally a big fan of both jar I see

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,220
two people nodding so that's follow fan

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,780
the multi as well but just not the only

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,390
tool and it's probably not the best one

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,120
for everyone so if you're considering

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,160
doing user recordings at least try to

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,330
have a short look at the other ones as

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,040
well despite the fact that both will

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:54,090
probably be the best solution but that's

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,640
a bit unfair to the other providers for

00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,910
this one I would say do it yourself at

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,680
least together hang of it just try to do

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,630
it yourself at first before you start

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,790
outsourcing it to underscore to other

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,400
companies

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:13,710
how does this look like this is a

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,690
screenshot phone recordings and when you

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,060
click it you end up in this overview

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,910
what you see here are recordings of

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,530
people that have visited the website for

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,780
people that have never seen this it can

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,000
probably be a bit creepy and it might be

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,260
a good time to install adblocker if this

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,170
is something that bothers you

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,090
if you visit a website and this is many

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,550
websites these days they will track your

00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,350
mouse movements and before deed if you

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,680
are actually look what you type into

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:44,340
every form field as well and these days

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:47,190
your type stuff is must because well GDP

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,290
are very nice seeing all the data in

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,150
their profiles

00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,030
what you can see is literally people

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,730
that move their mouse around on page

00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,910
click somewhere somewhere else navigate

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,650
a bit there click a bit there and on the

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,410
bottom you can see the red dots are

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,870
clicks and what's something about the

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,920
yellow dots but I never really got the

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,420
difference between the red ones and the

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,960
other ones something happens when

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:15,000
there's ago you can see for each of the

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,080
visitors that visit your website and

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,030
that are locked

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,040
some people use have longer so people

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,450
using compatible browsers that probably

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,120
some reasons what people don't show up

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,610
the ones that do show up after own row

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,110
and some specs about when the visitors

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:33,960
how long make this event which page is

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:36,360
interested that's ever if there's enough

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,670
time left at the end of my regular site

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,860
that I will do a short demonstration on

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,720
each of the methods but for now I will

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,270
just run through so that we at least can

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:51,810
cover them all before I start demoing

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:55,050
one and not be able to show you I tried

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:59,250
to list some skills that are related to

00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,410
doing news recordings it's not

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,330
research-based is it just me thinking

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,250
about what does it involve to the user

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,670
recordings and I basically ended up this

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,900
the big one is patience in this one this

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,350
list is endless

00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,270
if you have lots of visitors basically

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,510
the list generate far faster than you

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:21,210
can see the recordings yourself so you

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,370
might have entering filtering and or

00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,110
tagging pages or just watching the

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,050
longest ones or the ones that we should

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,550
check out there's lots of ways to

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,410
optimize this process but in general

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,830
it's a process that requires a lot of

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,380
patience also you should pay attention

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,850
because it's often in the details where

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,380
people are clicking somewhere that they

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,760
shouldn't or they're navigating to a

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:47,430
base at a student yeah I guess that's it

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,730
also and the tie thing is a big one for

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:53,160
this because you can find out why you

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,320
can see them scrolling see them going

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,870
back and forth who pays or you can see

00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,220
them clicking somewhere and then waiting

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,509
with the mouse bit in the net

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,579
getting somewhere else but you don't

00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,839
know whether they're kept just walked

00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:09,569
over the keyboard or they were actually

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:15,240
considering some deeper thoughts about

00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:18,600
why they were moving their eyes once

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,279
again not super research-based basically

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,079
for my own interest there will be a

00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,449
summary one at the end so you don't have

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,360
to take orders of these ones you can

00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:30,540
just have a summary view of different

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,750
two types at the end to see a general

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,589
overview of how much money time and

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:40,230
learnings are generated protested

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:42,660
because hope jar is free until a limited

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,029
point you could say the costs are zero

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,980
of course as labor costs if you do this

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,230
yourself is far more than zero but

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,209
there's not an actual money that needs

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,350
to be handed to someone else in order to

00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:57,540
do use recordings depending on how long

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,790
the videos are there to watch you could

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,430
think about maybe two minutes per tester

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,860
and I was generous in my less than one

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,199
protestor because it can often take up

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,839
to 10 20 30 videos until you see

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,129
something new or you can figure out what

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,230
people were doing when they clicked

00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:18,809
somewhere because it's so that's ducted

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,370
to find out what people might have been

00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:24,930
doing when they little did not click

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:28,759
somewhere the next one the middle circle

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:30,990
in the overview chart is user input

00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,089
there are several companies that you can

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,399
use for this I put my own in as well

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:39,540
because it relates to this but of course

00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:42,870
I wouldn't sell stock so to verify the

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,879
other alternatives in as well I would

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,889
say I'll towards it but I think this

00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,930
closest one this one is pretty much in

00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:50,939
the middle you could do this yourself if

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,250
you take the time to learn how to face

00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:56,459
the questions right and if you find ways

00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:58,350
to recruit people but I'm leaning

00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,540
towards that folder to it because

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,300
basically your own hourly rate is way

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,800
too high compared to being able to do to

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,329
outsource this to others who can

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,709
probably do this far more cheaply than

00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:10,079
you can

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:13,620
but it's the most on the fence one of

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,300
the ones that we're discussing for

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,769
instance this is usability hub this is

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,199
one of the other two companies I showed

00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,329
on the previous slide and what they were

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,790
basically allow it to do is to set up a

00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:27,689
desk for instance if you want to learn

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:30,170
about trustworthiness of your website

00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:32,370
you can set up a test you can name it

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,279
example.org trustworthiness

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,559
research you can select English or Dutch

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,679
as language the site when you want to

00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,559
use a welcome screen or not and just

00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:46,500
keep adding sections to the questions

00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:49,410
that you want to ask the more questions

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,300
you ask the higher courses and it also

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,459
depends on which apply you used some

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,600
have fixed costs on seven six numbers of

00:16:53,459 --> 00:17:00,839
questions that you can ask etc after you

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:05,220
finish this questionnaire you can put it

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:09,059
life and people can be able lots of new

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,919
friends and people will be recruited

00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,350
from either their own panel or from your

00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,449
panel and you can have these people ask

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:18,299
your question answer your questions that

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:20,039
you have about website for instance this

00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,740
is a screenshot from the feedback you

00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,720
would get for my own service I asked

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,669
people through a similar set up a

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,760
question does the page look trustworthy

00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:31,770
or not and why I use MailChimp as an

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,890
example here I'm not sure if that's in

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,860
some work now so these are responses

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,870
from people in an online panel who gave

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,940
answers while looking at the middle team

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,970
page about whether or not they found the

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,460
base we trustworthy and from this

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,200
feedback you can get written reasons on

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,559
why these people figured

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,780
debate was or was not trust

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,520
for instance very much so looks

00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,500
authentic and genuine the client

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,299
reference that appears below as you keep

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,679
scrolling the page also add some it's a

00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:06,020
penalty on the page there was a client's

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,030
case study principle of like a

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,890
well-known client that was praising

00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,080
MailChimp and its services and this

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,530
tester referred to the client reference

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,120
as being enough for the booster so for

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,220
instance if you're looking to increase

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,470
the church weariness of your website you

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,179
might consider running an a/b test that

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,490
features more of these client

00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:28,070
testimonials on the home page testing is

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,840
effort to improve Authority or to

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:34,760
improve the social proof that you have

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,640
other skills that are related to doing

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,429
the user input way of gathering the

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,980
feedback it's a lot of empathizing as

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,660
you can see that people are more vocal

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,150
and what they mean in what they want

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,210
it's not just clicks or no clicks but

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,580
it's it takes some effort between the

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,980
lines when someone says oh I really like

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,510
interface though it looks a bit dark to

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,660
my preference and maybe you could add

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,490
support it still still fade but you can

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,290
form what you know about your own

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,150
website or the sides of your clients

00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,160
will probably be enough if someone just

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,290
starts describing it as dark or a lot of

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,620
people start describing in this dark you

00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:15,500
might be like yeah cut this dark ish

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,240
flavor over it I might try to brighten

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,799
it up a bit

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,890
do keep in mind that it is still

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,140
subjective feedback there's no maybe

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,900
testing going on yet it's just people

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,150
thinking things about your website which

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,290
as a matter of fact is most of what user

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:37,730
insights gather is and what you might

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:39,799
consider a deep testing after you garlic

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,960
your feedback you can see whether or not

00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:45,820
that actually works the way that people

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,820
set they fought in mind

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,089
[Music]

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,340
in a way you could but how would you get

00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,010
people to fill it in like you would need

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:07,040
a panel of people to actually do the

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,870
surprise for you I want to use a gravity

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,060
form this would have to be visitors that

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,890
are actually on your website already so

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,600
you wouldn't get feedback from the

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:19,540
outside but you will get feedback from

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,540
the actual visitor does that make sense

00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,530
with most of the tools the ones that

00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,900
I've listed on the screen and they have

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,060
their own battles so basically these are

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,970
just people doing small tasks for

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,860
payment like for instance rate weather

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,170
this image contains a rabbit enough that

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,970
could be a task they're doing and please

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,010
give feedback on this website will be

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,089
another task

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,089
[Music]

00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:01,320
they're different services for instance

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:05,880
with OTR you can also do similar types

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:08,640
of research with polls and these are the

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,560
small MSN Messenger light poles that pop

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,240
up and they have food I came like

00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,240
participate or we have just a short

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,760
question that we might want to answer

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,670
with the user methods churches please

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,470
please use external panels so you don't

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,180
have to recruit your own testers but

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,480
they were recruiting for you in your

00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,630
target demographics and get your

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,830
questions answered based on that

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,900
especially for websites that have low

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,030
traffic this is like a must because

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,190
otherwise that twenty people that might

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,960
visit your website today will all have

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,410
to answer these questions within never

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,390
will

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:46,250
to get the decent amount of feedback

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,250
within a reasonable amount of time

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,020
so empathizing asking questions

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,420
setting up tasks depending on how to

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:58,520
structure their inputs reporting logical

00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:01,320
thinking moving about 5 euros per tester

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,480
about five minutes protester and want

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,500
real earnings per tester once again

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,070
Rousseff on the heart site last one and

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,620
this is the one that people usually pick

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,990
though it's hard mode difficult one to

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,320
get set up and even more by far the most

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,420
expensive companies that offer this user

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,790
testing really enterprise these days

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,590
unless you have thousands of dollars but

00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,910
they probably won't even answer your

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,890
emails I discovered couple months ago

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:34,590
what users do used to be a really good

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,840
solution until they got bought by like

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:40,950
this giant and I'm afraid they won't

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,350
answer my emails anymore as well I think

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,130
this is the one I would recommend

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,269
especially if you're looking for ducks

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,609
testers I don't think they

00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:52,989
Dutch testers unless you earn their

00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:54,909
enterprise Premium Plus package and user

00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:56,229
feel as a really new one I think use

00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,779
that myself but their website look

00:22:56,229 --> 00:23:01,389
really good and they seem to be annoying

00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:04,479
about it doing very well so that might

00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:06,519
be worth checking out this one this one

00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:08,859
for me would definitely fall on the

00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:11,409
leather let's do it as you can see in a

00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:13,779
later slide you're paying up to $100 per

00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:15,879
tester and so you really want to utilize

00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:17,950
them well and not ask them questions

00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:19,869
which they don't know how to answer or

00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:23,169
they answer in church raising they don't

00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:23,679
help you of course you can do this

00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,359
yourself

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,859
but because of the pricing of the

00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,599
testers and the amount of time that it

00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,479
takes you set it up and analyze or

00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,339
really recommend letting others to do it

00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:35,529
and how does this look like well this is

00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:38,619
an overview I used what use do for this

00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:42,759
and you simply get a list of people with

00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:46,059
some stats about an agenda the devices

00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:49,450
that were using you can just click on

00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:52,929
video and you will just see a video of

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:55,329
that navigating on your website much

00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:57,639
like with the user record it's a whole

00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:59,589
chart but with volterra you don't know

00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:01,269
why because you can't hear the people

00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:04,419
talking you don't know what they do or

00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:06,489
why and with services like user to use

00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:09,039
testing what you do you can actually ask

00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:10,450
them questions or let them form dust for

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,279
instance it does what's the first

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,499
impression of this webpage what is this

00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,690
page for and you can just hear the

00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:18,549
people talking like whether they say oh

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:21,429
wow I didn't know I can click that

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:23,679
button or did you know that demos

00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:26,079
website X or Y that also has a similar

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,579
design but they have this pop up in the

00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,669
bottom and it really helps me to

00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:33,639
navigate the website you will probably

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:36,009
get a ton of insights if you know how to

00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:39,190
phrase the tasks and face the questions

00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:42,669
well get people thinking and there's

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,440
always the proverbial rotten apple in

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:46,659
there I will just rush through the tasks

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,849
in three point four minutes and once

00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:52,509
the questions as shortly as they can but

00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:55,960
you can just write them no me no give

00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:57,789
them a low rating and if their service

00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,440
is well they will probably supply with a

00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:04,019
new tester because they don't want to be

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,609
associated with bad - bad testers anyway

00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,529
this one probably takes you to more

00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:10,450
patients than user testing because if

00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:12,190
you set up your past well people might

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,609
spend up to half an hour searching on

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,470
your website talking and I've even had

00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:18,669
some ones with bad microphones where you

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,529
have to turn up the volume off your

00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:22,599
computer to get absolute maximum and

00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:26,590
then your some faint whisper in the end

00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:29,409
of you are here buts and some testers

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:31,659
are amazing I've also had tester step I

00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:33,639
would really want to meet the person and

00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:36,669
just ask them about the website more

00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:38,619
about the process more I never very

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,479
vocal about things they fought about the

00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:44,109
website and different IDs they had about

00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:46,389
it and it makes back but that's mostly

00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:48,729
with the user input as well so feedback

00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:50,200
is great and some people yeah they're

00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:52,330
just rushing through to make some money

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,669
I really I can't blame them in a way

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,879
it's not the best way to us to do this

00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:59,169
testing from the other end of the line

00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:00,940
but then again they're getting paid for

00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:04,690
something at least try to offer some

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:11,649
value then again well for fighting as

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:14,609
mix back so I guess cost a tester but it

00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:19,149
yours really depends on the amount of

00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:24,700
specific specificity that you want if

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:27,669
you want Flemish Belgian car buyers

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,649
between the age of 25 and 30 that have

00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,960
bought a Volvo in the last half year

00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:34,809
that will really ramp up your

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,869
recruitment cost and might be up to 500

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,820
euros per tester especially if you need

00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:43,509
recruitment agencies to find these guys

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,639
it will even be more expensive I say 50

00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:48,169
euros per tester is about average of

00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:51,470
please get me a male or female

00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:53,989
from moment or give me someone under 40

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,629
from France I would say that would be

00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:58,909
the average cost Podesta if they have to

00:26:56,629 --> 00:27:02,269
use any devices altogether laptop or

00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:04,340
desktop tablet or mobile across most of

00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:06,379
the ramp up to a hundred euros Podesta

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,179
because they're just a smaller sample of

00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:11,659
people that are doing the testing on

00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:13,820
these devices time protester it's a

00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:16,369
tough tough one to find out because

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,549
often even setting up these fast cost

00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:21,529
multiple hours per campaign so that

00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:22,850
would really ramp up the time the tester

00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:24,590
especially because you're already

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,409
listening half an hour to what they are

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:30,259
having to say then again the reward can

00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:33,049
be really high from sometimes from two

00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:35,899
or three user testers you can really get

00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:38,600
a lot inside foolproof your website up

00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:40,730
to 5 10 sometimes even 20 learnings

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,850
protester then again there's these bad

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:46,070
apples with zero or two and these are

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:54,100
really expensive findings if you have a

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:58,549
lot of these in your sample so directly

00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,749
this to me caps just trying to use fancy

00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,749
words to make me sound smart

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:25,440
I was lying made herself and then it

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:28,270
wasn't I'll do it on top of my head

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,070
for instance when you're looking at

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,070
ancient what your website

00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,480
[Music]

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,490
for instance when we would have user

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:46,440
tests to look at this website and we've

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:49,060
asked them please pretend that you're

00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,330
aspiring blogger that wants to start

00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:57,340
blogging today a fine way to sign up for

00:28:52,330 --> 00:29:03,880
the surface and see what you want looks

00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:05,770
are smarter might be one of the findings

00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,960
that the test might be you would be the

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,030
C term like surfing off your website it

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,030
would be the interesting website and

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,040
that's a good visual on it and a while

00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,950
and really confuse and do have a company

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,230
but also on the blog which doesn't

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,150
really click that would be something you

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,890
would hear them say like they would be

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,550
like going back and forth with their

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,870
mouths and like talking to you like I

00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:31,300
hope you really want to have a different

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:33,790
way to like separate myself like yes I

00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,110
want God but I'm also a company like is

00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,570
there some way to like rephrase that

00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,190
button and then just move on they click

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,900
one or two the two of the buttons and

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:45,100
they'd be like okay well I'll just

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,630
pretend I'm a company I really miss the

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,850
red button over here I figured that

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,860
would be my next step and that would be

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,840
like feedback for you tonight consider

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,640
once again should they be tested to

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,500
shoot maybe does everything that's not

00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,760
possible so you just try to do your best

00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:04,120
gas - for instance put blah sorry a

00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,540
button here that says start your company

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,880
blog now you could consider that that's

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,640
in boot for next IP tasks or adequately

00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,810
in like hey yeah Bri you make sense to

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,240
have a button there as well

00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,610
for instance if people are landing there

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,970
from AdWords you could consider I think

00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,970
about

00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,759
[Music]

00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:56,080
I want the user testing like the the

00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:58,450
requesting side of things for a mortgage

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,610
provider and people were literally

00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:04,299
skimming over questions and cost of like

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:07,179
five thousand euros he's being a big yes

00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:08,980
please have no one would do that make a

00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:11,080
decision these not the target audience

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,059
they would really think of the decision

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,110
said because of thousands of euros and

00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:18,700
you thank you no I don't think it works

00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,580
for all types of companies but

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,960
particularly when you're doing like

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,600
inside finding when you're just trying

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,280
to figure out what might work it really

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,230
helps you get inspiration even from

00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,480
people that aren't necessarily in the

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,120
mortgage buying market they will also

00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,650
find a part to be website that simply

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,070
don't work questions that aren't

00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:41,049
answered even when you're pretending to

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,850
get a new mortgage you think of more

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:53,110
questions than you as a developer or

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:55,590
builder marketer and probably any other

00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,590
questions

00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,679
give me some ideas of what difficult

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,730
findings you can get from the different

00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:09,400
three different strategies

00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:21,460
yes I will get my presentation back on

00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:23,050
the screen the the thing is with user

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,700
recordings you would really have to

00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,830
figure out what is happening yourself

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,330
because the people aren't talking to you

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,120
in any written way you will have to

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,340
interpret what they're doing as working

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,320
or not working so for instance if

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,910
someone clicks a button and they click

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,710
it back and they click it fork and they

00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,900
click it back what were they thinking

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,210
like where they confused about what

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:47,350
place they were landing did they expect

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,910
another page to note just about slip and

00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,500
did they click the Run button and did

00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,390
they figure out well I should've been

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,280
here in the first place there's a lot of

00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,800
interpreting with the usual recordings

00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,500
well if you really want to you could

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,660
even print an edible and a whole chart

00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,520
pull on a page that costs a lot of

00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,350
clicking back and forth and get written

00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,910
feedback based on that so the whole

00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,490
charge suite for instance would allow

00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,890
you to get the why behind the actions as

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,929
well so this one is mostly what people

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:17,350
are clicking somewhere why you don't

00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:19,300
know just interpret it is for most

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:24,400
companies this is written feedback so

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:26,410
just the ones that I show you the level

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,140
of feedback you get is really depend

00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,820
upon our type of questions you praise on

00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,840
the way you phrase the question

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:37,930
the way that you recruit your panel on

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,300
the people you select in your panel I've

00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:44,530
also seen I was just looking to results

00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,820
of this one I use the server before when

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,430
I didn't have a lot of experience with

00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:51,970
usability testing myself many answers

00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:55,060
were just yes/no left different colors

00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:56,380
it it makes no sense like I can't make

00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,660
sense of someone that tries different

00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,300
colors as a way to improve a certain

00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,980
webpage so what you would like is

00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,780
something like this of course I've

00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,610
pasted it the best possible slide that I

00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:10,000
have with everyone writing super

00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:11,650
constructive useful feedback but if you

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,600
sell them right you can get something

00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,360
similar like with people using full

00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,200
sentences and dots between lines and

00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,390
capitals and stuff it's amazing how some

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,640
people deliver their feedback getting

00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:26,080
full caps with exclamation marks in

00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,450
between and just writing nice things

00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:33,730
with probably got a capsule or something

00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:35,590
so this is an indication of the level

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,810
that you would get from a written

00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:41,200
feedback and the one that you get from

00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:42,940
the user recording it's really like the

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,610
most complete experience probably and

00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,830
yes you pay dearly for it but it's the

00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,780
most complete thing there's an even user

00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:51,400
testing that also has facial feedback so

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,400
they activate webcam and you can

00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,560
actually see people are trying to click

00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,750
somewhere or amazement when it doesn't

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,250
work or take bond or anger then they try

00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:03,610
to pick about these seven lines and it

00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,560
simply refuses to do what they want of

00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,840
course more features one the highly paid

00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:12,970
tester so yeah that's really up to you

00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,350
how immersive you want feedback to me in

00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,180
that sense this one's really complete

00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:18,940
because you simply got someone talking

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:23,960
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:32,270
your product then again that make sense

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:36,650
so in start I promised you like an

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:39,200
overview of well the three big clusters

00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,540
of ways that you can use to get feedback

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,490
on your website gospel tester time to

00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,340
dance the lyrics protester and I simply

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:49,370
outlined them in terms of wedge opinion

00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,560
once again all everything you see you

00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:54,560
this is an estimate probably not too far

00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,450
off but your own experience might vary

00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,610
based on your own musicians what you

00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:04,850
want are there any questions and second

00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:06,970
question how much time drivers give or

00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,970
take

00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:26,559
a good one the question was do you need

00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:29,109
any special privacy statement on your

00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,849
website that you're using hot char off

00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:33,339
the GR off jar

00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:36,130
they became fine bit nicer than they

00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:37,450
were before you company but they were

00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,759
collecting quite a bit of daytime

00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,640
visitors before right now they're

00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:46,599
masking whatever you type because it

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:50,469
might be privacy sensitive and they also

00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,569
mask IP addresses by default so what you

00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:55,529
do need some kind of cookie warning you

00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:58,269
don't need extreme marketing cross

00:36:55,529 --> 00:37:00,279
website stuff that you might need for

00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:03,519
instance for double-click or for other

00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:05,469
Cross website crackers so you would

00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,019
prove that and personally I think it

00:37:05,469 --> 00:37:11,859
falls on the statistical cookies but if

00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:14,109
you have like similar like I think it

00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:16,930
falls under the similar tick mark as

00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:20,799
analytics like you're using most of the

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:22,719
day that is aggregated and if there is

00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:24,219
individual day that you only can you see

00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,569
you moving them they're moving a mouse

00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:28,119
around and obviously that's not a

00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:29,739
privacy concern at least for legal

00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,049
standpoint can imagine that people won't

00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:34,660
like it developing them in their face

00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:36,700
like yes we will track every centimeter

00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,710
that your mouse moves a very click but

00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,259
from a legal standpoint another privacy

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,299
sensitive piece of data so yes you know

00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,309
you would need to have somebody privacy

00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:46,599
statement but not in the extreme ticks

00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:50,729
that you might be friends is for

00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,729
double-click or retargeting or section

00:37:53,510 --> 00:38:07,800
yes yes thank you for both the second

00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,990
and the third wall don't have to be

00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,790
implemented at all these are external so

00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:16,110
they will own every type of website for

00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:18,270
every server language that you use word

00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,470
but Joomla Drupal wakes doesn't matter

00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,780
can handle anything

00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:27,570
a seasoned out it was not a giant

00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:30,390
expected yes and first well the book jar

00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:37,590
or similar ones probably gdm is the best

00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:43,620
and easiest solution yes yes but google

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:45,420
optimized is an a/b testing solution so

00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:47,700
it falls in the top um actually

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,140
comparing whether or not the solution

00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,440
that you might think works better or

00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:56,030
worse but this does not apply to the

00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,030
bottom two that I mentioned

00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,270
if I have to put price technology

00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,770
testing I've got to ask that on some

00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,900
other place that would be thousand euros

00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:11,220
quick test easily great all the

00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,520
knowledge that you just acquired from

00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:37,350
people with healthy hourly rates and

00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:39,750
stuff that's yes high quality mostly

00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:44,460
comes in in this part in the tasks set

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:46,650
up you try to figure out whether people

00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,260
are thinking and the way in which they

00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:53,910
instructed at tasks and learn and you

00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:56,100
just try to figure out the best way to

00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,110
ask them what you want to know and set

00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:02,280
up tasks in a way that my bestie done

00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:03,870
and afterwards when you have like the

00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,020
results for instance when you're

00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:08,580
watching a video like this do you stop

00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,160
that popping up in half and so on it's

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:16,110
like wow if this works I could really

00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:18,270
use some trust indicators and the

00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,670
psychology part pops up it's a sakal we

00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:23,000
can use social proof or we can use some

00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:26,580
other stuff mr. Kildee I wrote this book

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,130
just it's weird is it

00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:33,210
I have personally for me it's a big

00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:36,360
system like all in ones but if you would

00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,830
do with a separate ways to activate it

00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,690
it would really be like when

00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:43,280
interpreting the data or and setting it

00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:49,170
up so yeah basically in that process a

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:53,220
lot of questions no more questions

00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:57,569
that like this another president Park to

00:40:53,220 --> 00:41:00,210
myself thanks your attention if there's

00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:04,859
any questions afterwards - three - three

00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:07,549
- you know or your business cards or

00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,549
anything else

00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,510
we're gonna take a few minutes to set up

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:18,440
the next speaker so take a walk

00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,440
