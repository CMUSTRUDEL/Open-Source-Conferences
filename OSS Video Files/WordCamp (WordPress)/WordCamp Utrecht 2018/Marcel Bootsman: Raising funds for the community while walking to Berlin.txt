beragon folder and told in there in the

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,250
presentation if you have big plans you

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,619
have to take small steps and I'm gonna

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,609
take a lot of small steps in May next

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:31,299
year and I will tell you more about this

00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm gonna tell a bit about myself and

00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:37,429
before I'm gonna tell something about

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,049
myself I want you to reach out to your

00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:42,409
phone and see if you have a QR code

00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:45,380
scanner on it and try and scan this QR

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,570
code and it's also on that side no

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,850
worries there's nothing scary gonna

00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,299
happen but if you use it QR code you can

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:57,200
donate money to the good cause that I'm

00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:58,490
gonna walk for next year that QR code

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,289
will be there during the whole

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,749
presentation I only had it up on the

00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:03,859
last slide before I got up on stage and

00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:06,109
I thought I'm gonna put it on every

00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:09,200
slide so everybody has time to use that

00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:12,680
QR code and maybe donate some money so

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,260
that's that's that s car I already said

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,319
I'm the owner of most romo don't NL

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,120
officially it's a wordpress agency on my

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,890
own

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,010
together with a lot of people and build

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,980
amazing things and support my customers

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,959
in that I do everything in that business

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,900
I'm a business owner development a

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,310
developer project manager treasurer and

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,319
well every other role you can imagine

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,230
that that's there in a company I try to

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:42,280
do it myself for the WordPress community

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:45,849
I have done a lot and I'm still doing a

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,700
lot and sometimes I tend to accept a lot

00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,290
of voluntary business and I want to help

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,340
out and I know because it gives me

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,799
energy

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,840
but taking too much is gonna drain your

00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:59,470
energy so I had to take some step back

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,599
at some times and then another word camp

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,519
came along and just had to involve get

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,359
involved and I will help organize it

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,250
again so I'm very bad in saying no but

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:11,109
sometimes I just have to do it because

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,420
otherwise there's no more time left to

00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,890
do my work for my company and help my

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,980
clients and that's not gonna work in the

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,750
end what I do for the community is I

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,940
moderate the wordpress support forum for

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,040
the Netherlands see and help out of

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,919
course I see if bad things happen there

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,799
and moderate that my translation editors

00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,819
for WordPress in elements and what that

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,549
means is that everybody can work on

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,190
translations for WordPress and there

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,889
have to be some people or a team who

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,629
approve the translations to just be sure

00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,419
everything is correct everything uses

00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:49,480
the same kind of language and I'm in

00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:52,060
that team I was a co-organizer forward

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,449
cam Europe in 2013 it was enlightened

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,000
who was there that's great to see a few

00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:00,970
people here and I helped out forward

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,030
come to Netherlands 2014-2015 and also

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,910
in 2016 which was the last one as we

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,949
know there might it might happen again

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,629
if you want to join and help organise

00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:14,440
something like that well please contact

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:16,239
me or check us out on slack and see if

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,620
you want to help up with that and I'm

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,099
lead organizer forward can brought it

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,360
down last year and at the closing of

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:23,680
word camper water down last year I

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,810
announced that I was going to take a

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,720
step back and do a little less

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,580
in workers community but again I failed

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,460
and I'm gonna be lead for next year in

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,320
2019 so keep an eye out if you want to

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,660
go through water dam somewhere in march

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,370
april may be beginning of May we still

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,669
have to set a date keep an eye out for

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,710
that before I'm going to tell something

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:48,880
about my walk to Berlin I'm gonna try

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,230
and tell you how I got to the idea if I

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,080
know it because I don't really know

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,180
where it came from but I think it has

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,230
something to do with contributing to to

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,510
WordPress WordPress as a project is a is

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,070
big it's not only the software it's it's

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,550
the whole community around it it's the

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,400
translating it's the documentation it's

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,010
the support it's the design everything

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,940
and everything is done by people like

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,460
you and me most of it happens in spare

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,130
time or it's voluntary some of it is

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,470
sponsored by companies who hire people

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,740
to work full time on the WordPress

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,900
project which is great because without

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,640
that sponsoring and without the time

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,660
that people put into WordPress it could

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,930
have not been what it is right now

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:41,950
so users like you people who build

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,570
WordPress it's everybody so why why

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,970
would you contribute why is there

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,830
anybody here in the room who has not

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,520
contributed to WordPress right now and

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:55,900
don't feel sad or I see a few hands

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,660
there excellent excellent but there's

00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,060
room for improvement there because

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,580
contributing to WordPress is not only to

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,870
make WordPress better of course in the

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,470
end that's what we all want but it's

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,789
also to improve yourself and not only to

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,090
improve yourself in the skills you have

00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:15,510
but also broaden your skills if you're

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,039
if you're a developer a PHP developer

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,870
now might be a good time to start

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:21,850
looking at some JavaScript or react

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,180
stuff or help out in the Gutenberg

00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:28,150
Project or test it and report bugs and

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,360
all those kind of small things is part

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,400
of contributing to WordPress you can

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,950
share your knowledge like a lot of

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,330
people who are who are here on stage or

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,610
doing

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,750
shops in the other tracks share your

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,300
knowledge about what you have learned

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,639
about WordPress and inspire other people

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:50,550
not to start doing that themselves it's

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:53,099
a if they want an of course and the last

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,349
bullet point here what's what makes it

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:58,669
most important for me as a person is

00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:01,319
have fun and make friends new friends

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:04,020
meet up with people you've met on other

00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:08,099
word camps and share your experiences

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,870
and see what what can happen there I'm

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,370
not going to talk about how you can

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,930
contribute to WordPress and what kind of

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,319
areas you can contribute there's a lot

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,810
of information on make the WordPress org

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,940
there's a lot of teams eighteen teams if

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,270
I remember correctly so there's 18

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,370
different parts of the WordPress project

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,870

part org and read along if you're

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:37,650
interested in contributing to WordPress

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,969
anyone not familiar with slack everybody

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,129
knows slack well that's great

you might want to be a contributor to

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:57,779
that too so what about that walk to

00:07:51,960 --> 00:08:03,210
Berlin this was a the original tweet I

00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:06,150
tweeted out on June 4th of this year it

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,449
was about two weeks before wordcamp

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,400
europe in belgrade and i don't know

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,620
where it came from I had the idea of

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,479
walking maybe I was what I was looking

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,080
at the TV at somebody walking I don't

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,300
know I just had a brain wave which told

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,159
me maybe I should walk to work in here

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,770
up next time didn't know that it was

00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:28,680
going to be in Berlin yet and first we

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:33,120
had to go to Belgrade forward computer

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,459
of 2018 about a week after this tweet

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,570
I got an injury on my knee from out of

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:41,300
nowhere as if it was a sign from

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,760
somewhere whatever you believe in

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,220
telling me you're not gonna walk too

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,139
that's crazy don't do this stuff so I

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,570
was in bed for like the weekend and we

00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:52,310
can have trying well I couldn't walk

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,529
with my leg

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,449
I had medicine for it and I got cured

00:08:54,529 --> 00:09:01,490
and I can stand and I can walk again so

00:08:56,449 --> 00:09:03,260
that healed perfectly and then a quirk

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,149
in Belgrade was announced which I

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,800
couldn't attend I had to cancel the

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:08,480
travel plans I was gonna go there with

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,130
my wife and she was going to do some

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,709
sightseeing I was gonna do well we're

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,850
press things couldn't go there had to

00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:19,699
cancel everything which was pretty sad

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:22,610
at the end I got a strong feeling that

00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:24,199
this whole walking to the next word camp

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,449
I didn't know it was gonna be in Berlin

00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:29,240
that was gonna be something I had to

00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:31,399
pursue and not just for myself but maybe

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,070
I could do something more for the

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,540
WordPress community so I was going to

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,230
think why why would I want to go to

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,810
Berlin and because of the attention it

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,980
might give me which I'm already very

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,480
happy with with the attention I'm

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,630
getting also with all you guys here in

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,100
the room and I'm gonna raise awareness

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,029
for a good cause because that's a

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,709
perfect idea to raise awareness and tell

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,060
people about my walk and raise awareness

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:59,420
for a good cause and I'm gonna raise

00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:03,620
funds for that and the good cause is

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:07,069
donate WC and donate WC is a Foundation

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:10,699
which has four crew members right now

00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:13,910
five five crew members right now and the

00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:17,510
donate WC foundation helps people go to

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,519
work camps and support them financially

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,750
so if people want to go to a work camp

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,180
and being at Sandy be an organizer be a

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,519
speaker and I don't have any financial

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,529
means to do that the donate WC

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,110
Foundation can help people with that and

00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,300
of course they need you they need money

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,740
to help those people and I'm going to

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,930
raise money for that

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:45,160
good cause also why I'm doing it is

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:48,170
rearrange my comfort zone because

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:53,060
looking at this picture your comfort

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:55,690
zone is a defined space and a lot of

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:59,440
cool stuff happens outside of the

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,510
comfort zone one of the things also was

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,270
speaking for me I like to share my

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:08,050
knowledge in a small group of people on

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:11,020
a table in a small space and being on

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,300
stage I might look natural and relaxed

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,060
here but actually this card is going

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,640
pretty fast inside and every time I go

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,800
on stage I have I'm nervous I have the

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,590
feeling if everything is going to go all

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,870
right but wait let's do it let's just do

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,390
it take small steps and you get there

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,790
and of course I'm gonna be new people

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,410
I need places to sleep on my walk to

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,910
Berlin because it's gonna take me 30

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:42,580
days in a few stages and I need places

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:45,130
to sleep this is my route to Berlin you

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,560
can see here it's might not be readable

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:50,230
for everybody there's Rotterdam and a

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,670
small place called bare : Robo rice is

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,160
up there that's where I live and I'm

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,380
gonna leave there on May 19th and I'm

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,320

back well to Germany a piece of the Arts

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,810
how they call it and in the end I'm

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,150
going to Berlin

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,760
this map is on my website also and you

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,640
can see little beds on the route those

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,280
are the places where I'm already staying

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,110

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,400
they told me okay you can sleep at my

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,380
place

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,680
I was actually featured on a radio show

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:29,830
last Saturday on three of em where

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,690
people picked up my tweet and they sent

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,390
me a message and asked if I want to be

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,240
in their broadcast to help find the last

within an hour people have sent their

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,820

about this crazy adventure I'm gonna do

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,850
now there is there was a question that

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,670
the question was that there was a link

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,410
between Marcel boots man walking while

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,800
there wasn't but now there is I think I

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,050
like it

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,660
what walking has been something I've

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:53,089
been doing I have a dog at home so I

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,060
tend to walk well what I have two hours

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:58,700
a day with him and I like being outside

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,350
it cleared your mind and if I'm

00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,980
developing stuff and I'm stuck in

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,899
something I just well close my laptop

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,370
and I go outside with the dog and most

00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:09,529
of the times within four or five minutes

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,120
outside I have a bright idea and how I

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:14,570
should solve those kind of things so

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,610
walking is something therapeutic and I

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:20,220
hope those 30 days

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,050
but show me who I am what I'm gonna do

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,029
the next years and maybe it's gonna be a

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,829
big change I don't know but let's first

00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,860
try this challenge thank you requesting

00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:30,449

[Music]

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,420

00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:58,769
English the question of Antonis is

00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:01,439
asking is what am I gonna do to keep or

00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:04,259
to be mentally challenged during walking

00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:07,680
because it might be very I don't know

00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,300
for failing what's the boring I don't

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,920
like the I don't like I never I'm never

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,360
bored so I don't know the word in

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:17,910
English sorry I've been training for

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,740
about four or five times five times now

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,079
and been walking about thirty kilometers

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,560
that takes me about five and a half six

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,589
hours and I'm not bored a moment during

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,329
walking I see new things I well you

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:31,920
discover all kinds of new things that

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:33,540
you haven't seen even around your house

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,579
and then you're in your own town because

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,319
you always well you step on a bike or

00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,120
you go in the car and you drive off and

00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,250
you never see those things so I don't

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,139
think I'm gonna get bored and I will

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,730
meet people along the way I will meet

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,560
people in the in the afternoon or in the

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,600
evening when I arrive at the places

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,259
where I sleep so I don't see that as a

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:56,970
problem okay

00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:59,519
any other questions great well great

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:05,149

time minutes time exam give no wrong

00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:11,959
