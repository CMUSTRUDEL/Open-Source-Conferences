Title: Birgit Olzem: How your mental health (issues) affects your creativity
Publication date: 2020-04-05
Playlist: WordCamp Utrecht 2018
Description: 
	At the end of 2000, I first became acquainted with the internet and I had no idea back then that a mother of 5 and grandmother of 1 could have built a successful life that literally saved my own.
For the last fifteen years, I’m proud to say that WordPress, and it’s thriving community, has been a large part of my life. I’ve enjoyed making friends, attending WordCamps, and being part of Make WordPress.
The Internet has been a place where we share our joy. But what happens when life is interrupted? There are many things that will interrupt your life. Death. Divorce. Illness.
I’ve experienced all three. In this talk, I’ll share some of vital the lessons I’ve learned from being a part of such helpful and friendly community. Please join me during this session to not only hear my story, that many of us have experienced, but also for practical advice.

state of WordPress maybe I can tell you

00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,069

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:05,599
frustration try to be creative with the

00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:11,660
kind of adventure and yeah

00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:17,120
as Karen introduced me I am a mom of

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:19,459
five children this not enough I tried to

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,060
contribute to WordPress over several

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:24,670
years

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:29,090
I call myself or I get known as

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:32,209
WordPress and work a veteran so I'm not

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:37,640
the grumpy old woman like Brian told

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:40,310
herself but yeah I'm the chubby girl of

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,239
the WordPress community and today I

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:47,540
would like to share a little bit about

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:54,190
my own experience with mental health and

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:59,610
what effects has mental health I was

00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:02,460
trained as a life coach because

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:07,170
own experience and I have a big interest

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:13,290
not also in psychology and my first

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:17,490
question to you is Karen I have it I

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:20,820
mean I would like to ask you what if

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:25,170
someone knows what this kind of freaky

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:30,300
stuff is does someone knows it except

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:35,310
Karen you know it no I hate the fancy

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:40,200
stuff as helping people was just able to

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:44,130
use to put on socks on your feet you

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:48,870
roll up the sock on top and switch your

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:54,209
food into it to get your socks on your

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,880
feet because people like me we can reach

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:01,709
our feets because of some physical

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:07,470
disabilities but what does it happen to

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:14,459
be with creativity WordPress I can't

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:17,030
even pick a Tyler to that I mean why we

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,910
are here is we are talking about

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,970
creativity but what is creativity for

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,790
you

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:31,680
creativity is an expression of yourself

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:35,640
and it is really important that you be

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:40,080
aware of yourself and know and treat

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:44,220
yourself as an individual you are into

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:51,390
will and you are maybe struggling with

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:54,180
your your expression as yourself to tell

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:57,890
a little bit about you me about this

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:03,200
topic I was growing on the countryside

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:07,250
on a farm and I wasn't really accepted

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:10,970
my school with my classmates because I

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:15,650
was different I am always a person was

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:17,890
different I don't fit in any structure

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:22,220
or something like that because yeah

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:25,640
that's um really hard when you are the

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:29,410
age of nine and people are ignoring you

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:34,910
because you are different and you have

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:37,180
great ideas and yeah that was the first

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:41,240
time when I struggled with kind of

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:45,890
mental issues because I was really early

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,470
my young depressed about okay Who am I

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:54,080
where am i why they are treating me like

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:59,330
I am ayah they are begging me and loving

00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,910
it's a better word I guess so yeah there

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,970
are different ways to my youth and

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,470
trying to find myself but it didn't work

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:13,580
really well and then I got married and

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,350
then then I got pregnant or otherwise I

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,060
got pregnant and then I'm married

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:24,320
because I was hard it had to be married

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:27,290
my husband was all mostly on the road as

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,250
a truck driver so I was mostly alone

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:34,370
with my kids when you may ask you okay

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,400
he is never at home or at least some

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:41,930
days in a week why the heck that they

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:46,340
got five children together so my husband

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:50,780
told her mostly I was at home at the D

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:54,580
Day okay yeah we managed to get five

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:58,630
kids but in some case I I learned about

00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:02,270
I want to express myself more and and

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:05,300
bring my creativity into the world

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:09,879
but as a stay-at-home mom or I worked at

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:13,689
least a lot what my mom's restaurant

00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:17,050
I have my hobby building websites I

00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:21,309
don't know fine of you know the software

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:25,419
that objects fusion are there some

00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:30,039
people in this room okay I'm really an

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:34,059
old person yeah there I had in mind my

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:38,740
first experience building websites okay

00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:42,369
like um scratching them and so I learned

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,649
a little bit about how it works and it

00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:47,169
work and this is what I did in the

00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:51,069
evenings when my kids are and what we're

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:58,089
in bet and someday I found about

00:07:51,069 --> 00:08:01,990
WordPress I did a little bit with some

00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:03,550
kind of scripts like be to Cafe lark and

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,639
Dionysus are all the WordPress

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,199
interesting but in the first version it

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,439
wasn't really is so interesting to

00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,719
building website but it was blogging

00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,369
blogging I don't want to block I want to

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:19,689
build websites and I want to lose

00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:27,579
website with my clients on and 2507 part

00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:30,519
and yeah and I got some jobs at attempt

00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:33,789
to work cams and I got breakfast related

00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:36,310
jobs and I got embroidered into the

00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,560
virtuous community I worked for an

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,959
agency in Germany who maintained the

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,630
translations for the German WordPress

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,850
community and my first task as an

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:50,079
employee was to maintain this

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,819
translation and formal version and an

00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:55,689
informal version maybe you are talking

00:08:51,819 --> 00:09:00,100
about too kind twice translating

00:08:55,689 --> 00:09:05,470
WordPress and so I managed to translate

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:08,439
Bert Reza I guess what was 3.5 was about

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:12,910
four thousand four thousand strings to

00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:16,600
translate I have to do by myself was

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:20,490
funny took a while but yeah I manage it

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,870
yeah and so I was always asking my

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:27,060
so how where I am I Who am I and this

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:30,630
verb in the community because I'm not a

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:34,440
developer I'm not so deep in code like

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:39,680
Chris are you an audience whether I'm a

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:45,630
designer so I didn't fit any place into

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:50,450
company's classic jobs so that was I

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:54,209
need to find myself what are my talents

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:57,600
Who am I and which kind cannot fit into

00:09:54,209 --> 00:10:01,410
and through my education of a life coach

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,430
alone about the big five the big five is

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:07,410
called the personality traits you can

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:13,649
call it also the ocean that's where I

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:18,000
choose the theme of my science the first

00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:22,200
is in the oceans the openness the

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,190
openness is your experience and to that

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:29,310
describes your deepness and club

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:33,450
flexibility of your mental health of

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:37,670
your your your mind how you are thinking

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:45,899
and how open you are to new kind of

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:49,170
explorations and adventures and then the

00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,660
conscience soon this is a bird I college

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:54,510
was really good it is a trait that can

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:59,149
you describe as a tendency to control

00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:03,240
your impulses and also to act social and

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:05,730
social accepted because as you know an

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,820
overt camp you as an attending a sign

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,820
that you are aware about the code of

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:16,410
conduct and are you are nice to your

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:21,089
people around you and this is this trait

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:24,600
which beings forward for that and also

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:28,630
your behaviors and how to facilitate

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:33,220
your own good direction every

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:38,400
think what is accepted and they in the

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:43,270
world then is there the part of

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:47,560
extraversion as how are you going

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:52,230
outside or inside you know from you is

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:55,740
more introvert yeah

00:11:52,230 --> 00:12:00,130
you have also an extra version so

00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:04,300
extraversion but you have other ways to

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:07,450
to share it so and everyone is going how

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,970
to deal with your own energy level so of

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,160
it it's important that you know yourself

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,040
where are you energy levels and what

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,740
sucks energy and reduce your energy so

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:23,200
if you find this for you then you have

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:30,310
your extra version and the next part is

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:35,530
agreeableness how you are going to agree

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:38,710
with concerns around you and how you are

00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:48,040
in take yourself into the community you

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:56,320
are and also the norm take now your take

00:12:48,040 --> 00:13:00,730
I don't know solve the film with forget

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,700
it there is so many great songs so how

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,400
people are neurotic but it's also being

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,100
confident with yourself and loving

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,950
yourself and your own body especially

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,910
for me I'm a person with nothing the

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:18,400
ideal model

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:21,040
measurin but I have to feel confident

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:27,190
with me and accept myself in that way I

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:32,200
am here and that's why it's important to

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:35,650
learn your five big five it helps you to

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,700
learn about yourself about your unique

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:43,290
personality everyone in this room

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:45,960
the unique personality and that is the

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,690
first step to leverage also your

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,200
strengths and find about your weakness

00:13:48,690 --> 00:14:01,590
and take a balance into your daily

00:13:52,200 --> 00:14:03,660
business and daily work yeah but even if

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,870
you found out about your own bigger

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:10,380
behind five I found about myself and I

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:13,940
found out that I don't fit any big

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:17,710
companies setting daily traffic

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,890
Communicator going daily on office and

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,760
[Music]

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,660
fixed structures

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:27,990
I need my my creative space I have to I

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:32,070
need to go to a cafe and riding there

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:38,070
and sitting on my balcony and so that's

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:40,830
a place while sometimes maybe lost my

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:44,850
jobs because I didn't fit really well

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:50,060
and some concepts of companies so I

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:52,830
decided to go self employed full-time

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,950
but if you have five kids and three

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:58,050
hours are living with me at home

00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:03,570
you have enough responsibility to fill

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:12,330
your fridge it's not always easy but

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:15,990
yeah I learned about life sucks

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:18,420
sometimes especially when you are a

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:23,640
creative person you have done fits and

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:26,970
the normal stuff the chance is to get

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,970
depressed or get some mental disorders

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:35,370
it was really good I can recommend it

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:40,410
not but at one point in my life I

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:42,690
decided to quit my marriage and leave my

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,490
husband with my kids because the

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,880
situation wasn't really good because you

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:50,740
are the whole week away you in his truck

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,550
and I was going

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,520
moving forward learning new skills and

00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:02,140
but the communication wasn't really good

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:05,589
and so I decided to get into a new wind

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:10,860
shirt so and I had to fight about my

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:13,570
kids right and my husband wasn't really

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:17,470
amused about the fact that I wanted to

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:20,080
leave him so the years after the

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,640
decision was deliberate was really worse

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:28,240
for me I had to fight for my kids I had

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:32,110
a budget about five six hundred euros

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:36,940
per month to pay my bills to fill the

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:40,600
fridge I had no car and then I got ill

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:45,760
also what it's not really easy to work

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:49,930
and get some income yeah but as you see

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:56,100
good news I managed to come of the

00:16:49,930 --> 00:17:01,360
situation so it worked sometimes yeah

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:08,429
but it is really important to show also

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,429
word ability and ask for help because

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:17,559
when you are able to ask for help

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:20,650
it is not unsign off of socking and not

00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:24,040
dealing with something it is a show of

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:26,890
your strength because when you are aware

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,770
you need help you can't figure out it by

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,870
yourself it's the best part what you can

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,870
do ask for help

00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:43,620
because your individual team makes a

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:50,909
difference I think every one of you know

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:58,940
some artists like van Gogh avid Einstein

00:17:50,909 --> 00:18:04,169
has a great mind and also Robin Williams

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:07,950
actor what every one of them had also

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:09,269
mental disorders of depression

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:15,110
schitzophrenic

00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:20,820
cetera yeah

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:23,519
but they did great work and the

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:27,480
researchers showed that there is a link

00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:32,549
or maybe a link between creativity and

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:38,029
creative process and mental disorders so

00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:42,809
it may be can be that the link is there

00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:45,870
it can help creativity can help or make

00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:49,139
burnable to mental disorders like I

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:52,620
described by myself when you don't fit

00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:56,970
in any complex systems and feel also

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:59,899
pressure and can't express yourself and

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:05,010
your creativity it can make you really

00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:08,279
frustrated and depressed but also mental

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:12,120
disorders may help one person to be

00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:16,620
creative let's take the example was

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,549
Winston forgot he painted his image with

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,920
the sunflowers

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:26,010
I guess you can

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:29,380
after a big face of mental disorders I

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:35,830
mean when he cut off his ear because of

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:39,030
society process around but he created a

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:42,880
great artwork which lasts over several

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:46,060
decades and you are sitting here and you

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,240
know the person but this expression was

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,030
about mental disorders so it's not my

00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:56,020
recommendation to cut off your ear to

00:19:52,030 --> 00:20:00,820
get known as a creative person but maybe

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:04,030
it is helping that you could find your

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:07,030
own way to be creative you can be

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:10,240
creative when you are writing code you

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,250
can be creating writing articles you can

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,200
be creative

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:17,290
designing it's a visual part of a

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,850
creativity but also you can be creative

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:24,190
in your workflow on daily basis when you

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:26,650
you are fitting figuring out that your

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:30,460
workflow is not fitting to your

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:32,770
personality then change it so when you

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,380
don't have the chance to change your

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:42,940
environment then maybe you can change

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:46,240
your own view on this workflow yeah

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:50,380
there are some links and there are many

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:56,820
research around that but for me it is

00:20:50,380 --> 00:21:03,720
important to to express that there's a

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:08,830
big chance to explore the personality of

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:11,860
yourself of myself to bring it on the on

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:14,590
the street like I call it like to say to

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,190
bring the tires on the on the street and

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:21,929
move

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:25,500
what I learned about my situation was

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:31,049
yeah life sucks but if you take some

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:33,840
concepts on everyday I had some mental

00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:38,970
dish issues not only mental issues but

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:43,460
I've physical issues because I have both

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,460
hips are not in the best shape I had

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,929
they're not sitting right in the

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,840
position and so this I have hypnosis

00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:55,169
since the age of 15

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:59,309
so that's makes difficult for me to walk

00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:02,279
long distances or stand a long time this

00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:05,039
is what something that makes frustrating

00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,700
because con work you you won't explore

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,770
the world

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:14,940
you want to make visiting and going

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:17,669
through each I to see stuff I can't do

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,970
so it's sometimes frustrating but I

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:25,320
accepted my situation but some years ago

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:29,179
it's not so long I guess two years I am

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:33,960
situation that I got an infection which

00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:37,799
sucks all energy of me and I couldn't go

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:42,450
out of that not of mental issues but I

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:44,970
was totally fatigued I had no energy to

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:50,070
to move from the bat and go to the

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:55,230
bathroom or cooking or gathering outside

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:58,830
on the door no way I mean there had some

00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:04,320
situation where I decided he thought

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:09,779
about okay Mike's life sentence in the

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:13,730
situation but as I said asking for help

00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:17,980
I found help with a good natural

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:21,790
practitioner who figured out where the

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:25,900
actually come from and we found our ways

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:28,510
how to get out of it but there was also

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:32,679
my financial situation through getting

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:35,860
job losing job getting job losing job so

00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:41,790
it was really difficult to stay on track

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:45,250
with different tasks I have to do so I

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:47,559
went forward to get more healthy I went

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:51,250
forward to get jobs but I didn't had

00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:59,190
enough budget to was at bergkamp's

00:23:51,250 --> 00:24:04,290
something I love doing since 2010 I yeah

00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:07,419
and worst red camp Europe and Paris and

00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:12,190
I couldn't go there because my budget

00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:14,590
said no no way you can't go because it's

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,200
really expensive it's not so far away

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:21,309
from home town but it's really expensive

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,970
to stay etc and then I asked on Twitter

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:28,450
or just shared my situation and said

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:30,910
okay if there is a wonder happening that

00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:34,450
I can go to Paris and someone finds a

00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:37,870
room or something for me I would like to

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:40,690
go and then it's the big miracle

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:42,669
happened and a good friend of mine of

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:46,510
the German workers community had a spare

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:50,770
room he had a double overbooked room in

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:55,240
the hotel and he offered me his room for

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:58,390
free and he offered me also to bring me

00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,440
by car to Paris we met each other on a

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:04,120
milonga

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:07,770
street and then we went to Paris and at

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:11,169
this time I were suffering from the

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:14,970
infection and I went through the bird

00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:18,880
cam venue was two sticks and tried to

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:23,929
get him forward and people who knows me

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:28,110
a long time saw me trying to work

00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:31,320
but this event our that in the

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:34,640
generosity I learned about that helped

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,490
me a lot together

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:46,380
motivated to move forward and get

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:48,920
motivated to yeah enjoy my life again

00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,770
because I was on the point when I

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:56,429
thought about to quit my life and

00:25:51,770 --> 00:26:05,460
through this great great offer

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:08,370
I saw it okay I can make it and so it

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,730
happened that I've learned more and I

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:14,809
was more confident and say okay even if

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm not fitting in a role model or some

00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:21,000
great models on the stage but I'm a

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:28,290
person I have so many quality to bring

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:31,980
with me and know what I can do I so that

00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:39,809
I'm thinking to share my experience with

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:42,230
you I have some takeaways it's every

00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:46,740
time you ask for help

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:51,270
you will get help but not even in this

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:57,200
way you might be want to help sometimes

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:59,730
the help comes from unknown ways and

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,230
don't let yourself be banned

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:06,210
don't let it that you get bonded or in

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:11,460
your in some structure you don't fit

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:16,380
into and especially take small steps but

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:18,960
keep working especially a Marcel is

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:24,870
going to work in Europe and early next

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:29,400
year and he's taking small steps from

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:32,330
his hometown through Germany up to

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:36,320
Bellini and I hope that you find some

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,320
accommodation in Germany as well

keep asking keep going and also if you

00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:03,289
are happening with some issues are live

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:09,589
events like my mom died my best friend

00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:12,559
died I got ill um I got divorced and my

00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:14,509
kids now I have five children you know

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,649
you can imagine every child has some

00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:22,849
health issues sometimes so after five

00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:27,080
kids five times issues and school issues

00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:30,889
something but yeah resilience can be

00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:35,869
learned I got asked and before my talk

00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:41,440
how am I able to do this I'm chef

00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:47,570
employed five kids and yeah not answered

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:54,489
just doing and not overthink keep it

00:28:47,570 --> 00:29:01,009
simple as possible but what happens is I

00:28:54,489 --> 00:29:05,679
ask this this is also part of learning

00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:09,679
and resilience I was thinking about

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:13,669
purchased this kind of stuff some years

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:17,629
ago but I thought it's something for old

00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:22,279
people and it's also a kind of

00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:27,320
resignation not being able to put on my

00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:35,259
socks by myself without any help but

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:42,169
then I decided to purchase this and I

00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:45,079
put on my socks and my shoes and about

00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:46,930
four minutes which took me mostly about

00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:49,770
thirty minutes to

00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:53,440
myself to get my socks on my feet and

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,580
people who don't have these issues can't

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,060
understand it

00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:03,580
but for me it was a freedom to put out

00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:07,630
my socks again and work again and put on

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:10,600
my shoes and try to get more fit and

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:13,770
more healthy on every day this is my

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:17,290
small steps I have to practice currently

00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:20,280
my family is in a great shape now I'm

00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:24,720
loving part in over four years now and

00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:26,260
my kids are growing and I love to see my

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,810
grandchild

00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:33,510
growing he's now six months all that

00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:37,960
yeah my wish too to play with him and

00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:41,200
sit on the floor and play with him it's

00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,710
not that easy but I know I have to find

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:48,400
creative ways how to enjoy the time with

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:51,880
my grandchild with my body disabled teas

00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:55,060
but also learning how to deal with the

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,170
mental issues disabled tea brings with

00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:02,230
it and that's where the creative

00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:05,430
creativity comes again into topic if you

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:09,570
have any kind of disorders or mental

00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:13,800
issues or stress or something like that

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:18,250
use your creativity to find ways out and

00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:21,820
use the creativity also to explore your

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:25,120
goals what are you wanting from yourself

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,840
in your life what is the next goal for

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:32,290
you what is the next step for you and

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:36,310
which is you can move forward and create

00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:39,150
a great expression and you are seen in

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,150
your life

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:54,779
I would like to ask you a little bit

00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:58,679
about your experience does someone of

00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:08,100
you have some experience was creativity

00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:11,820
and mental health issues okay you've

00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:16,580
started when you have your started with

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,580
mental issues and to get creative or

00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:27,899
okay yeah that's a good example

00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:29,669
you told you started your creativity by

00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:33,230
your ass when you're asking yourself

00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:38,250
through the burnout when I yeah yes

00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:41,490
Bernard is often a starting point of the

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:43,230
reinvention of your life but is it

00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:47,460
really necessary that we have to burn

00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:49,789
out before we change our life I don't

00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,860
think so

00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:55,559
personally I was torn off but because I

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,909
had so many life events in a short time

00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:04,559
I had no other chance to burn out but

00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:08,570
yeah maybe you find ways during your day

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,509
especially when you start moving outside

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:17,039
get a good routine on the up databases

00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:20,399
find the way you find get joy in your

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:26,690
life happiness in your life even in

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:31,950
small small steps and yeah that's what

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:37,139
helped me a lot and it's applauding also

00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:39,659
the community and making friends even if

00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:41,770
you're a remote worker try to find

00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,350
places where you can

00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,900
the lives of people because the most

00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:50,050
people are of this in the room are

00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:53,470
sitting in the office or in home office

00:33:50,050 --> 00:34:01,050
or in a co-working space and it can make

00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:05,020
feel alone and to avoid burning out true

00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:07,600
feeling of the loneliness you can find

00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:12,820
creative ways where you can socialize

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:15,720
with your own big-five exploration and

00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,720
being yourself

00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,790
and that's why I thought about

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,760
creativity has long been associated with

00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:36,220
mental disorders there are so many

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:40,750
research but my my experience is to find

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:45,460
the own ways where you can explore and I

00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:47,470
give your creativity outside and find

00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:53,950
ways where you can find your resilience

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:59,340
and even if the life was talking there

00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:59,340
every time a way out of the situation

00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,130
and that's what I want to say

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:17,430
thank you thank you very much for

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:21,530
sharing this very personal story are

00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,530
there any questions from the audience I

00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,890
don't see I mean can I ask you I know

00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,560
you would really God for that about

00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,810
women and repress and finding their

00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,680
state they're just the right place for

00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:39,380
them how did he get over the fear of

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,310
speaking in public

00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:46,079
that's a good question especially when

00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:53,190
you're not really confident with the

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:59,040
body Arsenal my motivation is to inspire

00:35:53,190 --> 00:36:01,230
people and so that's why I learn to stay

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,800
more confident and this is something you

00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:09,240
can learn it starts on a small meetup

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,280
group maybe and then you can start to go

00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,520
on a stage or something like that

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,460
and you more your practice then you're

00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:20,849
more confident if you're confident when

00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:23,310
you have some disabilities like standing

00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:25,349
a long time it can damage a little bit

00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,450
your confidence and bring you out of

00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:31,950
your trend what do we ever want to say

00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:33,470
but yeah I learned to find this fear of

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,540
public speaking

00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:39,780
do you ever feel like you're an impostor

00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:41,359
Horace does that fade in the back into

00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:47,609
the background

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:51,119
no I think I have also started to

00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:54,690
imposter syndrome sometimes but it gets

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,270
better it's definitely on daily basis

00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:00,210
that's good to hear yeah well thank you

00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:02,310
very much and good luck with everything

00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,369
