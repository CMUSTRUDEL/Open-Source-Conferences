Description: 
	At the end of 2000, I first became acquainted with the internet and I had no idea back then that a mother of 5 and grandmother of 1 could have built a successful life that literally saved my own.
For the last fifteen years, I’m proud to say that WordPress, and it’s thriving community, has been a large part of my life. I’ve enjoyed making friends, attending WordCamps, and being part of Make WordPress.
The Internet has been a place where we share our joy. But what happens when life is interrupted? There are many things that will interrupt your life. Death. Divorce. Illness.
I’ve experienced all three. In this talk, I’ll share some of vital the lessons I’ve learned from being a part of such helpful and friendly community. Please join me during this session to not only hear my story, that many of us have experienced, but also for practical advice.
