yes you can tell me good I'm gonna start

00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:12,080
my talk with the story the mask a few

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,689
years ago I was living in the

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,750
Philippines and I was very excited about

00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:20,030
the trip I had problems like my o mas so

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,670
I thought why not buy a new one so I did

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,570
like sex I brought my new my fancy new

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,850
case brought it with me Philippines

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:31,400
something Viet happened that because

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,400
instead of using my new mask I stuck to

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,659
my old one which was flooding does

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,880
anyone here

00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:42,860
scuba dive no I guess what's one of the

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,290
most common problems when you're scuba

00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,970
dive

00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:50,000
exactly your mud flaps

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,759
and when that happens you tend to and by

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,329
you I mean I tend to panic underwater

00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,000
and it's easy for accidents to happen so

00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:00,500
I think now you're understand family

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,420
really has taken to switch to my new

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,770
mask right stick with the old one

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,989
I know how many PLAs

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:11,900
the velocity okay so I met a more

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:14,959
experienced eye well when I was there he

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,599
heard about the situation and he said to

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,590
me something really profound

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,709
he said Karen your new mask is useless

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:29,900
sitting it in your case in your hotel

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:30,790
room use it so on the next time I use my

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,400
new mask

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,090
can you guess what happened nothing

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,140
happened

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,569
it worked well quite did I tell you this

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,420
story and what the hell has it got to do

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:47,360
with emails here is something really

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:51,380
interesting I noticed I'm personally

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,989
subscribe to 700 plus email lists I also

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,690
create email sequences and sales funnels

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:59,690
for different businesses and I noticed

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,180
something just like me leaving my new

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,120
mask in his case in my hotel room and

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,000
touched many business owners collects

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,510
emails and I do nothing with it they

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,299
leave their email lists untouched yeah I

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,010
think some of you are yeah that's me

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:21,190
no I won't say who you are but yep

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:23,480
that's me okay so why are you here today

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,060
we are here today because you're a

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,230
business owner or you're a marketer and

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:33,230
you know that having an email list is a

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,260
major asset to your business so you

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,720
built one now you have an email list but

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,310
you are doing nothing with it you would

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,410
like to give trust of your subscribers

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,590
you would like to turn your leads into

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,930
customers you know you should email your

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,780
list but that's kind of like priority

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,730
number 100 in your top 100 list so

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,690
you're not really doing anything with

00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:58,579
that so today I'm gonna share with you a

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,099
framework for connecting with your

00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:05,989
subscribers when they first sign up for

00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:08,260
your list this Rimbaud follows a very

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,750
famous copywriting formula I think some

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,599
you must be familiar with it already

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,690
it's called a pas copywriting formula

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,079
where P stands from problem a sense my

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:23,020
education and S stands for solution

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,449
I must suggest sending all these emails

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,880
within the first week of someone signing

00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:31,289
up and that's because that's when your

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,729
interest level in you is the highest and

00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:35,919
email zero the welcome email should be

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:38,110
sent immediately once people give you

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,260
their email address and the next email

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,210
to be sent out a day or two later after

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,250
the previous one

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,990
once email tree the solution email is

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:52,539
sent you can then go back to your

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:55,930
regular newsletters now let's look at

00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:57,789
email zero the welcome email here's

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,260
where you'll thank the subscribers for

00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,139
giving you her email address

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,449
you're welcome hurts your lips and if

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,580
you promised a freebie for people giving

00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,949
you their email address here's where you

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,470
should include that freebie - I also

00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,930
find this email a great place to ask

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,330
questions of your subscribers questions

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,550
like what made you decide to sign up for

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,910
my list and what were you hoping to get

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,160
out of it - benefits to this first

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,220
benefit you get to understand your

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,570
subscribers better so it means you can

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,630
create better products for your

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,660
customers in future second benefit a bit

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:37,030
sneaky but it works you can your email

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,039
address whitelist in your inbox so you

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,900
can be sure that your email shows are in

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:48,070
their inbox the next time you'll send

00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:50,289
them an email email one problem what you

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,139
talk about here is the problem that your

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:55,479
subscriber has you try to tell a story

00:05:53,139 --> 00:06:00,099
around it I think most of us here I'm

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:02,169
not a natural one talents at writing so

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:05,380
one way to help you think about it is

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:08,289
think about one of your clients and tell

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,000
a story about that client people buy

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,949
your product or service because they

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,979
have a problem so think about what

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:18,610
problem you are solving for them let's

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,720
apply in real life assuming assuming we

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,480
are not by assuming

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,780
we are a pest accountants how will we

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,280
write this email

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,230
let's first let's think about why people

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,360
hire your tax accountants it's because

00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,760
they cannot figure out the Texas on your

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,560
own like me they don't know if they are

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,390
doing things correctly they don't know

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,600
if they're all paying or under paying

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:46,390
the balancing things very important ok

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,200
that is in my case how an example email

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,550
could look like my brother-in-law

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,340
started his own renovation and

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,130
construction business last year he is

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,440
very good at what he does but up until

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,720
now he's obviously an employee so he

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,470
never needed to handle his on Texas and

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,380
his own bookkeeping his company gente at

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,060
all and as an employee

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:13,510
following his income taxes was very

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:18,360
straightforward easy not that he's

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,360
become a business owner all this changed

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:25,060
then we move on to number email number

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,980
two education education is when you talk

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,720
about the stupid things that people do

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,720
to make their existing problem even

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,190
worse than before so I've been there I

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,840
know what it feels like you keep digging

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,830
yourself into a hole and you don't want

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,020
to get off in other words even though

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:44,680
it's painful you really want to twist

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,430
the knife into the young ones yeah yeah

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,490
you heard me right

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,050
I think that frees the knife into Devils

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,530
continuing with the previous story since

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:56,440
how I will continue my brother-in-law

00:07:53,530 --> 00:08:01,060
decided to do it all himself in order to

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,160
save money but he doesn't know if it is

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,590
making all the right declarations on his

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,080
company he doesn't know it is making all

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,970
the deductions that he could and he

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,880
doesn't know if his overpaying or under

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:16,060
paying the tax office to make matters

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,160
even worse he created an excel file but

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,830
he didn't want to open or update the

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,020
fall for his bookkeeping purposes okay

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,610
so that sounds like a lot prettier key

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:31,150
situation right then you move on to

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,710
email tree solution solution is where

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,640
you can talk about how someone

00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:39,250
else tackle the same problem and very

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,110
important this is where you transition

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,930
to a peach for your own service or

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,370
product I know most of us here don't

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,910
want to be pushing when the council

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,620
sells and I think people who are hearing

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,260
but come naturally they are not really

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,779
still see screaming internet marketers

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,089
type that's a breach that you can use

00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:02,170
the transition and that breach is by

00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:04,870
offering people quick mini by answering

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,730
some frequently asked questions or by

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,990
suggesting some popular tools or

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,899
resources here's how I write a manometry

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,209
meet Sandra my ex-colleague after being

00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:18,279
a corporate drone for ten years she

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:20,760
decided to strike it out on her own and

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:24,510
vehicle on freelancing business

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,430
however she hates us precious she hated

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,589
bookkeeping she hated numbers so right

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,080
from the beginning she decided to hire a

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:34,300
professional text accountant to handle

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,020
all her accounting and taxes and

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,820
bookkeeping now when I look at her she

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,520
hardly needs to lift a finger

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,480
she just follows offer visas dance offer

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,190
invoices to this guy putting and she

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,430
sleeps easy at night knowing that

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:54,490
everything is so correctly at the text

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:57,100
office if you're not ready to hire

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,890
someone now I suggest you start with an

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,230
online accounting software like wait X

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:05,350
this is one of the best resources I

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,529
found for small business owners but if

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,839
you want to be like Sandra call me for

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:13,330
new applications meeting where we can go

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,040
over your books together and check if

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,490
you've been following your taxes

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,950
correctly so your mass email yeah and

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,010
it's like a call to action for them to

00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:26,170
call you and that's a piece and it's

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:32,740
kind of soft and not too much in your

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:35,020
face okay yes the most painful part of

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,930
today's talk with look at that email

00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,730
suspect and I want to share with you

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,709
some lessons

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,589
learns the hard way from previous

00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:44,970
projects in the past years and I really

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,779
hope that you won't have to experience

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:51,570
this for yourself first lesson number

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:55,290
one look for an email service provider

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,880
with 24-hour customer service if any one

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:01,889
of you here are in con sensitive deals

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,670
ecommerce stores you want to look out

00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:07,829
for this and that's because most email

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,440
service providers operate out of the

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:13,459
American tamson but we are here in

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,449
Europe so that's pretty useless was

00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:21,209
another thing when you google online for

00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:23,100
comparison and reviews many of them

00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:25,740
don't take this into account

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,980
so do your own due diligence when you

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,610
select one just emailed answers to us if

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,930
they provide 24-hour customer service

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,930
Black Friday is coming up soon I

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:40,199
remember about two years ago I nearly

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:43,139
chew off my own fingers because that was

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,720
an urgent change we needed to make right

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,180
before Black Friday and I couldn't get

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,649
anyone because they are not open for

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:54,779
business lesson number two when you just

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,810
add your email list don't start with

00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:00,540
something overly complex like

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:03,240
Infusionsoft I've heard horror stories

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,779
of business owners needing to hire a

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,209
specialist just to make changes to their

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:13,889
emails and I don't think you want to be

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:15,600
caught in such a situation also when you

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,120
just start you don't really that many

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,949
bells and whistles personally I've seen

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,410
the backend of Infusionsoft I take a

00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:24,480
small like a CRM software then an email

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,060
platform so if you're not looking for a

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,170
CRM I think you don't need to start with

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,149
this lesson number three don't migrate

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,300
too often from one email service

00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:39,089
provider to another that's because each

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,949
time you migrate your day a week in

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,290
rates will drop no matter what the new

00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:44,820
platform

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,790
we fell into this trap there was a

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,700
website I work with where we had 18,000

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,709
plus subscribers there was a new

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,190
function that we wanted so we switch

00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:58,170
providers waiting a few days we went

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,089
back to the original one because our

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,190
deliverability rates dropped so much

00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:04,230
that we just thought the new function

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,360
could not make it worthwhile so be aware

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,950
of that and don't talk to of them

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,470
between different email service

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:15,300
providers to recap we look at the first

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,329
four emails to send subscribers when

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:23,930
they sign up using the PAS copywriting

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:28,230
framework what does key stand for yes

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:31,079
education solution great young men

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,760
listening not flipping thank you okay

00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,640
we've looked at how to send a personal

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,560
email out when to send them the PAS

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,350
copywriting framework I share a view

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,870
between peat falls to avoid when you

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,529
choose an email service provider what's

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:49,950
next I see some of you taking notes so

00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:52,680
you're gonna go home today and a week or

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,779
two later you open up your notes look at

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,029
them and this is the point where

00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,940
self-doubt starts to creep in I know

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:02,550
because I've been there when that

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,440
happens I want you to think about my

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,040
story at the beginning of today's

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,720
presentation yeah the mask story just

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,709
like how the more experienced diver

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,660
helped me to overcome my fear and

00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:18,209
encouraged me to take the new mask out

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,760
of his case and use it I like to

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:23,910
encourage you to blow the dust of your

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,399
email list and send an email to your

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,459
subscribers I'll leave you with these

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,699
pots the best mask is the one you use

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:35,970
the best plan is the one you follow and

00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:40,320
the best email marketing strategy is the

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,720
one that you're actually executed I wish

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,070
everyone here an email list that results

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:53,430
in lots and lots of

00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:56,930
SILS Thank You Zach the product
