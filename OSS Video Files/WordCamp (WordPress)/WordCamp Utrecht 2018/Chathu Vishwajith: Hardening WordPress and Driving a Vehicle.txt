Publication date: 2020-04-04
Playlist: WordCamp Utrecht 2018
Description: 
	I would like to talk about recent serious security incidents had with WordPress installations and Start with the general points that anybody who is going to use or currently using WordPress needs to put their attention compared with driving a vehicle. Then I will suggest few plugins and services that I use and will request the audience to engage and let their suggestions too.I have mastered Art of hardening WordPress installation more than 30+ in Sri Lanka and other clients abroad.

[Applause]

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,860
okay so yeah I found out all three in

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:21,520
one picture from the Google so this is

00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:24,890
Tesla one of my dreams one day yeah so

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,710
this is about not about them so you may

00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,880
wonder what is Tesla doing inside

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:35,420
security topic in WordPress so let me go

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,930
in wrong so my topic is actually hardly

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:42,200
WordPress and a drive make two different

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:47,570
topics I will be able to combine them

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:50,949
very kind going to N so Who am I I'm Cho

00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,930
it should it from Sri Lanka

00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:57,859
I'm also an odd seal an ambassador a

00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:00,079
company specializing I am identity a

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,030
service and giving you some password

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,369
builders login and to a spife

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,830
working and working very much and

00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:10,130
contributing to open source ecosystem

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:15,350
and I on my startup that's it about me

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:23,689
so some whatever's in my garage

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:26,329
yeah in rates of my garage so what are

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:29,049
the things we need to think consider

00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:36,409
when you drive when to drive a maker

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:40,610
input from you yeah you need cleaners

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:44,329
and it breaks Moscow public breaks yeah

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:48,829
so the first thing is actually the car

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:51,820
is in good condition it's enjoyable well

00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,250
we did get the parts when I going around

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,600
another thing is if you have good car

00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:01,070
you need to click your the maintenance

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,390
yeah you need to think about your car

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:08,390
what do you like a clean one it's a BMW

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:11,570
no no one I don't know what is it do you

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:14,540
like which one so I think you prefer

00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:17,890
they're gonna be no one sure but if

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,890
you're a geek you'd like that away

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,600
you try something and me include things

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,480
but for perspective WordPress and normal

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,230
general people I think the cleaner man

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
is a must-visit

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,340
so if it is mint and well if it will

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,230
keep it like that or if you are not

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,420
maintaining well you're going to be like

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,180
that if you put many plugins I know

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,720
anything's already stuff it were you

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,750
going like that so that's wrong

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,760
other thing is you have a good car but

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,090
do you have good road conditions where I

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,350
would make them yeah why you like bumpy

00:02:52,090 --> 00:03:00,220
rides over like a good time yeah when it

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:02,970
comes my car my country so the second

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:07,270
one is much better

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,040
so imagine so the other pensions also

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,130
matters you need to have good road

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,480
conditions other thing is you will know

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,020
you are good driver

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,170
the others are good buyers so you need

00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,880
to have good ecosystem also are they are

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,970
good drivers even though you would drive

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,850
well somebody will knock you off having

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,310
drunk or I mean to Calais or maybe in a

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:33,220
mobile phone Steve you get accidents

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,560
even though you are good private Oh

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,730
maybe like this yes common in Sri Lanka

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,680
and more confident in yourself so yeah

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,480
this is going to be like even though you

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,739
have good drivers even here are good

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,540
drivers we will be end up like this and

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,610
other thing is you stay private

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,709
are you curious so I thinking about you

00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:02,110
that it's safe and or you think you are

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:04,329
like this yeah that's not good that's

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,250
not going to be good right maybe you

00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:08,350
know other good by us feel we can

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,209
getting even though you're good drivers

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,010
and you have all the good riders in the

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,150
world

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:19,329
maybe you still have a bad knock you get

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,850
end up like this even do you have a good

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:26,120
car like BMW but you will like end up

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:28,760
like this even a branded pole

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,190
so you can think what the point is

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,720
actually you need to maintain everything

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:39,949
but still you will get into troubles

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,680
from the back so it's okay

00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,680
in our case it's all enough now he's

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,470
going back to the topic so what's going

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,600
on in Whiteface

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:54,919
so this what this is secure I mean

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,070
everything that the very basics in you

00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,070
already

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,169
that's good

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,280
you have a kind of a good faith and good

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,880
trustworthiness for the workplace that's

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,560
cool

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,510
so anyway but what is secure okay but

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,360
there can be some especially special

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,419
things happening otherwise I won't going

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:22,700
to talk about this anymore every signal

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:26,870
so let's go it not so the thread is

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,160
actually coming from 50% Parliament is

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,260
actually from the world best part in

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,870
itself and 30% actually from my risk for

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,560
itself

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,840
it went percent from tips that's the

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,120
thing so we are the developers kind of

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,639
things but we like to have box in the

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,740
corner you know we cannot have 100

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,950
particular or hundred pendants but

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,500
fabulous software it's a kind of a meat

00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,970
so that's going to be but we will do

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,470
continuous implements and all those

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,380
things so you don't need to worry about

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,560
so the reason is built actually there

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,320
was a kind of a remote code execution

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,930
mark in duplicator it's a famous plugin

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,430
which is used to work lacquer backing

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,680
things up and maybe cloning the word

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,880
passive if you are using this one better

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,070
to update it

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,539
yes do they have an issue yep and ninja

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,770
bombs are in a very famous one

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:26,720
it also recently had an issue with

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,810
constantly speaking and CSV injection

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,889
and they also touched it so if you are

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,469
in a good if you are in good

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:37,680
perhaps if you are bidding him I also

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:41,189
WordPress reasonable security update

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,159
recently because of them a bug in the

00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:47,249
coin set so if you are running this one

00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:49,050
better pÃºblica and it already updated

00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:51,360
for you because it's been giving your

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,460
security updates normal so there's a

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,129
project called Operation application

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,099
security project so they actually listed

00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:00,050
top ten security vulnerabilities in

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,870
WordPress

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:06,840
the first one is injection it's like SQL

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,930
encryption so it's like giving you

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,020
giving running some SQL rated commands

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:16,349
and getting data from your website and

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,919
maybe getting that your username and

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:23,189
passwords and a broken authentication so

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,409
so kind of a bug in there so this is the

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:27,089
top ten actually I'm going to fast on

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:30,569
this ones and we'll be giving some

00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:32,610
explanation you know and sensitive data

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,860
exposure is actually giving the user

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:41,550
names and other emails and or stuff

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:44,360
without even knowing it and there are

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,680
some other resources third-party and

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,469
using the external different entities

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,110
you get some other security issues

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:57,419
because of these things and it's going

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:58,889
to be six images combination sorry so

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,479
security mix the reason is that you

00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:05,129
actually set up the plugins on your

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,169
stuff wrong it's moved forward and the

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,300
cross lighting speaking is a normal but

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,909
you getting from many plugins and good

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,029
teams itself because you can run

00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:17,629
arbitrary JavaScript commands inside the

00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:22,909
website and get some information

00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:25,469
especially stored in a cookies also and

00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:29,180
you'd easier eyes with the insecure way

00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,180
that you can access the encrypted data

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:37,560
and you using components when we throw

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:39,599
all well-known Val abilities like some

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,909
plugins or plugins using some what

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,769
they're also projects with well

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,700
abilities most of the time actually

00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:50,130
related to XM

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:52,080
proxy and you don't have much

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,450
information on the logging and

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,120
monitoring like which actions actually

00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:00,060
occurred and who the one mixed response

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,950
word on these actions so these are the

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,900
top ten one actually study in there so

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,300
if you are know about this thing now if

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,270
you are okay with this thing that means

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,900
you're totally okay for now

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:17,730
there may be a new updates coming out so

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:20,850
how would Rio safely with a cop the

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,910
first one is actually continuous in

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,580
ruins

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,760
what is continuous improvement the thing

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,830
is you need to improve your vertical and

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,620
you need to improve about your team's

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,360
plugins but not enough you need to

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,280
improve about yourself or the knowledge

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,540
about CP really that's why you are here

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:47,610
right yeah so first thing is finally

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:51,180
secured Mustang the that means get a

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:54,270
good car not get an all car with some

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,830
special box and all stuff instead of is

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,160
get a good car like Tesla

00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:02,130
yeah even is pivot at some way it is but

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,460
they are good in a BD so final secured

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,780
costing the next thing is you and you

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:12,360
have a good cop don't forget to make it

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,960
you need to update the core themes and

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,700
all stuff

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:20,100
don't forget it update you just create

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,310
an application for customer and update

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,700
it upload it and just go away don't do

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,220
that

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,940
keeping outfitter can keep this website

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,450
updated so first thing is get the

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:37,290
WordPress of today keep your plugins and

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:40,770
themes update and change the password

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:43,350
period it's not your brush don't is much

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:47,000
often just change to get any one don't

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:51,570
you save the brush rush routines and

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,160
keep yourself updated just know about

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,540
what environment is coming on what are

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,690
the plugins one immunity is why they are

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,820
with aging

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,520
there's what are they in there so keep

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,830
yourself updated there are some security

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,860
edit blocks and if you can you can

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,660
follow some links in the end of this

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,290
session you can keep updated with what

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:14,560
added whatever it is coming up and next

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:17,590
thing is use your own not default

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:24,190
don't use whatever things that give them

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:25,960
you use you own ones like the first one

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,980
don't use admin as you're using it

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:34,660
everybody knows it's not ugly sorry get

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:37,300
some random one for you and you have a

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,470
WP config which is the one one of the

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,280
most important things in the world

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,210
procedure

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,510
so there has separate keys that in that

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,160
BB convict this is used to encrypt the

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:51,310
session and everything in the database

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,760
related to encryption so it has soils

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:57,940
nonce and all the security keys which

00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,090
you need how your order and imaginative

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,370
and where this has an URL and API to get

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:07,030
this random generated values you can put

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:09,910
in the depth and don't use WP underscore

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,580
critics everybody knows that normally

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,590
you use as a default on so use your own

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:19,510
one and critics don't use WP on the

00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:22,300
scope nothing is prevent use and in

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,340
regions like you go there and log in and

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,620
you put just some random usernames and

00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:31,020
clicking there or you go to the author's

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:34,210
page and get the list of users so try to

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:37,210
prevent using numeration have kind of a

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:40,080
CAPTCHA challenge or you can use kind of

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:44,140
a rewrite rule to stop the query screen

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:47,350
and next thing is don't forget about the

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:50,320
old ones if you don't use a news account

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,850
there any inactive users don't keep them

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,650
in the system because you also forget

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,290
that but you may also forget the

00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,400
passwords so and you don't know that

00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,650
this exists anymore

00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,180
so keep don't keep them in system just

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,490
delete that

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,920
users and and again they are forced into

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,580
a some other account or they had been

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,050
account and this thing is the one

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,830
actually I had a nightmare

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,570
so this Edmond xml-rpc if you are not

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,000
using most of them you won't be using

00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:21,330
this one so what happened was in my

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,410
experience so me harvesting twins about

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:27,959
ten sites of the pilots one light in the

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,930
same system and all actually hadn't

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:34,110
disabled xml-rpc and it's Friday so we

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:37,020
got a DDoS attack on one site which

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,430
makes the server but all will and the

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,950
server administrator actually shut down

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,320
all account so the ten sites actually

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,660
running their was down for about three

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,620
hours and most of science actually had

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:53,070
them really good reputation and it was

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,110
yeah it was a nightmare for me so it is

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,300
Getty sponsor experience you can

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,670
actually use a TX s to disable xml-rpc

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,149
or there are plugins available to just

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:06,150
disable this one so the this is the most

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:08,430
common places that get DDoS attacks so

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:12,480
people actually try to do the xml RPC

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:15,420
calls from a box and it will be making

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,529
new resource overwhelmed and you're

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,959
getting the processor usage very up and

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:25,589
DUI and this will be shot dead I don't

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,089
know she's using this red one that's why

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:29,730
I told me in the earlier slide get a

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:31,830
good hosting if you have a good roasting

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,510
with good resources then you don't need

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,370
to worry but if you have a shared one

00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,500
you need to be worried about these

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,050
things

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,910
the thing is disable finally dealing in

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,970
the world is batch mode why is that

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:47,550
important let's see if the some more you

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,950
actually get an access to use account in

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,200
some available they first try to change

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,910
the plugins and stuff using the

00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:00,540
WordPress dashboard so it's better to

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:04,320
turn this off so you will may get a less

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,700
amount of hacking if they use of combo

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,590
jacket and otherwise the result

00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,410
be very different because they can

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:14,740
change the plugins and make change on

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,600
the front end and will be kind of a

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,890
nightmare to get fixed it again also

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,050
because you don't know what the PI's

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,250
change its own there then you need to go

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:27,280
and do a give or chain few more things

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:30,370
the next thing is to limit the login

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,970
phenotypes then you are really good with

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,790
the brute-force attacks because if you

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:39,250
limit it like for failure types just

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,250
block the IP then brute force attacks

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,710
will be going to be going down otherwise

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,170
they will try to use multiple usernames

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,320
or multiple fasters and try to log in

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,180
time time so this is normally there

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,820
because there are many mods trying to

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,550
check your logins just try to do the

00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,320
would protect attacks and there are some

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,910
tools where you can check it how is that

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,540
acts going on and know how would you say

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:08,560
about these things and best thing is

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,690
this one this is more important backup

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,540
ready ready so if this some bad things

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:15,940
happen you haven't copied restore and go

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,720
start again if you don't have a backup

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:22,690
and you are you know catastrophic that

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,090
has to be so yeah you don't think about

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,950
it it's very hot yeah this what's

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,590
happened we know you was actually

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:32,470
starting now so this is one of first

00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:34,450
lessons I learned so yeah

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,880
normally I set up a backup resolution

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,670
from the server plus not using my

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,500
wordpress actually because it makes the

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,420
resource going up so I actually set up

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,430
in the capsule service from the server

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:50,230
itself so you back up all the thing with

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:52,090
the database and the files and use

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,910
two-factor authentication then you know

00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:56,620
somebody's according to login cases and

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,650
it is more secure if you are actually

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,900
doing kind of a media related things so

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,000
where you image really matters most so

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,449
be sure to use it to factor

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,500
authentication in you know that only is

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,720
authenticated presence is going to

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:15,400
do the kind of changes in the post or

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:19,600
the articles the other thing is use

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,459
plugins from trusted sources like

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,560
WordPress plug-in directory or something

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:27,060
else but if there's some sites saying

00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,400
that they have premium plugins for free

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,170
don't get into that trap they're not

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,510
giving you the free they will have some

00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,820
backdoor inside it so better to get it

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,040
from the trusted sources because it's

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,810
only one file and it is very open source

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,410
you can actually put it into a plug-in

00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:47,980
directory and it can open a completely

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,440
command line enable PHP back back though

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,850
so any one file you can actually it's

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,920
open source you can actually use it and

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:58,080
put it into the plug-in and give it to

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,080
somebody else who doesn't know it and

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,820
remove unused plugins and cubes since

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,230
they are unused you are not going to

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,810
update it or you don't know that it

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:11,560
exists anymore but it's still there in

00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,940
your file system so still the

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,130
vulnerabilities in that uh newest

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,230
plugins also matter matters to your

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,600
sub-site so and it is good for your

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:23,380
performance of the website also if you

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,240
remove the old unused money and better

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,200
should have very limited number of

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:32,560
plugins also rather than it has all much

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,330
of features in the plug-in a well placed

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,270
by in directory you don't click install

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,890
table everything will work aside so it's

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,300
better to have limited number of what

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:46,480
they are essential for yourself and turn

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,600
on comment approval so then you don't

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,410
get very how to do your CEO you we are

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,530
doing some research and in experts oh

00:18:52,410 --> 00:19:01,240
you don't get any drug brilliant at

00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:03,340
advertisements so if you are turned off

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,200
this comment turn on the community well

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,650
then you can see it can just be needed

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,010
for you some kind of a spam related

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:15,250
plugging to just delete these spam

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:17,140
comments which are opening in your

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,910
approval talks there was a site actually

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,930
a former client which actually had about

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:26,840
20,000 spam comments waiting in the

00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:29,060
approval box but after we actually you

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,800
said plug in on the spamming things it

00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,680
is going to be automatically remove

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,590
these plugins and take the same text

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,090
that comment has the spanning things so

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,150
they are going to block it anyway

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,950
without even coming to the Congress the

00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,520
other thing is in recently there's much

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,890
we can hype on this one so better to use

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,830
HTTP because now is very affordable not

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,440
like earlier time getting an assist is

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:57,230
pretty hard and it's very expensive but

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,760
even now yes service and I select let's

00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:03,440
encrypt you can get a free SSL

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:06,140
Certificates so why not use it even at

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,730
least for WP admin where you have the

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,770
password keys but if you are running an

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,010
e-commerce solution nobody have I won't

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,010
have it

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,790
this SSL King actually make you a secure

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,030
and apart from that if you are going to

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,400
buy and domain like dot app it's a

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:25,670
mandatory to have a TTP s in the domain

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,860
itself and if you're going to upload

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,310
yourself like plugins or change or you

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:34,760
have your own plugins use effective it

00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:37,130
not unencrypted FTP time use an

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,130
encrypted this tip 50 tunnel I think

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:42,650
most of the new hosting provider this

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,850
supporting so use kind of thin tip that

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,910
way to upload your files also the new

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,190
thing is that you can have an audit log

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:55,610
which make you easy to monitor which

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:57,770
user did what change till how that is

00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,780
going this user actually stored it

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,630
plug-in and they actually activated or

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,610
deactivated or this user went this way

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,920
and activate this feature in this planet

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,620
so then you know which which one is

00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,570
actually responsible for the changes in

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,690
if you have multiple persons actually

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,820
working on these projects then you know

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,290
what's happened even the client for the

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,880
some kind of change you can actually

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:24,110
make him responsible for that change and

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,810
this is especially for our little

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,630
developers in your production

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:32,000
application turn off the develop effects

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,990
if you I have all the errors it will be

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,790
show up your body

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,700
celebration and what your the PSP

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,610
version or stuff so you may be actually

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:44,150
forget to tell but tight up in the

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:46,429
production nerves and not only these

00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:50,210
things like road conditions apart from

00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:53,690
your WordPress its metals like Apache

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:56,300
PHP and nginx even a sister had

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,940
vulnerabilities and even will have other

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,910
minutes so you need to know about these

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,920
things if you don't have a managed

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,410
hosting account you have you almost

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,950
tinkle you need to take off what is on

00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:11,720
PHP errors what are the errors in nginx

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,940
so otherwise if you have a good+

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,370
provider they will take care of this one

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,450
so you not only need to worry about if

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:23,140
you are running your own hosting

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:26,059
solution and get some DDoS protection

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,179
there are some free free solution and

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:33,429
there are some paid positions they can

00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:37,610
use that as load better to make it

00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:39,980
protected from the DDoS attacks so since

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:43,040
I said many vulnerabilities exist how

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:47,320
are you going to know about them so this

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:51,050
is a a community project which calls WT

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,600
where every database they have all the

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:57,020
vulnerabilities listed down with

00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,400
specific chords so you can actually know

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,870
about what's wrong in there and all the

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,120
reported wanna build is in there and

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:10,309
they also have there's a fix or not

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,150
apart from that if you are very geeky

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:16,760
you can run it you on with so this is an

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:20,840
open source project where you can

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:23,120
actually use to attack your own websites

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,309
not attack actually it will be running

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,170
on your site and you get the enumerator

00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:29,890
and what is the things are running on

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:33,850
this is a recent

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:36,559
screenshot from the one camp view threat

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,230
so I run it here on

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,460
trip into the morning and we won't

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:46,249
forget about time stands still body so

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,460
it use the word press Russia is funny

00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:51,919
boy fest four point nine point nine and

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,559
alpha court so this is actually from

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,779
world camp and this actually version

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,990
itself from the WordPress so they have

00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:01,580
the recent question in there and there's

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:05,600
no will the way to finding that question

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,330
and this about this about robot.txt

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,610
there's a one is Christie and they said

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,470
that the readme file also present from

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,240
my point of view better to remove the

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,860
readme file also from your site because

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,399
it gives out your WordPress version and

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:24,559
you can show that it's finding 2073 so

00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:26,090
it's going on there and give you what

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,129
the teams arrived and there's no money

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,899
within the team and it's going to it ha

00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:33,259
you can see they have got another plugin

00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:35,840
and they have at aggregator WC post type

00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:40,100
complex and jetpack also there and the

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,480
using WP super cache so all the plugins

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,119
actually doesn't have any valve it is

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,190
where the version they are running so

00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,049
this tool is actually free and it's open

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,210
source you can just get it from the

00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,809
github and if you have a PHP runtime

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:57,019
with its can write in your command line

00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:58,700
and with your websites and then you can

00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:08,360
actually get the inside bodies from

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:14,149
inter website and you can update this

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:15,529
one of it is can it's open source and

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:17,659
you can actually contribute if you want

00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:21,559
and it's actually pulling the fun

00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:23,539
abilities from the previous pool so even

00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,330
if they identified version they will

00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:28,879
pull the what the one limit is available

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:31,159
in this database so it going to be

00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:34,690
compared with the website that you given

00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:37,159
you and it has different different

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,649
parameters you can pass the basic scan

00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:47,480
default scan and they are full deep scan

00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:50,869
also please take time to summary so if I

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:57,470
summarize the OT you need to don't

00:25:50,869 --> 00:26:02,750
forget to update use you on don't use

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:06,590
the default disabled XML PC if you are

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:12,799
not going to use it limit login attempts

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:15,980
and backup regularly that's the most

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:21,350
thing that I can tell you and the remove

00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:23,480
the unused plugins themes or keep it use

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,590
the secure connection use HTTPS or SSL

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,059
TB

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:30,559
SFTP and keep yourself updated about

00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:34,519
other vulnerabilities and what the

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,129
purpose things are going on and if you

00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:38,929
summarize this one one problem it's

00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,669
called continuous improvements so you

00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:43,039
really improve about yourself what's

00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:49,899
going on with the world and what your

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,899
infinite security and that's all folks

00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,360
thank you very much for having me a king

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:59,080
in this world and where can we tread

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,210
this I'm coming from Sri Lanka out all

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:10,030
day to here and thank you very much for

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:11,890
welcoming me here thank you if you have

00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:30,760
some questions I think yeah any

00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:32,590
questions I have some time the first

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,179
thing is that I told me a lot they use

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,340
the list number of blogging so if you

00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:38,679
want to have kind of things don't use

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,630
multiple things because it is going to

00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,059
reduce your performance they are going

00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,850
to use the scanning or stuff so she'll

00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,830
be running always so it will be harmful

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,990
for your performance

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:53,679
yeah I'm not going to recommend anything

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:58,210
in you yes but you can use a kind of

00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:01,210
about 1 1 plane to check your PI system

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:04,809
to have whatever it is on earth

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:07,690
so then alert you on this one and you

00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:11,650
can a kind of use a firewall to block

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:14,890
all the like what they are a database

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:17,559
with the boat IPS which are going to

00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,960
normally put dude force attacks on your

00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,400
login page so you can actually lock them

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,070
using separate plugins

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,040
no there are some good plugins which

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,020
have this oil thing in as one package so

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,059
you can actually enable that one then

00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:34,450
we'll be going to limit your logins and

00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:36,910
they're going to load the things what is

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,590
going on with the site and they will

00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,019
give you the updates thing what needs to

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,909
be

00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:44,639
like this plugin needed of better now

00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:47,519
please send an alert for you

00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:51,989
so they plug it but my recommendation is

00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:55,109
just yeah install all of them in a demos

00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:57,929
over and get some insight on it and

00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:59,059
choose one that support you best use

00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:22,529
case

00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:24,749
don't use multi yeah but I said what is

00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:28,320
what kept speaker I cannot recommend it

00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:35,279
plugins here but maybe after the session

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:37,289
you can experience because it's not good

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,749
as I speaker to recommend anything it

00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:41,749
will be biased because I I advise that

00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:52,139
we heist in time we do have some time

00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:54,090
are there any other question sir don't

00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:56,280
be shy

00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:59,000
yeah I'm going that con man is no better

00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,000
to ask questions

00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:24,720
yeah it's written here if you know what

00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,820
you're doing is totally fine but it is

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,620
actually a 3 is actually kind of an XML

00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:33,150
format so you can actually inject

00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,830
something into that file also and you

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,340
can actually inject some files that

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:40,260
makes break even your plugins also like

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,420
if you're running a plug-in that makes

00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,490
you compress the images sometimes it

00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:48,720
will try to run it on the XP T and it

00:30:44,490 --> 00:31:10,290
has a malformed text actually mean yeah

00:30:48,720 --> 00:31:12,660
to break the plug-in yeah but as I said

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:16,410
that XML file is in the inside the SVG

00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:23,730
format so if you actually uploaded by a

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:25,670
wonderful file will be still there but a

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,840
serious feel good for the performance

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,910
because it's support multiple

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,400
resolutions I'll stop because it's a

00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,810
vector format so it's good for the

00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,350
performance we could equally be a very

00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,350
