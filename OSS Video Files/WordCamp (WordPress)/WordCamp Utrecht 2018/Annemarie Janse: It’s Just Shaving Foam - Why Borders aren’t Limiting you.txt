Title: Annemarie Janse: It’s Just Shaving Foam - Why Borders aren’t Limiting you
Publication date: 2020-04-05
Playlist: WordCamp Utrecht 2018
Description: 
	For long I was dreaming of starting my own business and traveling a lot. But I had to pay my monthly mortgage, loved the security of a permanent contract and thought that a comfortable house was essential to live a happy life.
Until I dared to leave everything behind, start my own business as a Virtual Assistant, work location independent and travel the world.
Now I go where I want to go, make a living of all sorts of online business support, of which building WordPress websites is one of the core activities.
Now I know that all fears that kept me happy with my permanent contract were just imaginary borders.

very much for coming

00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,890
I'd like to start with a small into

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,890
video that's introducing the Wintle

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,080
[Music]

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:38,840
[Music]

00:01:41,560 --> 00:03:19,180
[Music]

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,700
so yeah this was a small introduction so

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,100
what I would like to tell you and I

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:31,250
would like to share with you something

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,200
about shaving foam and you might wonder

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,800
why I should go to talk about shaving

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,020
folk what has it to do with WordPress

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,690
now this gives already a small idea

00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,940
small int into what I mean with shaving

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,520
foam and in the end I'm sure you all

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,500
know what I mean with it and I hope you

00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,280
will see some things in your life a

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,680
shaving foam as well this is quite a

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,750
personal talk about yeah things that

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,050
happened in my life especially at last

00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,050
year

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,750
for a long time I was living the life

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:13,000
that I was expected to live I didn't

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,230
like it that much but yeah I did what

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,830
everyone does I did a study I started

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:27,160
working I bought a house I booked some

00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:30,910
nice holidays but to be honest it didn't

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,000
make me very happy but yeah I thought

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,100
this is what everyone does so yeah I

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,430
have to accept it this is the normal

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:44,770
life so yeah just continue and find a

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,710
solution put in the way you are living

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:51,310
now within the system maybe I could buy

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:54,820
a bigger house by great stuff for that

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:58,510
house maybe that will make me happy or

00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,480
yeah I'm a woman so why not buying lots

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:05,230
of shoes clothes back jewels and other

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,320
stuff as much as possible every month or

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,210
maybe I should try to get in a brand new

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,250
company car maybe that will make me

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,919
happy

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:18,330
oh maybe I should go to an exotic

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,930
holiday so we are far from Europe or

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:25,720
maybe it's time for a new career step

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,240
and it will give me more fulfillment in

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,790
my life or maybe it's time for a

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,530
management training or I should go out

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:36,090
for a drink with my friends more often

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,830
maybe that will make me more happy and

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,050
if this all doesn't help maybe it's time

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,900
for a coach think almost everyone has a

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,960
coach now then sold why isn't it

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,870
something for me to help me or I should

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,530
follow a workshop about happiness or

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,750
maybe it's just the shoes buy more shoes

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:58,510
I read a book about flow thought maybe I

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,620
can find flow when I read this book and

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,600
that will help me in my work

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,970
so find real flow or I should just start

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,210
dreaming about travelling more because I

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,889
really love travelling

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,400
I know that makes me happy but yeah I

00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:15,110
had a job so not that many days off but

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,630
if I start dreaming about travelling

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:22,190
maybe that's what helped me and if this

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:25,580
all isn't enough maybe you can follow a

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:29,530
simple online course about running a

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,180
business while traveling I learned about

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,460
digital nomads that are travelling and

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,440
working all the time they work location

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,500
independent so they can travel as much

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,660
as they like but to me it seemed the big

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,030
step so I decided to follow a small

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,160
online training just to think a bit

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:49,130
about it not to really take that step

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,590
because I didn't have to do so but yeah

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:58,000
if I follow a small online course I can

00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,000
maybe dream a bit more about it so I did

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:08,870
but wow that makes such an impact on me

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:11,120
that's no course and why all of a sudden

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,280
I realized I don't want to continue this

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,570
way of life even if it's the life that

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:21,409
I'm expected to live I knew I don't want

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:24,320
it it was a feeling that I had was

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:26,690
hidden inside me and because of that

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,680
small online course I realized more and

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:32,780
more I want to change my life and start

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,210
traveling and step out of the standard

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:41,720
system I couldn't ignore that any longer

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:44,930
and I decided just to take the big step

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,169
to leap and to regard everything I was

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,639
going to do as an experiment because if

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:52,280
you see everything you do as an

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,830
experiment nothing can go wrong whatever

00:07:52,280 --> 00:08:00,199
will happen it's just the outcome of

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:03,080
your experiments so what was I going to

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,360
do I stepped out of the system and I did

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,840
many things that I never thought I could

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,580
do I love my house I have a very nice

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,220
house here

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,260
Utrecht I really loved it but I rented

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:21,220
it out for the year I'm out of 40 but I

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:24,040
decided to sleep in hostel dorms most of

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:28,720
people were around 2022 and that was me

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,670
but I did it and I loved it I decided to

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,330
start my own business building WordPress

00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:36,130
sites there's the WordPress although I

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,390
didn't have that much experience with

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,310
WordPress with running a business as I

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,440
told you before it was a Shopaholic and

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,660
a fashion addicts but I decided to take

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,130
only one backpack with some clothes some

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:53,410
shoes and that was all I had during my

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:57,640
six-month journey to South America last

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,530
winter I'm really a control freak

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,690
but I didn't plan that much I bought a

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:06,340
single ticket to Lima that was all our

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,680
plans and I loved it I've traveled by

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,200
bus very much I often get motion

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,760
sickness but yeah I thought let's grab a

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,630
bus because I want to travel by public

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,630
transport

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,510
I hate routine and at the same time I

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,810
know how good it is in your life with a

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:30,460
choice places every five days for six

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:32,740
months I used to live on my own but I

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,590
had hardly and a privacy when we were

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:41,950
sleeping in hostel dorms then you should

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:44,050
forget about privacy and it was so

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,620
amazing because I did so many things

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,600
that I never expected I could do and now

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,010
that I'm back many people are asking me

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,600
what this did is step teach you gonna

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,530
teach me a lot and that's what I would

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,150
like to share with you one of the things

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,120
that I learned is that home is

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,970
everywhere I thought I'm so much in love

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,009
in Utrecht with my house I can never

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,319
live somewhere else but I learned that

00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,839
home is not just a building home is

00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:17,920
something it's a yeah it's something of

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,889
feeling happy feeling comfortable and I

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,290
learned that I needed about 24 hours to

00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:24,970
feel at home in a new place at the other

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,019
side of the world on a place I've never

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,579
been before

00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:33,670
but it's just for me a matter of time I

00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:36,430
need a bed of course a shower my

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,879
backpack put some stuff and something to

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,060
eat

00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:43,060
and I'm a coffee addict so comfy means

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,310
the world to me and as long as all those

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:49,980
things are in place I could feel at home

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,980
wherever I am somewhere in this world

00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:59,889
and now I love the idea of minimalism

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,259
yeah maybe in the Western world we were

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:04,930
focused a lot on having lots of stuff

00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:08,769
that looks nice that's according to the

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:11,350
trends and at every one it was visiting

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:14,740
our house love submerge says only for

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:17,439
nice house nice stuff but in the end it

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,540
has nothing to do with a good life it's

00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:21,879
not important at all

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,029
life is about experiences and that's

00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:28,689
what I really learned during my journey

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,730
in South America I had a great time but

00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:33,730
I had nothing with me apart from my

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,410
small backpack but I didn't miss

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,980
anything of the stuff that I had

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,300
collected before because I thought

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,769
before I started traveling that that the

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,769
most important to give me a good life

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,050
the third thing that I learned is as I

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,649
mentioned before trying is living as

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,939
long as you see many steps that you take

00:11:53,649 --> 00:12:01,110
as an experiments nothing can go wrong

00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:04,629
as I told you a loved control security

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,379
organizing but I experienced that I can

00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:10,070
live without it quite well and maybe

00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:13,430
yeah after one month I would

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:16,370
come back home because I miss my house

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,230
and this my my standard life but yeah

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,830
okay then it would have been the outcome

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,480
of my experiments the third thing that I

00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,410
would have learned was okay this sort of

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,410
life is not for me

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:36,350
taking these steps yeah it was I didn't

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:38,360
dare to do that but if you see things as

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,010
an experiment then you can do many

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,190
things and nothing can go wrong

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,960
so if you're thinking about taking big

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,120
steps in your life you don't know if

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,980
it's something for you just tell

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,380
yourself it's an experiment and then you

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:56,150
can do everything the biggest things are

00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:01,460
learnt and there's the shaitaan' phone

00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:03,170
is that yeah the system how we're used

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,160
to lived here in the Western world's

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:10,490
what is regarded as a normal life a

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,280
standard career if your head would it

00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,960
it's okay but if you feel unhappy f di D

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,710
I want to do something else I want to

00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:22,100
change my life just step out of it

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:26,290
it's only shaving foam the end that the

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,880
referees use in the in the soccer

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,680
it's just shaving foam that keeps you

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,920
where you are there's no reason why you

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,590
can step out of the standard life there

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,580
is no real border is nothing that's

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:42,680
really limiting you or that what helps

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,810
you from doing what you want to do it's

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,820
just shaving foam you can step over it

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:50,270
it's nothing you think it's something

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,010
big you shouldn't do it but in the end

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:56,950
you can do whatever you like to do

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:59,390
because it's just a shaving foam border

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,710
the other thing is what I learned is

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,180
that you're not defined by your

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,100
character and preferences of course you

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,620
know yourself you know what's important

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,720
to you what you like very much like I

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,149
thought I liked

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,899
like my house I like being an organized

00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:19,300
person I'm a control freak show paddocks

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,879
but it doesn't define me even if you're

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,430
over 40 you can change your life you can

00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:26,079
change your way of living

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:29,579
you can leave things behind that you've

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:33,189
always seen as very important to you and

00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:37,029
therefore I'm sure you can do what you

00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:39,519
never expected you could do so never

00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,500
believe you can't change your life and

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,470
live a different life it's only shaving

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,060
foam that keeps you doing what you do so

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,189
just step over it and if there's

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,579
something that you think okay I'm

00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:53,800
doubting is it okay can I do it in my

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:57,120
life realize maybe it's just shaving

00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:06,610
foam and see if you can step over it

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:08,410
okay thank you very much

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,709
