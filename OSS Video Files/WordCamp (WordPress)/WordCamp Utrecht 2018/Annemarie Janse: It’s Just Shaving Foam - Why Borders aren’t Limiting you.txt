Description: 
	For long I was dreaming of starting my own business and traveling a lot. But I had to pay my monthly mortgage, loved the security of a permanent contract and thought that a comfortable house was essential to live a happy life.
Until I dared to leave everything behind, start my own business as a Virtual Assistant, work location independent and travel the world.
Now I go where I want to go, make a living of all sorts of online business support, of which building WordPress websites is one of the core activities.
Now I know that all fears that kept me happy with my permanent contract were just imaginary borders.
