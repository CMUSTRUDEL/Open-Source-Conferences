morning sorry about that

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,010
filthy son as Ford said my name

00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,580
Whitman with stefan generis WP engine

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,170
out of based out of florida i've no

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,160
corporate florican trip chair i'm a

00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,130
speaker

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,750
i've taught computer science blogger

00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,520
i've had a whole lot of roles in the

00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,439
WordPress community including one of the

00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,170
first plugins sales to a loser company I

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,900
sold better WP security I've taught this

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,880
stuff for a long time and I typically

00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,380
exercise typically speak on security or

00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,850
privacy which hasn't been it's been an

00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,340
interest in Smythe day as an airline

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,040
pilot which happened to be 9/11 there's

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,810
a great career sign let me tell you but

00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,540
I've been around the WordPress world

00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,700
though for about 10 years now and mostly

00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,920
teaching on security privacy things like

00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,390
that today's talk those about where

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,730
we've been is WordPress and where we're

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,310
going with WordPress specifically with

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,930
things such as Gutenberg what the future

00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,610
of the software is where the community

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,830
is going a little bit with along with

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,810
that software and in order to talk about

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,700
where we're going the first step is of

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,310
course where we've been with this

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,810
software where we've been there's two

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,610
things where the community has been and

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,689
where the WordPress software itself has

00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,970
been so let's talk a little bit about

00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,620
where it's wordpress has been this is

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,750
the growth chart a wordpress and percent

00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,310
of roughly the entire internet it's the

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,620
percentage of the top ten million

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,840
websites on the internet that use

00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,760
WordPress one interesting thing about

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,580
this is instead of this line dropping

00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,380
it's actually growing a little bit

00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,680
faster this last year so we're up to

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,390
absolutely October 22nd we're up to

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,930
thirty two point one percent of the

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,510
entire internet runs on WordPress that's

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,860
a lot of the internet it's even better

00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:52,190
it looks even better when you compared

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,950
to the competition these are the top

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:58,580
seven content management systems on the

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,619
entire internet so the next closest

00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,090
thing is Joomla I have a lot of good

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,680
friends who used to work at you might be

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,500
honest I don't know anybody who works in

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,790
Joomla today I'm there are people out

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,549
there it's a number two content

00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,980
management system but the scale of

00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:14,420
installs is so vast that it's actually

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,340
harder much harder to find somebody that

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,799
works and even the number two compared

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,540
to something like WordPress

00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:22,500
of course if WordPress is going that

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,110
quickly is there even room to grow

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,000
and yes there is the top content

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,630
management system on the web is still no

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,980
cuts no content management system at all

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,680
but WordPress is kind of conquering that

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,330
one the line especially this last year

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,100
where the liens really start to converge

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,420
or telling so there's an awful lot of

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,970
potential going on here

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,130
but still 46% of the entire Internet

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,230
doesn't use a content management system

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,760
at all these might be flat file

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,340
generators if you use something like

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,530
Jekyll oftentimes they're going to be

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,380
counted as no content management system

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,730
but some simple HTML sites there's still

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,530
an awful lot of that stuff going on

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,420
there single page sites and other things

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,739
that are happening and it's a heck of a

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,060
lot of opportunity for WordPress

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,390
especially as we move into things like

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,510
Gutenberg as well as WordPress does with

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,010
the current text editor trying to create

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,450
the layouts for a lot of these sites

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,760
that are still known content management

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,140
system art is very difficult today and

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,959
that's where a lot of the opportunity

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,850
relies in Gutenberg that's where the

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,820
software's been and then there's also

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,530
WordPress the community the community I

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,810
want to emphasize who is not the

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,299
ecosystem of WordPress WordPress is

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,280
still at its core a tool even in this

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,840
talk of divided WordPress the tool Lord

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,670
press the software from WordPress the

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,440
community they're very different things

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,510
the ecosystem is the combination of

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,190
everything we have going on where's the

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,630
compute that the community itself is

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,640
that the people that are working on

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,080
everything all the different aspects of

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,510
the community whether it be the

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,160
Netherlands WordPress community whether

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,170
it be the South Florida WordPress meetup

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,470
group which happens to be my home meetup

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:58,799
where it can't be you different products

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,180
gravity forms give WP Genesis these are

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,130
all different communities we've heard of

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,110
and as you scroll down the list if we

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,030
can't anybody here that's on Facebook or

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,610
Twitter or anything we see these

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,890
communities really in a more pronounced

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,200
fashion on things like Facebook the

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,269
advanced WordPress meetup group the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,030
WordPress hosting meetup group the

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,650
WordPress security meetup group and all

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,150
the slack channel I know I don't know

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,919
about y'all how many people in here are

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,750
on slack in one fashion or another for

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,680
work so little more than half the room

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,270
I was out to 24 different slack teams

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,180
the week before I said when I switched

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,170
to this computer a couple weeks ago

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,400
immediately I need to clean some of

00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,560
those out but most of them are different

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,810
WordPress communities from security to

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,000
privacy to all the different types of

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,970
areas I focused my attention on over the

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,560
last couple of years and that's where

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,530
WordPress is going is it's been it's

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,110
been involving for 15 years now the 15th

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:56,530
anniversary of WordPress as WordPress

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,000
itself happened this past May before

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,190
WordPress it was actually another

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,020
project called b2 Cafe Press that was

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,970
dead Matt Mullenweg had forked back in

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:09,100
2003 so this is a long time long-running

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,950
evolving project that still has a long

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,140
way to go and of course the big thing

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,380
the immediate where we're going then

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,730
becomes WordPress 5.0 which is

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,890
officially supposed to launch in less

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,930
than a month we have the first beta came

00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,340
out I think it was Wednesday it's a

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,440
couple day it was a couple days late was

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,570
due out the 19th of October I think it

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,460
was the 24th that it actually launched

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,040
but that first beta is leading up to

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,720
WordPress 5.0 and especially this

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,229
Gutenberg editor Gutenberg is replayed

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,640
the tiny MCE editor that you're used to

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,410
Gutenberg replaces all of it it's gonna

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,880
replace the way we work with content

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,160
it's going to replace the way we work

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,440
with pages we work with menus we work

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,530
with widgets we work with plugins the

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,870
way we work with themes everything with

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,520
the WordPress Gutenberg editor is simply

00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,800
different it's the next evolution of

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,060
work for us instead of using your

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,220
widgets now we're going to have things

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,140
like blocks for layout which allows a

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,450
whole lot of new opportunities to work

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,100
for us think of it as an app store right

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,460
now you go out and you install an app on

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,680
your phone and plugins somewhat fulfill

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,110
that role over the years we can install

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,900
gravity forms we can install caldera

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,010
forms whatever it might be

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,280
however with block soup we can take this

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,350
even to the next level if we need a SAS

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,110
product we're working with Salesforce

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,090
who are working with our payment gateway

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,590
there could be a block for this you go

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,440
out you can download the block is a

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,240
install it similar to a plugin and just

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,430
put the block in your site as a new

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,970
almost entirely

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:44,340
style of an app so it's a very richer

00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,340
ecosystem for much more fine-grained

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,530
controls I mean how many giant plugins

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,020
do we have now if we want the feature of

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,700
a contact form we wind up with a plugin

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,780
that gives us a content form spam

00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:00,210
control you name it a little hover cards

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,830
when we hover over things there's you

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,130
know maybe 50 features in some of these

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,870
plugins one of the benefits of Gutenberg

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,600
will be the ability to install this

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,430
feature as a single item get exactly

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
what your need with it and not have to

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,750
worry about all the corrupt which

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,040
includes training maintenance and all

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,540
the other things that go along with some

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,960
of these giant plugins in the way that

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,370
we've done WordPress for so long another

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,440
big advantage of this tool is content is

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,150
still portable there's a lot of good

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,890
page builders out there that have kind

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,930
of filled this role for many years now

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:35,660
beaver builders Elementor divvy these

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,710
are great products in and of themselves

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,110
but one of their big weaknesses has

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,590
always been content portability if

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,150
you've built

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,030
anybody who's built a site in Divi or

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,570
Avada if you want to remove that product

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,590
later on it becomes very difficult

00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,940
Gutenberg handles a lot of that

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,860
everything's actually just stored as

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,480
post content with some markup in it it's

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,730
a very different way of looking at

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,340
content than anybody's tried before with

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,110
this type of thing it's so flexible in

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,970
fact that one of the biggest markets

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:07,650
right now for Gutenberg blocks is Drupal

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,060
the Drupal CMS is one of the biggest

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,920
markets out there and one of the best

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,850
going markets for Drupal or Gutenberg

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,920
blocks right now

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,810
that's how portable this technology is

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,250
becoming so that's not saying something

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,960
you know WordPress is mission has always

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,810
been to democratize the web

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,950
we're democratizing the democratizing

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,440
the web doesn't necessarily mean

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,840
WordPress as a core database it means

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,610
democratizing the web period Gutenberg

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,670
is a very big step in that direction

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,370
just in the fact that Drupal in

00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,900
particular but also I've heard of Joomla

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,180
communities looking at it for various

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,099
items and other systems are looking

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,860
at Gutenberg did incorporate into their

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,839
own system it's kind of like tiny MCE

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,110
was which tiny MCE is the current editor

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,300
way back when it was adopted about 1213

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,950
years ago but now with a whole new level

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,800
of being able to make this data portable

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,000
available and granular just the way we

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,510
need you know the way your customers

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,730
need to use it it is very JavaScript

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,810
heavy it's based in react.js which is a

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,839
little bit different than what we've

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,730
been doing before and also it's

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,380
currently well as I wrote these slides

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,480
the other week it was currently a plugin

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,010
entirely you actually had to go out to

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,770
the plugins Store and install Gutenberg

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,899
with the release of WordPress 5.0 beta

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,839
one it is included as the default editor

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,490
now and when WordPress 5.0 is released

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,940
it will be the default editor for

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,490
WordPress 5.0 its feature already as of

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:32,550
version 4.1 which was about a week ago

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,800
so as quickly as WordPress 5.0 is coming

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,959
along Gutenberg itself was only feature

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,459
already about a week ago so that should

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,440
tell you something about where the state

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,850
of bugs and things are if you were to

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,890
try this and that is something I have to

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,660
warn you about what the thing is feature

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,160
ready so if you were gonna try to if you

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,200
have clients that you're gonna launch in

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,580
December if you have a client you're

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,589
gonna launch in January and you're

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,480
working on this site now it's a really

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,820
good time to get yourself familiar and

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,070
get your clients familiar because it is

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,450
ready things are not going to change in

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,610
the way that it sits that you're working

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,860
with it from what we have right now like

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:08,250
I say and it's the final release is

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,850
slated for right before Black Friday the

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:14,000
19th of November so take that as you

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,589
will the Ted is what it's released to

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,290
kind of give you an idea how big this

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,029
project already has been originally they

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,120
wanted this to be on a hundred thousand

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:26,579
sites 250,000 posts before they were

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,550
considered merging it as of one man

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:31,140
wrote that a month ago Matt Mullenweg is

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,180
the founder of the WordPress project

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,890
he's the CEO of automatically

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,720
he's been around this stuff a long time

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,910
but their numbers were four hundred and

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,100
twenty thousand sites as of a month ago

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,020
or running to Bieber so there is

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,579
adoption of this thing already there is

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,730
a lot of eyes on it there's a lot of

00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,800
things going on with it and it is going

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,560
to improve a lot of things the improved

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,009
editing

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,139
really is kind of amazing I there's a

00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:59,170
lot it's different if you are you very

00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:01,360
used to typing in Microsoft Word this is

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,730
different this is not gonna look like

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,620
what you're used to working on but as

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,509
you most people who are new to the

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,639
system Moodle WordPress and just have

00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:11,889
already started with Gutenberg heaven

00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,959
are not familiar with the old stuff find

00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:15,189
it very much more difficult to go back

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,660
and everything I've seen

00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:18,779
then people it is for the news for

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,680
people to go forward into the new stuff

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,089
it's gonna allow like I said before it's

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,730
gonna allow easier integrations to other

00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,300
services when we're dealing with

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,769
JavaScript when we're dealing with

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,660
things that were not pulling things into

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,449
the database and we can go directly out

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,220
and integrate with other services it

00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:35,019
becomes a much easier thing to integrate

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,089
like say your your payment gateway may

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:38,980
be a different type of content form

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,720
different types of social media posts

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,259
whatever it might be the integrations

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,569
available with us are amazing also rapid

00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:49,420
site building the difference between

00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:52,089
pages posts other forms of content are

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,800
going to virtually disappear if you can

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,209
have a block that might indicate for

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,309
instance if you are working for a school

00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:58,899
and you had a block that indicated each

00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:01,269
teacher's name that you just put on the

00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:02,649
content and arranged in a menu that's a

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,899
lot easier than trying to figure out

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,550
well if I go to staff over here and then

00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,920
I put this page over here and put this

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,620
widget over there everything's in one

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,850
place now the training think about how

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,309
you're training your users and your

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,899
train your content editors we're we're

00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:19,269
in this room because we're familiar with

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,579
WordPress oftentimes that's not the case

00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,959
of our clients or our customers so the

00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:24,699
ability to train people and make sure

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,160
everything's in one place and make it

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:28,629
easier for them to edit the content they

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,850
need is really going to be kind of

00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:32,620
amazing and that is going to lead to

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,990
much easier adoption for newbies

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,879
WordPress users WordPress has been an

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,500
easy sale for many of us for a long time

00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,269
because of the available integrations

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,079
because of things like gravity forms

00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:45,459
because of the miniature the market is

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:47,249
the ability to now take this to the next

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:49,929
level and make it easier for our users

00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:51,670
it's gonna really help us step up that

00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:53,199
goal it's it's now it's not so much

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,120
about what's easier for us as a tool

00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,339
it's what's easiest for our users to

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,290
actually edit things in and if they're

00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,470
coming from something like Drupal if

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,900
they're already using gluten

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,940
your jobs done for you it's already sold

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,890
baby you worked with the stuff already

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,770
so now you can use the tools that you

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,750
know WordPress whatever WordPress

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,700
add-ons you might use and integrate that

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,560
all together with a much easier sale for

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,340
your customer a much nicer experience

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,710
for them and of course blocks and

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,630
Gutenberg editor is actually stage one

00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,920
the next phase is of modernizing

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,480
WordPress are going to include things

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,760
like widgets and menus which I believe

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,280
is phase two there's gonna be things

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,140
like themes there's even been a quote by

00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,850
Matt Mullenweg that phase four of the

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,530
modernization of WordPress the Gutenberg

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,820
Project could be core multilingual in

00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,200
this room I would mention that's a much

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,180
bigger deal than for someone like myself

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,550
because that's always been a plug in and

00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,070
how many of those plugins wpml is a

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,360
great plugin Babel is a great plugin but

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,890
how many of us have fought with those

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,170
plugins over the years and term in order

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,820
to try to keep things going the ability

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,890
to have that McClure is supported in

00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,800
core where all your plugins all your

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,320
blocks can use in core multilingual

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,420
assuming that does go in for that is a

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,340
quote you can find him on WP tether and

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,050
say in that but it's not an official

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,420
item there's no official roadmap there

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,850
but if that was to go in core the ease

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,200
of use for international users for

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,330
people that aren't from the United

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,870
States or not English first countries is

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:24,740
just amazing there's a lot of potential

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,240
there's still questions when I was asked

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,130
to do this talk when I was speaking with

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,050
the organizers about this talk one of

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,370
the things was oh forget Gutenberg I'm

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,350
tired of hearing this I'm tired of

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,080
hearing the problems there there's still

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,730
issues the probably the core issue that

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,580
we're going to hear the most about and

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,650
this room in particular has some very

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,320
big people involved with this issue are

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,760
the accessibility issues right now in

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,220
the United States if you work for a

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,930
university we can't use Gutenberg I just

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,150
left the University of Florida last

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,130
month so I've only been working with WP

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,510
engine for a little while we have you

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,130
they're scrapping their gutenberg

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:02,540
integration right now at the university

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:04,340
of florida it's not accessible yet we

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,590
are because the universities are

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,699
required by law and depending on where

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,139
your country is depending

00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,989
what industry you're in here if you have

00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,850
accessibility requirements by law you

00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:16,819
may not be able to go Guttenberg on

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:20,389
November 19th that's not to say it's not

00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:22,459
coming people are working on this

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,040
WP campuses agreed to sponsor an

00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,689
accessibility audit there there's a call

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,459
for proposals out right now to make sure

00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:30,589
that there are covering all the bases

00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:33,189
but this is an issue we have to think

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,720
about at the moment it's still buggy

00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:38,809
it's not released yet it's not

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,850
production software its beta software so

00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:43,100
if you put this on your clients primary

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,589
site right now they're gonna find bugs

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,989
notice I didn't have any screenshots of

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,429
this there's a reason for that every

00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:52,129
time I tried to make a screenshot on my

00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:55,100
linux computer here some sort of bug it

00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:56,869
was just weird graphics glitches as I

00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,790
was searching for screenshots I tend to

00:15:56,869 --> 00:16:02,419
find it was all people screenshotting

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,189
weird bugs and graphic glitches it's not

00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,139
quite ready for primetime however there

00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:08,419
are a lot of people using it there's

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,129
still a learning curve the editor

00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:11,509
learning curve if you have a user that's

00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:13,160
been writing in WordPress for the last

00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:14,419
10 years a blogger there's a learning

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,059
curve there it's going to take them a

00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:19,309
couple of hours if you're a developer

00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,379
that's been writing PHP for the last 10

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,449
years there's a learning curve there

00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:26,480
that's gonna take you a couple of months

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,799
if not weeks there's a quite the

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,209
learning curve on the code side of

00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,369
things this is using something called a

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,669
reaction yes WordPress is always

00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:37,910
typically been PHP HTML a little bit of

00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:40,369
CSS and JavaScript on top now javascript

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,049
is first so that is going to be a

00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:44,470
learning curve for your agency or for

00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:47,269
your shop that's building stuff for

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,829
integration with existing sites if you

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:51,139
have a site with 50 plugins in there and

00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:53,809
it's all custom code it's gonna take a

00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:56,179
while to get that code up to speed data

00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:58,789
portability if your data isn't something

00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:01,579
like Avada Divi that's a pick up pick on

00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:02,989
these plugins they're great products but

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,459
if you're already using one of them to

00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,569
try to get the data convert it over to

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:09,649
some of this it's gonna take a little

00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,850
bit of time and project updates tends to

00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:13,789
be one of the biggest things I hear of a

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,620
concern right now typically WordPress

00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:17,419
historically has had a very rigid we do

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,069
not put new features in a doc release

00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:21,060
right now we're four point nine point

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,980
eight that point eight should never be

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,990
to feature finance on admission for

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,050
point nine point six was huge slew of

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,090
new features for Gutenberg so if you're

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,580
working for enterprise a large company

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,620
that relies on stable and predictable

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,780
upgrade cycles there's a little bit of a

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,630
question right now these are all issues

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,310
that is greatest Gutenberg is we do have

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,200
to think about so I do want to make sure

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,690
that they're put out there however all

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,120
of these issues are being slowly worked

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,400
through it's not like the core team

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,960
doesn't know about them it's just not

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,430
quite there yet it but again the product

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,330
hasn't released yet either so it's

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,510
something to think about

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,560
and we see all kinds of things this I

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,390
would agree with because currently

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,100
Gutenberg sucks here's the problem of

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,260
collective thinking it automatic there's

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,030
the range of this if you search for

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,280
Gutenberg on the web this was just a

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,380
tweet search I did the other day I tried

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,510
to get this as close to this as close to

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,980
today as possible as I updated this but

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,720
there's also a lot of positive going on

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,020
if you're using a CMS Holy Gutenberg

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,020
already if you're using I believe

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,430
gravity forms is added or closed you

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,530
let's I believe you guys are Gutenberg

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,390
ready at this point more and more of

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,400
this is coming online again it's still

00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,780
not released so that everybody's still

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,090
kind of working out their integrations

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,010
but things are coming along great quite

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,020
well regardless of what you see the

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,510
people who have tried it and you know if

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,220
you've tried it your plugins not ready

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,600
for it people get mad you see an awful

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,850
lot of tweeting you see a lot of social

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,230
media response on the bed but not a

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,990
whole lot of it on the good side of

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,430
things this stuff I see from people I

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,260
try to introduce this to come tends to

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,240
go more like this I blog for the first

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,340
time when I actually try using it okay

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,630
it takes a little bit there are some

00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,970
bugs and it does take a little getting

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,100
used to but the writing experience the

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,290
user experience is better than what you

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,210
had before and that's really the the

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,860
pinnacle of this it will be easier

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,510
training it will be an easier experience

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,210
compared to what you have with the

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,140
onboarding from what you've had

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,530
previously when trying to introduce a

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,870
customer to WordPress and again editor

00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,970
is phase one just because we're done

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,220
with the editor Gutenberg project as a

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,440
whole the modernization of WordPress is

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,440
not complete the next step will be

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,750
widgets and menus so instead of having a

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,680
separate image of widget widget

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,850
and

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,820
menu editor need a little more feet a

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,140
little more crappie this morning is that

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,550
I have been a separate editor for each

00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,260
these are going to be moved into the

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,180
block system so you'll have menu blocks

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,340
you'll have widget blocks and things

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,720
like that beyond that that we're then

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,240
they're talking about theme and plug-in

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,030
API is being converted to being to being

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,410
more useful with blocks there's a lot of

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,960
things going on as things move forward

00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,430
so we're in the very early stages of the

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,260
modernization of WordPress but it's

00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:05,160
coming and it's really gonna be a

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,690
improved experience so then who is gonna

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,790
use this stuff what's the whole point

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,140
why bot why do I bother doing this you

00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,850
you hear this stuff about backwards

00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,280
compatibility WordPress still supports

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,860
five point PHP five point two which has

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,210
been dead for close to ten years now it

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,590
still supports other you know there's

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,760
there's been a whole lot of legacy we

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,130
don't want to up grace so why the

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,950
upgrade thing now and it's because

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,230
there's so many opportunities right now

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,540
WordPress has always been blogs then

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,360
small businesses now it's becoming

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,650
bigger and bigger in the enterprise

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,360
WordPress was always developers and site

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,920
admins you know that the freelancer was

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,380
building sites for their clients but now

00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,870
we have designers making careers content

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,090
writers making careers project managers

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,310
sales in other words every aspect of

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,170
business is now part of WordPress

00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,930
whereas historically when we talked

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,630
about somebody if I was to cue this room

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,350
ten years ago

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,120
90% of the room would have been a

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,920
freelancer or somebody that's building

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,200
their own blog or building a blog for a

00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,940
friend something along those levels now

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,730
I hope now there's this roomful of teams

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,090
that build giant products full of people

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,050
that build sites for giant corporations

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,330
things like that

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,550
the evolution of WordPress is not just a

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,230
blog it's still there but we're moving

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,460
further and further into the enterprise

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,570
and we can see that with just some of

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,180
the brains that are using WordPress

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,680
today I apologize this is very us

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,630
centric that tends to be what happens

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,270
especially is it i blatantly stole this

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,790
from my boss Jason Cohen from WP engine

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,560
this particular list but this was a

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,200
couple weeks old just some of the

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,140
various brands from the BBC Viacom

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,890
Microsoft National Geographic all the

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,510
brands using

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,040
and not just as their blogs this is

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,040
being used for all kinds of different

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,450
technologies now and it's not even used

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,580
as their main sites it doesn't need to

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,310
be one of the big advantages of

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,230
WordPress is it's quick to spin up a

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,730
site that for say Microsoft that would

00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,900
normally cost them two to three million

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,430
dollars they might be able to get away

00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,700
with a hundred to two hundred thousand

00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,590
four on WordPress in the enterprise that

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,300
this level of scale is level to quickly

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,760
iterate and get a site then in six weeks

00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,010
for a tenth of the cost is really where

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,650
the strength is it doesn't need to be

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:12,120
the primary CMS and there's a lot of

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,190
growth there if you're out there trying

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,750
to sell people and this has to be your

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,980
only content management system that's

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,310
simply not true anymore

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,200
there's a lot of niche for this 53% of

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:25,770
WP engines respondents as they were

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,150
polled use two or more CMS's I can tell

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,850
you from my own experience this is the

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,070
UF Health website that I just loved we

00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,600
use WordPress as our SEC technically it

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,150
was our secondary content management

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,660
system even even there we had 800 sites

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,640
about and over 30,000 daily users

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,470
including an intranet that had over

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,420
40,000 users on it there's just a matter

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,580
of how many of those logged in a day

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,070
our main this particular this is

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,510
actually Drupal tuple 7 obviously it's a

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,270
needles a little grey design designs

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,500
dated that tends to happen but the rest

00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,380
of our stuff is almost entirely

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,870
WordPress for our front facing sites we

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,290
have two giant WordPress multi-site

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:06,540
installations covering the almost a full

00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:08,550
800 sites and then even on top of that

00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,410
we still have very custom build things

00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,120
we have a directory system that

00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:15,570
integrates with you know all kinds of

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,970
academic sources for the sake of you

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,540
know that's built in PHP of UJS so it's

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:24,750
it's one tool in our toolbox WordPress

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,640
is not the end of the goal it's a tool

00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,770
to help us reach the end of our goal to

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,300
reach our users and that's an important

00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,160
thing to remember is we as we're trying

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,740
to sell new people it doesn't have to be

00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,270
the only thing they're working on and it

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,440
still its greatest weakness or its

00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,150
greatest strength whether you're dealing

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
with enterprise with you're trying to

00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,700
sell a site for a hundred thousand

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,380
that adobe is trying to charge two

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,570
million for you wind up with the

00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,210
integrations that become its single

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,160
greatest strength everything's already

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,200
written the signs of the community the

00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,150
size of the ecosystem around wordpress

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,470
means chances are you don't need to

00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,850
reinvent the wheel as you would with a

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:02,290
proprietary system from 2011 in 2011

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,330
there was proximately a hundred and

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,400
fifty different marketing SAS items and

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,830
this this is this is the mark tech

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,010
evolution mark tech is the blood that

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,530
puts this out every year the 2018

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,210
version of mark tech is up over 7,000

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,190
different sites that integrate their

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,780
different marketing services nearly

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,900
every one of those has an integration

00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,340
with WordPress already available I'll be

00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,220
honest I don't know how us-centric this

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,690
is versus how centric this would be for

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,720
different services in different parts of

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,220
the world but the concept is there if

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,780
you're trying to integrate your customer

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,730
with anything they need WordPress

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,440
probably already has it for you that's

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,880
not changing that's getting stronger

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,790
especially with the ability to build

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,110
blocks different types of services

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,570
especially stuff that is displaying

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,220
content content retrieval it's much

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,020
easier with blocks and it was trying to

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,270
pull things store in the database build

00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,190
all this custom stuff to support it and

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,080
then wait for caching or something else

00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,080
to break this is gonna be easier in your

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,490
hosting this is gonna be easier on

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,900
pretty much all aspects of WordPress in

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,549
order to make sure that things are still

00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,410
moving and your customers getting

00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:08,230
exactly what they need they're kind of

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:11,530
zoom in on this this is the 7,000 from

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,870
2018 I can't read any of them

00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,700
individually they're they're just so

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,890
stuffed in there at this point but the

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,059
idea still comes across there's just so

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,980
much out there that we can integrate

00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,750
with it at this point something that

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,240
makes the question is building a theme

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,650
still redundant if you're still doing

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,090
this deal where you're just building a

00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,950
theme if you're just building that blog

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,320
should we rely on the work yes should we

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,750
move on to new technology keep it is

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,730
what we've learned over 10 years still

00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,770
do we do we have to move on to the new

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,169
stuff no we don't have to move on to new

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,210
things so don't let this stuff scare you

00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:46,210
this is a lot of new and if you're used

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,909
to doing things a different way that's

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,380
fine you can still keep going the web

00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:51,230
interfaces aren't going anywhere

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,010
we're just

00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:57,920
using HTTP there's still RSS feeds you

00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:01,190
can still build emails you can still do

00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,380
a classic editor now we just have new

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,000
ways to develop for this you can

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,250
interface with WordPress from the API

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,830
level API is application programming

00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,090
interface so instead of what I use are

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,490
supposed to see this is what another

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,110
computer is supposed to be you can get

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,970
data out of it from computer to computer

00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,980
instead of just sending it to a person

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,930
you can interface from it from the

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,340
command line which is on your Mac or

00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,080
your window as you go to the terminal

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,780
you can start typing things and you can

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,190
pull up WordPress that way these are

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,720
gonna be strengths these are different

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,850
ways instead of just having one or two

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,570
ways we're not just building web pages

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,760
anymore

00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:37,190
we're building all kinds of integrations

00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,140
meant for cont being consumed by all

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,540
kinds of users most of which aren't even

00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,630
human at this point or can be consumed

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:47,180
by another computer another service we

00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,160
can make sense services progressive web

00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,360
apps all these new technologies are

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,620
available but not required

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,030
what does this mean for WordPress work

00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,450
so what does this really mean for our

00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:01,850
jobs it's just simply new opportunities

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:04,160
if you're a developer learn an interface

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,560
if you're working with the front end if

00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,530
you're building HTML layouts templates

00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,210
great you might need to add react to it

00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:13,940
to make to get the most power out of it

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,740
in order to make the sale but you don't

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,600
have to learn on entire new skill set

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,790
you just add you're adding some to your

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,440
existing skill sets there's other

00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,450
opportunities and themes and beyond I

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,480
don't actually write PHP code anymore I

00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,670
work in WordPress I'm ready than go Lane

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,830
golang is at Google see base language

00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:35,210
yes I see I'm not the only one in the

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:36,620
room it's a sea based language developed

00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,600
by Google about ten years ago that's

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,180
built for command-line tools built for

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,340
desktop tools really I don't write any

00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,550
PHP in my day job anymore and I still

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,320
work in Word for us it's a new

00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,240
opportunity for me and frankly after 10

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,920
years of writing PHP plugins than that I

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,510
could get a little burned out it's been

00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,250
nice to be able to switch and still be

00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,920
in WordPress still be in the community I

00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,300
know and do other things of course for

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,030
designers are probably in the best shape

00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,090
with this layouts of all these different

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,179
integrations and everything

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:08,249
the sky's the limit there and then

00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,289
non-sex even if you're doing something

00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:11,940
you know if you're a writer do the

00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,649
ability to make content easier just

00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,909
means it's more contents going to be

00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:16,860
available it's gonna be easier to get

00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:18,779
that content in there's more opportunity

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,480
to use your skill sets whether it's some

00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,129
content project management or just about

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,909
anything else the opportunities are

00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:28,919
there you're selling into bigger clients

00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:31,019
we're including more people we're

00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,240
sprinting out into new areas the

00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,399
opportunity is there for all of us it's

00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,379
not just the developers world anymore

00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:40,139
it's not just the site admins world

00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:42,240
that's just one part of it everything

00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:43,799
else is gonna go from there so if you're

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,269
willing to scratch someone else's itch

00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,399
in other words if you have a problem you

00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:49,320
need to solve if you see a problem out

00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:51,899
there the opportunity especially right

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,059
now as things are going is is really

00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:56,639
there I would say go big or go home with

00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:59,490
it just take up that opportunity move

00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:01,139
forward with it there's no there's very

00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,789
little plugins out there right now using

00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,879
building blocks so if you want to learn

00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:07,769
blocks start putting your code out there

00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:10,259
better WP security was a plug-in I built

00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:12,509
that's now I theme security I sold it to

00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:14,490
I themes it'll be from five years ago

00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:16,649
next week I think it was one of the

00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,869
first big plug-in sales I was a student

00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:21,269
at the University just trying to learn

00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:23,129
code don't ever look in the code of that

00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:25,919
plug-in if you want some of the old

00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:27,269
stuff is a little odd but it was one of

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,129
those I had a need where I was working

00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:30,509
to build something so I took it and ran

00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:32,759
with it with a plug-in and it's built an

00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:35,309
entire career leading to my goal in work

00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,749
today there's all kinds of this stuff

00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:38,610
especially right now probably right now

00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:40,409
more so in the last 10 years with with

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,330
Gutenberg with these new integrations to

00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:44,119
take something to take a new idea and

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:49,139
run with it whether it be accessibility

00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:51,330
privacy development design it's all

00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:53,159
right there right now so then your next

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,379
step then is just simply get involved

00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,100
with it I give this talk a lot about

00:29:55,379 --> 00:30:00,419
community and there is a look at art

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,220
can't pronounce names this morning short

00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,559
was saying there's the community

00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,929
workshop next this is just kind of a

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,549
quick overview I would say that if if

00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:09,779
you are interested in you really move

00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:12,480
forward you've already taken the next

00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:14,429
step just by sitting in this room the

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,530
fact that you're here means you're

00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:16,880
trying to learn Gutenberg

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,520
you're trying to learn WordPress so

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,990
there's the next step I would suggest

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,450
today they'll get out and enjoy the

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:25,850
Holloway Trek the Holloway tract is

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,440
simply making new if there is a slot

00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,050
with you're not necessarily interested

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,330
in the topic take it take that

00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,980
opportunity to the network here I live

00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,770
in Florida currently because the board

00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,080
camp Miami and the hallway track I work

00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,120
at WP engine quite honestly because of

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,030
the Holloway track at various work camps

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,230
I have gone through this is my fifth

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,450
WordPress company

00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,400
I've never applied for any of the jobs

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,580
I've had it's all been networking

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,230
proving through various items or through

00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,420
various conferences so take that

00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,240
opportunity especially with ideas in

00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,980
Guttenberg if you're a designer maybe to

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,180
team up with the developer this is the

00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,070
type of place where you're gonna find

00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,650
them work and the help to move forward

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:10,850
with this stuff and take it beyond the

00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:12,800
conference your local meetup i assuming

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,150
I couldn't find a Utrecht WordPress

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,650
meetup on Meetup

00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:19,250
that might be because it insists on

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,420
searching Florida for me it's out there

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,780
these meetups are out there from

00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,820

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,810
these skills to the next level

00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,330
to get involved in your local community

00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,920
the Austin WordPress meetup is the one

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:46,070

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,390
first so yeah some of you I think he's

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,860

Mendel from GoDaddy but he was he was

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,950
one of the guys that kind of helped pull

00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,860
me into the Austin WordPress meetup back

00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,600
in the day you can even have to go to a

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,580

if you want to get involved that's the

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,620
place to do it and do it your way

00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,420
find your passion

00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,830
don't let somebody tell you that if you

00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,510
don't know react you can't make it an

00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,830
WordPress if you don't know Gutenberg

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,809
you can't make it and work for us

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:39,410
if you don't know whatever it might be

00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:43,640
the list goes on developer is one role

00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:45,770
in this ecosystem it's one role there's

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,720
all kinds of roles and there's only

00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,220
becoming more and more every day the

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,520
amount of jobs I see every day from

00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,500
support people to project managers to

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,900
content especially content writing jobs

00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,300
I've seen so many more of lately the

00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,280
opportunities are out there don't let

00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,660
somebody tell you you can't do it don't

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,309
let somebody tell you Gutenberg's gonna

00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,130
stop you from doing it this is not the

00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:08,630
end of WordPress this is a new beginning

00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,660
this is where WordPress is going and

00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,950
it's going to be new opportunities

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,390
without the loss of the old

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,330
opportunities so if you're still working

00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:19,340
in PHP still a lot of opportunity for it

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:22,130
there's just more things you can learn

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,690
now so thank you all for coming out this

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,220
morning I hope that gives you a little

00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,140
bit of an idea where WordPress is going

00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,790
where Gutenberg's going ok my name is

00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,410

github thank you very much is there any

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:43,880

a couple minutes either it's too early

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,890
