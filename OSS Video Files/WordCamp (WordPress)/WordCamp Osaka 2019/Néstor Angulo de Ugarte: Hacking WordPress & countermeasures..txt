Title: Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: Hacking WordPress & countermeasures.
Publication date: 2020-02-20
Playlist: WordCamp Osaka 2019
Description: 
	The most 3 typical questions that people ask to me when they realize that I work in the cybersecurity field are:
– How to know if I’ve been hacked
– What to do when this (s**t) happens
– How I can avoid it.
By displaying a little horror gallery with some examples gathered during the years I’ve been working at Sucuri, I will show how a hacked site looks like, helping hopefully to train a little bit your eyes to know where to look at, and some tips to help to detect anomalies ASAP.
Once something bad is detected, there is a recommended checklist of countermeasures to fight against them and avoid future re-infections.

[Applause]

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,309
[Applause]

00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:41,410
sorry that going to be the only Japanese

00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:44,589
I know how I did it good okay so thank

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:47,979
you first of all to the organization to

00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:50,650
bring me this opportunity to be here to

00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:55,330
tell you about cybersecurity about

00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:58,839
hacking and so I brought you know to be

00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:02,019
here and I've been here a couple of

00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:06,580
months and I loved your country really I

00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:09,340
I will return for sure so let's try

00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,920
let's try to talk about hacking wars and

00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:17,320
I say trying because it's kindda

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:21,689
technical so I don't want to overflow

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,490
you okay so first of all konnichiwa

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:29,259
talking about me a little bit more I'm a

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:31,750
computer science engineer but the

00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:33,369
important part is that I am a very very

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,960
curious person right

00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:41,259
I started in sukui in 2015 and I work at

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,429
in incidence response is you know the

00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:47,499
department which our response of when

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:51,039
something bad happens and you have to

00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:58,659
clean you have to restore all the things

00:01:51,039 --> 00:02:01,270
and to the original status and in 2019

00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:04,509
this year I have participated as interim

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,389
head of IT already in the Spanish branch

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,759
because they needed to migrate some

00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:15,060
infrastructure so they needed someone to

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:18,310
lead that I helped with them with that

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:23,349
another question that people ask me is

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,849
very scary talk so here it is ok so some

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:27,069
a group of al

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:30,790
in the middle of a landing Gaussian I

00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,620
born and raised here and some people

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,950
says that is very pretty similar to

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,079
Okinawa okay so maybe that's a next week

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,370
I will I would try to talk in our so

00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:46,989
let's find out how about Sakura Sakura

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:49,209
is the company I was working in Sakura

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,909
is not bad spelling okay it means

00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:54,310
anaconda in brazilian but you know Sucre

00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,230
works very well because it's very

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,620
similar to security or security or

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,340
security it's about the website website

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,590
security

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,919
okay so later in the presentation we're

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:09,489
gonna try to separate what means cyber

00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:12,579
security and website various web

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:16,900
security about sites activity inside of

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:21,909
of the cyber security but it's a full

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:23,769
remote company we are more more than 25

00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:28,349
countries around the world and in

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:30,909
starting in 2008 and in 2017 it was

00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:34,919
acquired by GoDaddy and now we are part

00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:38,739
of garadi as secure and also as gourry

00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,079
security team I recommend to you to

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,900
check this this is scanners side check

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:47,199
is very well known around the world

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:54,909
scanner just to check if your web pages

00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:59,440
okay it's a there is not very very

00:03:54,909 --> 00:04:01,510
visible thread in it on it and there's a

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,859
performance one so you can check how

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:07,959
your website perform against our nodes

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:12,280
and run the world so you can just take

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:16,090
an idea of how your site performs to any

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:22,210
people or to review in the world so this

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:24,909
is my mind map when I started to think

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,909
about this presentation I gonna take you

00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:31,000
through these concepts these topics I

00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:34,389
will start just talking setting ups some

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,409
concepts this is not going to be very

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,319
boring I promise this

00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:43,469
kiwannis you know the art of war so how

00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,759
we can hijack wordpress and also

00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:49,860
understand how to defend it

00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,039
the third section gonna be some content

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:58,860
measures to avoid this risk as majestic

00:04:53,039 --> 00:05:02,429
as we can so let's start first with

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,939
concepts one of the things I always say

00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:09,089
in my presentations is I gonna work with

00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,339
sensitive data so I prefer to say any

00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,229
substantive data gonna be protected or

00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,969
entreated in this presentation to

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:19,289
preserve privacy so anything that you

00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:20,279
see which could be similar to reality is

00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:23,369
just a coincidence

00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:26,189
everything I say is what I'd responsible

00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:28,319
for for know what you interpret so if

00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:32,519
you have any depth you have any question

00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,819
as always to an expert this is another

00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:39,209
slide is always present in my

00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:42,269
representation this is pretty much how

00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:45,629
we feel in the cybersecurity world this

00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:48,149
this guy yawn chamber is the CEO of

00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:52,740
Cisco Cisco is a very big company and

00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:55,829
about network infrastructure around the

00:05:52,740 --> 00:06:00,179
world and he says there are two kind of

00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:02,069
company right once those that have been

00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:08,779
hacked and those that doesn't know that

00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:12,769
has been hard so when we did say hack

00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:15,479
what we what we means something is

00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:20,009
website has been attacked by a hacker

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:23,339
but what is really a hacker I always say

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:26,579
so try to educate people to not misuse

00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:29,999
the term hacker because hacker means a

00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:32,459
curious person who goes beyond something

00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:35,159
beyond say commercializing competitor

00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:39,689
commissioner's nothing amazing right

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:41,759
sorry we are limits find other uses for

00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:44,809
things that are not intended for that

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,430
right for example if you are feeling

00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:50,039
yourself a little bit sleepy and you

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,420
drink coffee you are biohacking yourself

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,750
if you are

00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,580
we use a bottleneck just to get

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,120
organized you're not kids

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:04,830
you are hacking the the bottleneck right

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,280
so hacker is just use you know well all

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,690
the things but if we are talking about

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,140
cybersecurity we're talking about

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:18,030
computer hackers and in this

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:22,250
presentation I just percenters my cyber

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,960
Turtles pet to say hi there

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,330
he's gonna represent in this

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:33,360
presentation the hacker right a bad guy

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:36,420
did you know the Kraken is another name

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,300
we know you using this in this world a

00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,040
computer hacker saboteurs is a computer

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,950
hacker that is always aligned and to

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,450
enrich himself normally against others

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:51,150
right so to distinguish more or less

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:55,710
what a hacker is because at the end if I

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:58,470
am very curious person I feel myself as

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,940
a hacker so to distinguish a little bit

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:05,100
how hackers behave in this world we

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,650
normally separate in hot colors okay so

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,370
blackhat hackers and normally the cyber

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,010
terrorists

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,400
the thieves and why hackers what had

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,550
hacked the security analyst ethical

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,770
hackers or also members of the blue team

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,160
is also known as the type like that

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:26,250
right there is a gray area in in the

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:31,220
middle those who normally has good

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:35,070
intentions but do things in a legal way

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:37,680
is we call normally grey hat hackers

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,850
okay so like for example John Snowden if

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,920
you remember some years ago he he

00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,320
released some papers very interesting

00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,390
people pay purse to the world with a

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,430
good intention but obviously illegally

00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,770
well what hackers do normally they

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,230
create malware or they inject malware in

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,740
the web sites and malware is just so

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:05,389
we're interested designed to to cause

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:09,739
damage to computers to cry

00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:12,860
person's to networks so whatever and

00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:15,619
malware has a lot of names probably some

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:20,269
of them sounds to you you know backdoors

00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:24,350
try and horses ransomware but I'm not

00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:29,149
going to get the in deep into this as I

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,869
told you cybersecurity is a huge field

00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,540
of study

00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:36,410
okay so web security is just one of the

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,369
fields inside all cyber security so in

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,319
the real world

00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,989
normally with all of the people Asin

00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:47,049
that are here has at least two

00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:49,999
identities right the real one as persons

00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:52,670
and the digital one normally conforms

00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:55,759
with a lot of nicknames accounts on so

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,470
on around the internet so if you care

00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,600
about security in the real world why not

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:03,350
you care about security in your digital

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,989
war so cyber security is the security in

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,769
the digital world and where security is

00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:12,799
yes a field especially all that happens

00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:18,319
through the port 80 or 443 if you are a

00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:21,110
little bit technical savvy right then

00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:24,160
this slide is intended to blow your mind

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,919
a little bit okay so there are six

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,379
interesting facts here the first one say

00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,139
hacking is almost never clearing

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:37,819
client-oriented I mean doesn't money you

00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:42,439
have a side with store for Kittanning or

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:44,389
to rise funds for something social

00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:47,269
something like that they don't - they

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:49,759
are just crawling Internet and finding

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:52,610
some vulnerabilities and yes if you have

00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:56,299
that they don't mind what are you doing

00:10:52,610 --> 00:11:00,439
they just get your site so normally it

00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:02,720
happens because you or your company or

00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:05,589
the company the hosting company or the

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,629
administrator you have hire for that

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:10,759
it's not making a good monitoring or

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:13,699
maintenance of the side normally okay so

00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,360
that's the most typical reason another

00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:18,860
another interesting fact here is that

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,910
the people doesn't understand what I

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh certificate is so let me just explain

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,460
that a certificate is not an anti

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,770
hacking shield I mean having an SSL

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,710
certificate is not going to protect you

00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:36,380
to be hack SSL certificate is only

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,740
intended to assure the communication

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,450
from your device to the server so if

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:47,090
there is a hacker hacking your server

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:48,500
you're gonna hack securely no another

00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,890
fact that's interesting

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,770
normally in security we are behind

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,710
huggers okay so patches on security

00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:02,090
updates appears almost always after

00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:05,810
hacking exploits which translate means

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:08,930
if there is an update or a patch of

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,510
security means that there are some

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,920
hackers around the world with

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:20,360
information to hack your site because

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:24,350
it's updated okay the next one is Latin

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,500
q quote I always use is something just

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,750
to give some perspective it means human

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,760
being fails in Latin sounds something

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,730
like err are you ready

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,250
am i oh man you missed okay so human

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:42,820
being fails it means everything you do

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:47,690
we do as humans could fail and in turn

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:51,950
based on that security will never be

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:54,140
100% effective so if you still a lot of

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,890
plugins if you have a firewall if you

00:12:54,140 --> 00:13:02,240
have SSL if you have any of the security

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:05,630
things in your side it won't show a 100%

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,350
effective and effectiveness of security

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:13,510
right it could be 90 or something like

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:21,980
that but is there is always powers right

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:24,350
this is a graph just got from some

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,890
reports we have in is a GUI you can

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,150
visit insecure or net website you have

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,950
block side and also you have some

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:37,380
reports this one is very interesting

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:39,990
as you can see the wordpress is clearly

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:46,230
the more target and the more most

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:47,970
targeted platform internet so it is not

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,490
and this is not meaning that the

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:53,399
wordpress is insecure okay that means

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,639
that is the most targeted it is because

00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,730
also the 34% of the world of the

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,940
worldwide web site and run the world an

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:09,779
Internet is made by WordPress it's

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:12,839
something like one of every three so but

00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:18,029
this interesting the hackers are focus

00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:21,240
especially in WordPress so now let's go

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:25,199
forward to their art of world joy we

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,220
have to put ourself in the hackers skin

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:32,070
we'll have to try to think as a hacker

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:35,010
as a black hat hacker okay and try to

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,870
understand why they what they want from

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,720
our platform what they want from our

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:43,079
website okay so let's get in the into

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,110
the mind of your enemy first of all what

00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,779
the hack what black hat hacker wants

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,839
from my website the common targets are

00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:55,310
normally users information so you have

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,540
users in your site customers you have

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:03,620
subscribers or something like that and

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:07,589
they are probably an email address name

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,829
nicknames and so those are information

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:13,170
that hackers values a lot okay so user

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,779
info is important also the database

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:19,380
information everything you put some you

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:23,250
put in the in your website normally is

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:25,199
in the database as well website content

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:29,930
if you are selling products like for

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:32,010
example playing so you are selling no

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,839
photographs or something like that

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:38,910
normally you have them in your media

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,550
manager in the WordPress and so on so it

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,030
isn't they were in the in your web site

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,200
so maybe hackers are interesting on that

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:51,320
as well the infrastructure is important

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:55,280
as well normally people doesn't

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,350
understand this part because it's a

00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,920
little bit technical but there is people

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:06,170
that use your website as a platform for

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:09,620
example to grab a cryptocurrency mining

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:12,620
for example okay so or they can use your

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,540
website but not Wayside your server your

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,330
server resources for example to attack

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,260
another one okay so infrastructure is

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:24,110
also important they may need your

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,260
website to use it in a botnet as well or

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:31,520
they need your reputation so if you work

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:34,040
hard during a lot of time to rise your

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,650
protection in India neti and social

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,050
networks or in the certain Giants

00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,660
because you need to be in the first

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,830
position something like that it's a real

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:49,430
real risk if you get hacked that you can

00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:51,380
see how your reputation or your hard

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,910
work to be in the first position the

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:57,290
certain gene something like that just

00:16:52,910 --> 00:17:00,580
vanish in the air so taking care about

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:03,740
the reputation is important as well

00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,960
so there is a quote in the art of war

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,540
saying something like know yourself and

00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,120
know your enemy and you will win all the

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:14,660
battles right so let's know our

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,090
weaknesses there is a lot of course but

00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,970
these are the most important the first

00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:23,720
one is the most important in fact you

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,150
are we are as users the weakest point

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,200
always okay so you can stand you can be

00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:33,170
stung you can use bad passwords you can

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:39,050
is easy to hack passwords or you can

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:41,150
just no because just all premium plugins

00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,680
just because you can't you want to save

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,120
some money and the premium flying has

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,400
inside the triangle there's a half

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,460
inside something the hack your side so

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,290
at the end we are the weakest point as

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,600
well as I mentioned are vulnerable to

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,210
brute-force attacks for example DC match

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,260
is very typical

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:05,500
don't use easy passwords just invest a

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:10,840
little bit of time trying to remember

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:14,350
good strong passwords or use a second

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:19,180
factor authentication method is another

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:22,120
way of making this stronger there are

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,180
some left lips leftovers I mean for

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,730
example you are making a new version of

00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:31,990
the website and if you want to make

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,970
easier to your to the owner of the

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,370
website to get into their website and

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,180
check how it's how it is going you

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:41,200
normally gonna create a very easy to

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,120
remember

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,350
login something like adding one two

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,190
three or something like that

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,740
so when we do that we have to be very

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,500
careful we had to manage to control

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,440
these kind of things because the

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,350
leftovers are other of the main reasons

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,100
or the main factors or main vector of

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:05,590
infections in the web sites so I can

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:10,440
hack your site for example just getting

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:14,890
into the - new website website and then

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,830
just exploit your password because it

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,770
was very easy or something like that so

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:23,650
if you create these kind of things

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:28,990
remember to remove if they are not used

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:35,830
okay the other big reason is I'll delete

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:39,220
or una Rosa where so maybe if you are

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:42,730
not very technical you don't understand

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:48,160
that your website is just a lay layer of

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:51,640
the the whole system so you can be in a

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,310
hosting a very cheap hosting or

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,970
something like that where the PHP

00:19:54,310 --> 00:20:00,460
version for example is very old or the

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:05,200
Apache Apache version is also very old

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:07,960
nginx or something like that so having

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,030
your website in in a outdated

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,650
environment is very dangerous as well

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,660
and being

00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,700
inside of your site if you have planning

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,270
so you have themes and you an update

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:23,170
them you are putting your site in risk

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:25,720
also as I said there even if they are

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,540
disabled so if you are not using a

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,470
plugin remove them if you are not using

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:36,280
a theme remove it ok don't disable or

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:41,770
don't just keep there and if you won't

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:43,570
do that please update anyway so the last

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:47,140
one is very obvious just secure

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:49,030
connection avoid public Wi-Fi so you can

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,750
be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:56,020
hackers like hackers people that are in

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:59,800
public spaces just looking what the

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:03,730
people are just transmitting through

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,800
that network you know how many

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,080
formations you can gather in and just in

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,940
an hour in a place like a university or

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,090
like a coffee a Starbucks coffee or

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,980
something like that ok so let's go into

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,100
the hacking WordPress the process so

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:22,090
this is a very short slide but let me

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:25,120
explain a little bit first of all try to

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,430
imagine your website as a castle and try

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,720
to imagine your security as a wall

00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:34,300
around the castle ok so a hacker can

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,250
hack your side if there is a hole in

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:42,670
your wall so that hole is what we call

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:45,790
vulnerability and hackers when they find

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,760
a hole they click create exploit which

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:52,150
is a server that leverage that

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,850
vulnerability and once they get access

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,040
to your site they inject something they

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,770
can inject yes only final code for

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:06,750
example span things spanning the

00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:12,330
comments span in jail in your folders

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:15,730
doing your directory tree directory a

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,400
backdoor just to get access to into the

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:21,970
web site later even if you have plugged

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,120
that vulnerability and using a backer

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,870
you can later inject whatever you want

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,800
this

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,750
use their websites but as a pod node or

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,350
inject more final code whatever you want

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:39,770
so all what the hacker needs is a hole

00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:44,590
in your world that hole can happen in

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:47,740
any moment there is a lot of networks of

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:51,410
bloggers around the world just

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:54,020
communicating between them and if any of

00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:58,940
them just find a hole they gonna explore

00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:01,520
that in massively so they're gonna find

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:08,120
for example if they now we are in the

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:11,120
version of WordPress 5.3 I think I think

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,400
this is a five point two or three or

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,050
something like that put point five point

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,090
two point three or something like that

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:21,440
there is a Panera teen in the core so

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:25,340
they can use it to hack so people

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,380
hackers are hackers are just crawling

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,890
Internet to get all the words in

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:33,470
WordPress not updated just to use that

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,780
hole with exploits so as I said

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:39,800
barometers yes a bug in the code or a

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:43,760
possibility of misuse leggy code that

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:46,370
can be explode exploited to perform as a

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,950
NASA recent actions within a computer

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,860
system exploit is just the so where to

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:54,230
leverage that banality and the back door

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,470
is just malware injecting your site that

00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,470
tank that allows remote execution of

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,770
code even if you have black double

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:09,740
reality okay so when you get a backdoor

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:12,110
in your side you are boost okay this is

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,590
a very interesting website if you are

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,750
curious about is the VPS can burn every

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:22,600
database I think is sponsored by

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:25,850
automatic and this is list of known

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,310
vulnerabilities so you can check from

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:34,210
time to time to check if the plans you

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:36,450
have the version plans are vulnerable or

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,970
do something

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:44,910
the world wave of attacks specifically

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:48,090
focusing in a version or a specific

00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:50,370
version that you can see here okay so BP

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,670
will never leave the database calm is

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:57,480
very interesting you are Korean enough

00:24:52,670 --> 00:25:00,360
so let me just show some examples I

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,380
selected for you there are a lot I have

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,070
to

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,050
I had to select just three of them the

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,270
first one is the defacement I probably

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:13,080
the most visual the most spectacular one

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:16,620
so could you imagine if my website is

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:20,850
this one and tomorrow when I wake up in

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:24,150
the morning I see this so I have been

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:27,090
defaced okay and this is a real example

00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:30,420
for example for in this case a

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:35,390
photograph or gallery this is an extract

00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:39,690
of the website okay look like this and

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:41,760
one day just look like this so could you

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,910
imagine the stress of the of the

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,420
customer something like oh I could be I

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:51,630
mean my reputation gonna be gonna low so

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:54,150
it's important okay what happened here

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,910
if you are curious enough is that the

00:25:54,150 --> 00:26:00,060
hacker just got into the a web site took

00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:03,720
a picture of the web site and then just

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:10,050
code this fancy message in the top of it

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:12,270
rename it as an index dot HTML and since

00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:16,380
the majority of the web servers run the

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:20,220
world lot first the HTML for files

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:24,060
instead of PHP ones this one was they

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:27,330
the the first page when the people try

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,780
to load the domain just removing it then

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:34,430
removing the index dot to the mail was

00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:37,640
enough to fix this issue or maybe

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:41,370
reinstalling the WordPress core folders

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:45,800
that works in a lot of cases that works

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:48,900
so another case for example a pet store

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,280
the day after you can find these this is

00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:55,260
as you can see this

00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:57,790
massage a political message right is

00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:01,780
about free severe people and so on

00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:04,390
declaring war so on right as a bonus I

00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,760
can just show another one I loved the

00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:09,040
design of this one I really don't

00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,710
understand what it says but it's

00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,190
probably about security thing around the

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,300
world something probably about Turkish

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,360
people or something like that

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,730
okay so just summarizing the files meant

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,270
it's a partial or full replacement of

00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:28,930
the website front end barrier abuse easy

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,850
for to detect users can they take it

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:33,070
easily than you because you are not

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:38,290
visiting your website every day so here

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:40,480
then provide to them of enough channels

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:45,580
to communicate to you so they will help

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:48,220
you vary a lot it's a special it's

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,170
important that when you can get hack the

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,880
most important factor is the time so the

00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:58,300
sooner you get that you having hack and

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,620
you fix that will help to the lose of

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:05,380
reputation will help a lot okay scanners

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:08,050
also detect this very easily at the end

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:12,240
is yes a matter of awareness social

00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:17,080
political measures for indications or

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,340
you know clayman's another example is

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,890
the black hat seal

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:27,640
no spam I mention it before for example

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:33,280
here we have a design agency I guess a

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:35,080
cover name of the of the agency but for

00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,910
sure the banner is not intended to be

00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:42,100
there so probably they don't sell viagra

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:44,590
probably not that probably so

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:47,770
what the hackers did is just put that

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,870
banner in your web site so everyone that

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:54,160
comes into your web site and try to

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:58,020
contact you say see that you sell by VR

00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:01,020
right or for example this is a cleaning

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,020
company

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:09,419
who got the hither also full of span is

00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:15,179
in this case is just text something like

00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:18,150
selling applications in Google store or

00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:21,150
something like that but it's clearly a

00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:24,870
spam right so the result of these if you

00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:29,520
are if you are if you don't get it soon

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:32,790
is this you get banned by Google or by

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,910
other blog listing vendors and then you

00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:39,390
can get your the this fancy attack in

00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:41,280
the individual search results your in

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,440
this side may be hacked so your

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:48,059
reputation will be affected for sure

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:51,809
okay here is another example at the left

00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:56,340
you can see that you can try to find a

00:29:51,809 --> 00:30:00,200
website in Google there is this kind of

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:02,850
message like cheap night shoes or

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,980
something like that right and in the

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:09,919
right you can see a spam injected early

00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:13,260
in the in the directories tree those

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:16,679
have been highlighted our spam the

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:25,010
inside of them they have just a lot of

00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:31,890
HTML and web page with spam terms right

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:34,260
what is intended here is is to target

00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:37,309
your CEO or your reputation maybe your

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:40,190
competitor just hire these hackers and

00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:44,370
try to lower your reputation because

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:46,620
they want just to surprise you you in

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,950
the in Google or something like that we

00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:53,640
want just to not to make you not selling

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:55,350
so much as they the detection of this is

00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,179
very easy as well because the terminal

00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:02,070
spam terms are always more or less the

00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:05,760
same ones so as I always says here your

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,169
users right T videos attacks or botnets

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,280
this is a little bit difficult to

00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:12,730
understand let me just introduce some

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:17,150
[Music]

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:20,179
some definitions do s attack is a denial

00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:22,789
of service which means it's over harmed

00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:26,570
the application with a huge amount of

00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:30,350
petitions if you have a person who just

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:32,870
get tickets and you put five hundred of

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:36,049
people giving tickets to that guy the

00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:40,100
probably the guy gonna collapse okay so

00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:43,789
a DD always happens when it is additive

00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:47,179
distributed and distributed attack so

00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:49,490
it's not only a lot of petition from one

00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:56,059
point to another point is a lot of point

00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:57,980
asking for service to a website and this

00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:02,020
normally happens because there is a

00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:05,690
botnet there is a net of computers or

00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:09,590
net of websites the husband that have

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:13,940
been hug and they coordinated attack or

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:17,140
ask for information to a website okay so

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:21,409
this is a graphic but you can just check

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:25,130
later if you want so there's this site

00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:28,190
North it's a real-time map of the DDoS

00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:31,400
attack around the world so here you can

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:34,880
see a normal situation just maybe

00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:39,289
tending to to be very calm normally it's

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:43,370
a little bit more busy but in 2016 if

00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:45,320
you remember all the services the common

00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:49,820
social network services like for example

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:53,030
Netflix Twitter was up and so on some

00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:57,860
others just fell down and it was it

00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:59,780
happened because of this a lot of of

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,990
nodes around the world hack a

00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:06,890
specifically one server which which is

00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:09,260
called a team that has been is used by

00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:12,860
these services around the world they

00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:16,340
that that year were also happen also

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:21,679
another very famous attack but they was

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:23,899
performed by CCTVs okay so DDoS attack

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,920
looks like something like this this is a

00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:35,420
graphical

00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:39,320
datian of a DDoS attack so it's good

00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:42,530
ideas clear right well effect to

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:46,880
infrastructure it's very difficult to to

00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:49,370
point this kind of of attacks normally

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,860
because you detect a strain use of

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:56,510
resources or you have a fire and rickety

00:33:51,860 --> 00:34:00,050
scanner you have someone dedicated to to

00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:04,280
check that so the here is recommended to

00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:06,980
have a wolf why web application firewall

00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,800
okay target normally are just service

00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:14,810
resources or just to make your site as a

00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:16,730
zombie note so we reach the third part

00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:20,780
of my presentation this is a very quick

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:24,740
one what is what countermeasures are

00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:28,280
recommended okay first of all let's talk

00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:30,110
that if something bad happens which are

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,860
the character in this story right first

00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:38,690
you you your site admin and the owner

00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:41,150
has been has to be notified okay but

00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:45,980
also your user certain clients if there

00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:48,830
is for example credit card leak of a

00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,740
credit card information leak or if there

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:54,470
is something any information that may

00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:56,360
affect to them for to the users

00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:59,030
information you have in your website or

00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:04,820
in your platform they you have to you

00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:07,910
have you and you have to inform them you

00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:10,160
have to notify them okay so the second

00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:13,450
that a curtain this story is a hosting

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,140
provider normally a hosting provider and

00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:21,440
normal one should give support when you

00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:25,490
your site is husband hug just because

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,230
they restore call folders or because

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:31,400
they restore a backup or something like

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:35,090
that normally 70% of the security uses

00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,270
issues can be fixed by the support of

00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:40,520
the hosting provider and after that

00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,660
you can just try to check with our

00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:47,330
security expert externally or internally

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,890
like securio any other companies it's

00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,140
important to understand and Security's

00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:54,740
nothing is nothing like a hole right

00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:58,970
it's a it's just a lot of liars

00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:01,550
one in top of the other so the first

00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,950
layer of security as I mentioned before

00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:07,550
is you because you are the weakest liar

00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:10,040
so you have to be educated of what you

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,890
click where you click what is the

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:18,320
information they the people need and how

00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:23,260
and when the second one is your device

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,730
if you are using a laptop or phone

00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,670
something like that has been hard all

00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:31,310
these virus inside something like that

00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,890
it's another layer you have to protect

00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:35,900
with an anti-virus your connection as I

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:40,190
mentioned before as I saw your website

00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:43,460
should be behind a warp website

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,560
Application Firewall you have to take

00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:49,840
care of your credential not only yours

00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:55,370
but only the green shows do you give to

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:57,950
your mates or your clients try to use

00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:03,860
the second factor authentication if

00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:08,030
possible the site security so you should

00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:10,820
monitor and update your website as much

00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:13,730
as you can the server security the

00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,160
database and of course it's not only

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:19,370
just put an eye on them you have to

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,970
maintain this you have to do all the

00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:31,280
whole boob in this security layers in

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:34,040
base system as much as you can ok so

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,440
there are some measures normally I

00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,560
divide them in reactive and proactive

00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,380
reactive means that something happened

00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,350
already happened so what we are going to

00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,830
do is just pain mitigation and practice

00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:51,320
means all the measures that you take

00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,970
before anything bad happens so it's a

00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,870
risk

00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:59,140
right reacting measures mentioned some

00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:00,490
of them for example scan your site first

00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,950
to know what happened

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,650
reactive means that already happened

00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,390
something bad so it's come first your

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,850
website I recommend side-chick but there

00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:11,740
are some others like for example how do

00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,700
I know if my website have been

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,370
blacklisted

00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:18,670
so by rows total dot-com is a website

00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:21,490
for that then the CRC check remove

00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:25,390
unchanged which means for example in

00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:29,820
this case this is a wordpress users

00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:35,590
table right so here's there are the

00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:38,050
users of this website i just protected

00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:41,140
those the legged but those that are not

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:43,870
it's very very straightforward right I

00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,500
came in with key and the picture also

00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:49,980
helps a lot we know email is an

00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:53,920
administrator and also has a post who

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:58,530
and there are some others for example

00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:02,700
the manage BP migration is not a fake

00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:06,700
admin is just a left over of a migration

00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:09,970
process so remove them is your site is

00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:15,220
not in migration right now and another

00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:17,500
thing is interesting here is the this

00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,100
website I think yeah I think that you

00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,710
can not see it here but there is has six

00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:26,530
six updates

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:30,910
six updates available right so please

00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:33,360
every time you see you know here in the

00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:38,590
top of the admin bar something like a

00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:41,740
number the dashboard of you know telling

00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:47,170
you how many updates are available click

00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:48,940
there and update okay so check remove

00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,990
and change in this case for example

00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:54,850
check there means users and remove them

00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:58,360
also do that with the plugins I have

00:39:54,850 --> 00:40:02,140
found a lot of website with 60 plugins

00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:04,450
is impossible that you need 60 plans ok

00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,700
even if you are a very very famous

00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,850
magazine you don't

00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:12,780
it's sixty planets so probably you have

00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:14,760
a lot of them in use but some of them

00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,570
are just disabled because you use

00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:22,740
seasonal or because you use any time and

00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:27,270
then is not needed anymore update your

00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:31,830
site because updating Alber right the

00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:34,140
core directories and file so if the

00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:37,860
infection is in the core directories and

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:40,320
files and core files just updating do

00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:45,660
you just remove the and infection right

00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:47,790
and as a last as a last measure restore

00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:52,050
a backup keep in mind that restoring a

00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:54,360
backup could imply a loss of information

00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:57,210
right because maybe you did a backup

00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,730
three days ago and all happens although

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:03,000
what happens in the last three days you

00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:07,050
will lose that okay talking about

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,520
proactive measures before happening but

00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:15,020
something bad happening reduce amines

00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:17,280
planes and things do backups updates

00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:20,490
embedding hosting and security and

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,830
Estela woth it is important this this

00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:25,980
this is right is very important the more

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:28,440
doors you have the higher risk so I

00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:32,730
always say to cancel what the sky source

00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:37,680
means if you are going to do some adding

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:40,290
stuff okay half an admin user but if you

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,650
are going just only to polish user a

00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:45,510
limited count for that try to remove the

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:53,520
number of admins try to contain that

00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:56,610
client themes also don't reuse password

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,280
try to change and change it periodically

00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:02,100
and try to use the second factor

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,410
authentication as I said and this is

00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:07,500
applied to all layers not only in the VP

00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:11,460
I mean if you have FTP accounts if you

00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:14,550
have cPanel if you have a hosting

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,690
provider account change the password

00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,270
from time to time

00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,200
and if you have been hot another thing

00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,109
that you have to do

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,210
changed all the passwords well okay

00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:27,690
backups half of backups at ready

00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:31,589
but never never store the backups in

00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:33,599
your production server always store them

00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:35,130
in a in another server and all

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,880
difference outside okay

00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:41,040
and I clean a functional backup will be

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,660
your preference best friend in a bad day

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:48,869
and I want to highlight functional I

00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:50,490
mean I have phone cases that the people

00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:52,589
say I know I have a backup I will send

00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:58,320
to you and when I receive it it's

00:42:52,589 --> 00:43:00,270
corrupt non unstable so it's not only

00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:04,770
having backups only know that they are

00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:05,490
functional update always this is

00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,640
important

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:12,000
keep in mind that the cost of getting

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,910
your website from a hack situation and

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,200
recover all the information recover with

00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:22,560
in front of your users will be way much

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,859
more cost that recover your website

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,829
because it accidentally shut down

00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:32,099
because I mean compatibility when you

00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:35,130
update or upgrade your website so this

00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:38,910
graphic is important automatic updates

00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:44,150
enabled for our clients are only

00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:47,790
important for the 30% the rest of them

00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,980
are just when is possible when as soon

00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:54,450
as possible when the client wants or

00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:57,900
whatever so our black hot cutter cut

00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:59,730
there is very happy when they find these

00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,950
kind of things it's important to invest

00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:04,349
in security in Herning hosting keep in

00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:10,980
mind that hosting is the first layer is

00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:14,220
the first one that protects your website

00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,230
right I always said if you invest in ash

00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,069
are hosting keep in mind that you can be

00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:23,160
in a very noisy neighborhood okay if you

00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:26,579
want to be in a salad alone just add

00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:32,280
your own it gonna be a little bit more

00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:33,090
expensive how much of your budget invest

00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,800
in you web security

00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:41,720
zero for almost 50% this is important as

00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:46,260
well so freely for our black hat hacker

00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:49,170
and the last one what the Web

00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,870
Application Firewall is your word org

00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:54,540
this is important I'm not going to read

00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:58,380
all of this but keep in mind that woth

00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:02,280
is something like washing tunnel every

00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,320
connection goes through like for example

00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:08,100
you can see here all the connection goes

00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:11,670
through here then is clean all the bad

00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:15,000
connection just are drop and then the

00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:19,410
good ones hit your site so this is very

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,260
interesting this is my one of the quotes

00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,820
I want to share with you everybody needs

00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,970
a hugger

00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,810
so ariados amos if you have any

00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:33,420
questions

00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:33,420
