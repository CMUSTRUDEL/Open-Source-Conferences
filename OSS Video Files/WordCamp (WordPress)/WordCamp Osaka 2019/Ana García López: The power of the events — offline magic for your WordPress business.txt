Publication date: 2020-02-20
Playlist: WordCamp Osaka 2019
Description: 
	Nowadays it seems that every Marketing strategy is focused on the online media. It may seem totally natural, when you run an online WordPress business. However, we should never underestimate the power of the offline connection between people. In the context of WordPress community events like WordCamps are a great opportunity both for personal learning and business growth. Events can help you learn new things and meet like-minded people, but they can also be a very important part of the marketing strategy for your WordPress business. In this talk I will guide you through the best practices of attending, sponsoring and organizing events, which are relevant to your business. I will share examples from my own experience with events and you will learn how they can be incorporated in your marketing strategy.

WordPress community and to me was very

00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:59,299
shocking because you know I come from a

environment it is quite different

because of the feeling of the community

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,030
is different for WordPress there is

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,269
actually a real community with real

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:17,720

type of of events the first one is that

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:18,730
it's a direct window display of your

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:22,030
product so you can you can show how your

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:24,430
product works you can show your features

00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,530
you can explain how they work which are

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,860
the benefits for your for your clients

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:33,370
like current and potential ones you can

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,560
also decide to launch a new product here

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:39,910
on a worker and for example you will get

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,800
a lot of social media noise and you will

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,860
create your brand image as well with

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:51,610
this so it's a perfect place to really

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:54,700
show your product the second part as

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,800
well is them is the good knowledge of

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,960
your competitors so when you go to a

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,850
work camp you will see if you go around

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,350
you will see that there may be some

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,390
positive competitors of yours

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,920
they're also here and showing their

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:13,130
products so you can see which products

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,560
they are emphasizing with features and

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,630
also if they are running a game they are

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,220
trying to get leads as well to do that

00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:25,970
remarketing they are launching a new

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,640
ebook or even they are you know they are

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,080
trying to to get information about how

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:36,050
the status of of the of the market is

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,480
but the good thing about about the event

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,240
is that because you can also do this

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,410
kind of research similar to online is

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,240
that on event you can go and talk to to

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,640
your competitors and that's something

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,960
I've seen especially in WordPress events

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:56,450
not in other events is amplify when I've

00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,180
been to marketing events yes you can go

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,070
and talk to your competitors but it's

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,260
different so it's not so easy because

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,390
people will be like you know what do you

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,190
want to know you want to get some

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,020
information for me that is not something

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm you know like I don't want to

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,410
disclose things like that

00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,420
but here people are very very

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,760
approachable and even your carpet eaters

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,190
you will see that you can hang out with

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,860
them in the after party you can go for a

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,110
coffee with them so they are very

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,330
friendly and it's something that are

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,310
really valuable from war pestilence and

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:35,600
from the community and that's very

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:38,510
different from from other events also

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,130
you can meet your clients like your your

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:44,060
current clients and your potential

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:46,580
clients so yes of course you can also

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:50,000
kind of meet them online you know when

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,430
they they tweet on your account

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,070
they put a comment on your blog you know

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,430
they send you an email but in the end

00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,710
you know like we are people so you it's

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,650
more than just a tweet or just a comment

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,800
on a blog so it's about a real person

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,800
who's got like real needs and real

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,250
problems and you know in this era of

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:16,640
artificial intelligence of tap boats and

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,650
everything so it's a real still value

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:23,330
and I hope we will still value in the

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:27,400
future like the value of a real person

00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:30,200
on how a person can help you and if you

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,170
if you have the chance to be on at an

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,000
event and to talk to your clients that

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,700
will give you a really valuable insight

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,920
that you can apply to your credits you

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,440
can improve your practice with this you

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,900
can say also what what you don't like

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,120
about my product so how can I improve it

00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,460
for you because in the end you want to

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,110
service them you want to help them with

00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,710
their with their businesses as well as

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:57,140
with their objectives so this will give

00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:59,570
you as well a better brand image in

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,870
front of them because when people put

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:06,170
faces real faces to the brand their

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,740
their image of the brand's change and

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,750
improves so they will they even can

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,540
become advocates of your brand and

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:21,410
recommend you which is something that is

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:23,740
very difficult to to get online mmm

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,260
also apart from clients you can meet

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,030
potential partners so imagine that you

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,210
are a designer and you are designing

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:35,060
websites or WordPress websites and you

00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,590
are getting stuck on some on some code

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,200

WordPress community people that are very

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,720

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,570
can be beneficial for your business for

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,400
your personal project and and I really

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,100

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:59,550
so I mean welcome Tokyo I was there with

00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:02,340
with a booth and one person came to me

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,790
saying that he introduced himself and he

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:08,460
talked to me about my company and how he

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:12,480
liked my company and I was really really

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:15,510
and very happy that he wanted to work

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,270
with us because that means that you are

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:21,270
doing something great if if people come

00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:23,130
to you and say hey I wanna be part of

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,710
your project of your mission and of your

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:30,240
vision it means that you are in the

00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:32,520
right way and also you know this this is

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,500
very easy to happen not just in word

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:40,140
press events but in other kind of events

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,670
as well so how to participate all these

00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,490
things can be achieved on different

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:48,660
levels depending on how you take part in

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:51,060
in warpless event the first way of

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,520
taking part is just attending is the

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,570
easiest way and you just need to to know

00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:01,320
when the word come is going to happen

00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:03,450
it's gonna happen and buy the ticket and

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,060
go to the work camp I recommend you that

00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,860
before the work um you do some research

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:12,720
about the people who are going to attend

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:17,100
and also about the speakers because then

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,020
you can go to the work camp and and kind

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,900
of target the people you you want to

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,660
talk about and to to to do business and

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:28,950
to get information and to exchange

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:31,200
information and do networking so but I

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,240
also recommend you that if you can

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,510
create a t-shirt with your with your

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,700
logo and just go around visit the Bulls

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,000
talk to people

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:45,240
especially like sorry do a lot of

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,630
networking not just passively but also

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,020
active actively talk about your project

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:54,450
talk about your your business estates

00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,780
opinions like give as much information

00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,940
about your your business because and

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:03,090
also listen to the other person because

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,920
you will see that you can leave the work

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:12,360
out with many great ideas that you can

00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:17,310
apply to your project one step farther

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,780
and this is volunteering so if this this

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,000
is true it's only applicable to

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,130
WordPress events because for example

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,190
marketing events or networking events

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,140
are usually organized by an organization

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,570
or institution so you cannot really

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,230
volunteer on those as far as far as I

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:36,180
know as the ones that I've been involved

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:39,300
but in WordPress events yes so you can

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:42,660
go and say yes I want to help you guys

00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,270
with with with a work out how can I do

00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,300
it and then the bones that you're gonna

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:51,210
create by doing this are much more

00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:57,830
stronger than than just attending and

00:18:51,210 --> 00:19:00,390
just talking to people also depending on

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,180
your budget because this is also about

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,700
budget you can a sponsor our WordPress

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:09,450
event so there are different levels of a

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,940
sponsorship and I recommend to to go

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:14,940
with a booth to a worker because it will

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,560
be like your meeting point to to get to

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,960
know your clients your partner's your

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,900
influence or potential influencers your

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,820
potential affiliates and and also you

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,640
can you can show your product as I

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,800
mentioned before and and also you know

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,340
you can for example you can run a game

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,680
or do a raffle and it will attract a lot

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,510
of people so you can get leads as well

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,580
and you can do remarketing afterwards

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:42,300
too to still like keeping this

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,550
connection with them and and also it

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,310
will create a very positive image and it

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:50,240
will have a bigger impact to your to

00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,240
your audience

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,370
glass and this is very important as well

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,370
you will be contributing with some funds

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,320
to the to the ward camp because as you

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,290
know all of this is made by volunteers

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,840
and there is a part that needs like it

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:09,180
cuts because money like the t-shirts and

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,250
materials the catering so this will be

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:19,080
our way also for you to be contributing

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:20,760
today to their work and organizing I'm

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,770
afraid I have no experience on

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,770
organizing our warpless even like a work

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:28,040
at our camp but I've been organizing a

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:31,020
marketing event for four years now and

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,960
and this is like the ultimate branding

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,560
experience because it's when you decide

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,390
what's gonna be the topic of your event

00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,820
who are gonna be the attendees who are

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,700
going to be the speakers what objectives

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,470
you have was gonna be the location so

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,410
you have in control of everything

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,620
so for example with this marketing event

00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:56,040
and the last edition we wanted to to

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:58,620
reach the marketing agencies so it was

00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,870
like we have we created a list of the

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:04,110
attendees that we were aiming for

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:07,350
although the tickets were open so more

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,750
people could come and also we selected

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:14,850
the speakers like taken into account the

00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:16,740
their main expertise like the topics so

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,620
for example to attract like marketing

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,960

00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,810
e-commerce about email marketing in

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,880
social media and so on so those will be

00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,340
the topics that attract them so you will

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,670
be able to get them to your event and

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,700
also you can say oh I would like to

00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:38,100
treat to this influencer who is very

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,300
knowledgeable and SEO for example and I

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,610
don't know how to do it I've been

00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,370
sending emails to him you know but no

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,080

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:49,260

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,220
talk in this marketing event you can

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:56,670
talk about SEO and so on and so this

00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:59,790
influencer will be like more interested

00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,600
in and it will be easier for you to get

00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,340
him on board

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,070
- with our project

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,639
so you can you can position yourself as

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:11,799
a as a kind of an expert on those areas

00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:13,299
in a way because if you are attracting

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,639
those experts it means that you are

00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:19,059
learning from them as well so you want

00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:21,789
to share these these learnings with your

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:24,340
your clients with your known clients and

00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:28,960
also you want apply them to your to your

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,519
product into your company and also you

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,499
know one of the most important things

00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:36,519
when you are creating an event is the

00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:38,619
networking because people one of the

00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,840
main objectives is when they go to an

00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:43,809
event is to do networking a lot of

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,450
networking and that's something that

00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:47,769
people really value and if you I really

00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,519
recommend you to potential with

00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:53,619
potential that on on your event if you

00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:57,249
do that but I don't want you to think

00:22:53,619 --> 00:23:00,309
that it's just about having a huge

00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:02,169
budget about having a huge venue and so

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:05,139
on so it costs a lot of money to do your

00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,509
own your own event it's not like that

00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:10,629
because you can also duel you know like

00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:13,299
in meetup format imagine that you are a

00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:15,159
designer again and you want your

00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,929
designing websites for small and medium

00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,440
businesses so and you know these

00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:23,230
businesses are interested in in email

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,679
marketing for example you know so or in

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,549
in in digital marketing as well so you

00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,279
can create a meet-up

00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:33,190
based on that and then it would be like

00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:35,740
the great meeting point for you to meet

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,710
these potential clients or actual

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,019
clients and and you know that doesn't

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:47,169
cost like a huge amounts of money so

00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:50,289
it's something that you can really do so

00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:53,350

all other things yes so if you are

starting your own company so you you may

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,610
feel sometimes alone now you don't know

how to do it you know it's like you

00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,320
don't have a huge budget to start hiring

00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,750

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,260
of that company involves our business

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:05,570
involved so if you go to the WordPress

00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,760
community and you get involved on it you

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,440
will be able to meet like all these ETS

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,929
that you may need in your company

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:16,220
like for example marketing experts like

00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:18,500
designers developers influencers like

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,390
many different types of people that can

00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,150
help you and give you information and

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,550

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,929
more like less

00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,300
and because you will have like a

00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:33,100
community that will support you because

00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,620
one of the main objectives of the of

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,640
their workers communities to support so

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:44,710
you will see that people don't have are

00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,210
just business vision like oh if I don't

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,070
get anything from you I'm not gonna

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,840
share with you both I know it's not like

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,080
that in the WordPress community they are

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,390
gonna share with you what they know and

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,059
so it will be like in a very ritual

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,670
experience for for you as an

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:02,770
entrepreneur and and for that person as

00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:04,300
well because I'm sure that every

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:08,140
entrepreneur has many things to teach

00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:10,000
other people in the community so that's

00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,340
one of the main reasons I recommend to

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,340
do that so also because of networking

00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,620
and because you can even meet like a

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,900
partner and you can you can do business

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,820
with that person maybe you can get that

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,640
person on board to help you with your

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:27,730
project or you can get maybe you need

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,040
like at a design work and then you can

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,620
get a designer who can do that expa

00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,370
civic work for you or a developer you

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:39,250
know and so on and you can also get like

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:41,470
like social media and noise imagine for

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:45,370
example that you go to a boost from a

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:47,380
sponsor and there is a game so I'm in

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,630
the game because I've done it in in

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,390
marketing events you know this kind of

00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:55,059
stack round frame when you put yourself

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,840
and you just smile and take a picture of

00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:01,270
you and then so and the company publish

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,460
it on their social media and they

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:06,190
mentioned you so then you will be

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:09,040
getting exposure exposure all on that

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,350
audience so it's very beneficial that

00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,080
you mention your company your your

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,429
objectives you know what you do and and

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,580
this is one of the things so there are

00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:20,950
many different things that you can

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,450
liberate and you can take profit and

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:27,179
then you can also share with the

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,179
community so that's my question

00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,399

front maybe from you well we have enough

00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:53,559

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:23,009
interested in doing the sponsor for

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:26,649

question so yes in his name so you will

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,889
have our example we have like many

00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:53,740
hosting providers that are sponsoring

00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:56,619
World Cups usually they they are in the

00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:00,340
position of giving of having like higher

00:29:56,619 --> 00:30:03,399
sponsorship packages and also boots

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,740

00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:09,999
universities there are sponsoring the

00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:15,220
World Cups also local businesses I've

00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:19,240
seen even like glasses shop is

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,950
sponsoring our WordPress meetup it was

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,990
in that case not our cam but you'll see

00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,899
that there are many even local

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:31,990
businesses maybe like food businesses

00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:34,690
like beer companies like the catering as

00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,580
well maybe you can get an agreement with

00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:40,240
a catering you know if you can give them

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,670
this position by brand exposure in

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,740
in exchange of the food or maybe you can

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:48,580
get a discount in that sense you know so

00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:54,280
the catering cost is not that high also

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:57,280
you will see themes plugins and and

00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,680
those are the main the main ones yes but

00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,140
all I am apart from the obvious ones

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,660
which are themes plugins and hosting

00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,130
providers I recommend you also to to

00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,380
spread the word about the local

00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:11,170
businesses there because they may also

00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:25,500
be like interesting Don or be present

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:30,940
there thank you very much

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:39,460
so next a person I'm gonna give you a

00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:48,010
microphone thank you I'm gonna speak in

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:50,680
Japanese I assume you yourself have

00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,510
established some events was set up some

00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,100
events I would like to know your

00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:58,950
experience there are three questions

00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:01,300
first when it comes to community I think

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,690
hosting event is very important however

00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:07,170
other than that what kind of activities

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:10,030
should we not think about doing and

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:12,400
second the question is that when it

00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:16,450
comes to doing event I think there are

00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:19,360
so many work but how frequently do you

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:23,260
think we should have this kind of events

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:27,100
and third question is that if we do host

00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:29,740
an event and invite someone do you think

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,130
it should be free of charge or a paid

00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,750
event and please tell me why you think

00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,120
so

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:39,190
if I if you don't mind let's go one by

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,900
one because there are like many

00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:47,830
questions so the first one

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:51,040
sumimasen so the first one was about it

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:53,530
so are there any events what should we

00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:57,430
do in order to you know

00:32:53,530 --> 00:33:01,600
enhance community so what I've seen in

00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:04,420
Spain is that it's also a lot about the

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,630
local culture so in a Spain we like

00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,290
gathering hanging out like going for a

00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,820
drink

00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:16,210
you know it's not just about it has it

00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,860
has it doesn't have to be about talking

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,620
about WordPress you know

00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,510
so of course WordPress has to be present

00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:27,280
because as the main key point and the

00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:29,290
bond but it's about conveying that with

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,650
the community you will be able to meet

00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:34,960
great people that can help you with your

00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,600
project but can also be become your

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,330
friends so I've met many people that

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,040
they are new in a region for example in

00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,620
Spain or even in another country and

00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,790
they go to a WordPress meetup to meet

00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,770
friends you know it's not just about

00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:54,340
WordPress and what I've seen as well is

00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:57,820
that mmm apart from meetups in apart

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,470
from World Cups you can a few months ago

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,860
in Spain there was like another

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:05,830
WordPress event with families so they

00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,710
went to the countryside for one day and

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:11,260
you know there were talks as well but

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:14,620
they were kind of you know like light

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:16,210
talks like not not in a venue or

00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:20,409
anything like that imagine that you just

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:23,649
go to to to the boots and there is like

00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:25,690
a picnic space and then you gather there

00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:28,000
with your family and with your friends

00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:31,270
from the WordPress community and then

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,770
somebody give some like a fast talk by

00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,530
50 minutes talk something like that

00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:38,320
about topic another personal topic and

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,940
then you just get together and also I've

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,870
seen that it's very important to involve

00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:46,330
families because sometimes you're not

00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:48,610
contributing to the community I can take

00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:51,280
a lot of time and even a lot of personal

00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,820
time so if you can involve your family

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,110
as well you will be able to share this

00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:03,340
experience with with them as well and

00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:06,599
also you can do like like you know like

00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:10,349
the translator days as well

00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:13,289
quite popular Sanders pain as well but

00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:15,479
it's basically about just combining like

00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:18,930
some knowledge about workers that they

00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:21,450
can take away and also some fun some

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:24,900
having fun with with the people and some

00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:27,239
creating bonds and making networking

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,009
with them but you know it is this

00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,380
example I gave you about the countryside

00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:33,569
this is one of the latest and for me it

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:44,940
was a very good idea to combine

00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:49,049
everything thank you second question so

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,479
my second question is so in such event I

00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:54,509
think I was quite impressed about what

00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:57,660
you have just talked so frequency would

00:35:54,509 --> 00:36:01,619
it be once a month or once a year is

00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:05,789
enough what do you think well it depends

00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:07,380
so for example if you are organizing an

00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:12,960
event like the marketing when I talk

00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:14,880
about it's a huge event so then it's for

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,150
me it's once a year because it involves

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,239
like months of work of doing that if you

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,890
are just or cameras in like a meet-up it

00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,719
depends on your connection as well

00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:29,269
because you you need to have a speaker

00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:32,160
to to you know to make them the dimittam

00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:35,009
so if you have many connections of you

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,539
have a good list of speakers there maybe

00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:38,969
it's easier for you to do once a month

00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:42,630
for a meet-up i recommend once a month

00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:44,670
and also it you know like the same week

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,029
on the in the same day for example the

00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:51,989
third Thursday of the third week you

00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:54,989
know so people have like a date on the

00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:58,229
calendar and they know that on the on

00:36:54,989 --> 00:37:01,619
the Thursday of the third week they they

00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:03,660
have your meetup on word comes

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,910
it depends as well but for example in

00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,009
Spain this year we had around 10 work

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,630
comes and next year were expected to

00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:11,700
have more actually next year we are

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,970
expected to have at least one workout

00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,339
per month so

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:19,400
so it really depends on on the Avenger

00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:23,390
one you want to attend to a sponsor to

00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:27,670
to organize so depending on that but

00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:29,900
it's true that if it has to to be quite

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,880
frequent if it's like a meter for

00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,339
example because otherwise you will lose

00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,730
the people you will you want to engage

00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:40,849
people to always attend to your to your

00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:44,060
meetup because there are so many meetups

00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:46,819
and in general and we are we all are

00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:50,000
very busy with work with family with

00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:52,730
personal sales so so it's important that

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,740
you create that date with with people at

00:37:52,730 --> 00:38:00,410
least once a month I think it would be

00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:04,869
it will be fine yes I go my third

00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:08,630
question finally

00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:12,680
so the midok would be free of charge and

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:15,200
an event should be paid event or do you

00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,040
think it should be also free of charge

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,130
do you have any opinion so for example

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,900
for this marketing event I told you I

00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:28,310
organized at the beginning it was free

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:32,569
and now we have established our fee and

00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:34,069
part of this fee goes to an NGO so you

00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:36,770
can do as well some charity work you

00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:38,930
know but it's also depends of your of

00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,819
your budget because maybe you need all

00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:43,040
these money to cover the expenses of the

00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,569
event so it depends but if you can do

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,220
you can keep some part for a chai tea

00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:52,270
then it would be it would be great but

00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:55,760
I've seen as well that if you give

00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:58,910
ticket for free completely for free at

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,650
listen in in Spain in my experience and

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,859
in England as well in other another

00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:06,010
countries like work with own people

00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:09,859
don't value because people don't value

00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,420
free things because you know even even

00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:12,980
though you think there is a value

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,790
because you are aware that there is a

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:20,270
value for that using eyes for free so so

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,980
you don't you don't think that it's you

00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:25,860
know if if in the end you can you cannot

00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:28,260
really attend maybe you cannot even say

00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,850
sorry I cannot attend jus-just and show

00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,850
up and then people who are organizing

00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:35,580
the event are just there with pretty

00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:38,670
much no one and in it's a lot of effort

00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,110
so I think it's good to put a price it's

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:43,380
true that with meetups you are not gonna

00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:47,640
put a price because it's a meet-up so

00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:49,980
without work and yes it's different but

00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,660
I've seen that for example in the in the

00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,410
meetup in the WordPress meetup in Madrid

00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:58,470
it happened several times that they

00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:01,560
organized it many many people didn't

00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:04,860
show up you know and it was it's a very

00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:09,000
big sum it happens in Google campus so

00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:12,330
it's a big room that can fit like 100

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,850
150 people and it was pretty much empty

00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,950
and then the organizers decided to write

00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,550
a blog post saying look this is not

00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,130
right

00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:22,650
so it's effort that everyone is putting

00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,500
into it we are doing it for free and

00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:28,140
because we believe on it so at least we

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,180
deserve some respect if you cannot

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:34,710
attend we understand but at least let us

00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:37,260
know so it's important that you conveyed

00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:46,080
this value to people in in case you are

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:50,270
doing it with no right for free thank

00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,270
you I learned a lot from you thank you

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,370
thank you very much any others

00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,420
so the person in front maybe this will

00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:08,100
be the last question

00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:11,220
due to time so it's not really a

00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:15,240
question but you supplement but press

00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:19,530
event managed by volunteers this is

00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:24,960
principle so even if we have revenue we

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:27,600
will donate so that's and also like we

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,050
have to pay some expenses for venue or

00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,430
something that's really necessary and

00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,860
there's an organization called world

00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:37,020
place Foundation where we can donate too

00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,010
so if you have any revenue please try to

00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:44,160
donate

00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:48,210
to them thank you do you look at it

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:52,040
let's see let's see okay I hope you will

00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,040
contribute more and more going forward

00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:04,219
