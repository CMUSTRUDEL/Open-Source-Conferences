Title: Mike Schroder: The Future of WordPress
Publication date: 2020-02-22
Playlist: WordCamp Osaka 2019
Description: 
	I was the release lead for WordPress 4.5, and a Media focus lead for 5.3. The project has significantly changed the way releases have run, moving from a single lead to many. Come to learn more about how WordPress releases are run and direction of organization in the WordPress project.

you're gonna catch mice

00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:15,600
[Applause]

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:18,660
all right the future of WordPress so

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,099
this is a pretty big topic when that was

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,990
initially asked to talk about it I

00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:25,710
wasn't entirely sure what I was going to

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,630
going to to speak about but I think

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,039
together let's talk through some

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,160
different things that have been going on

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,230
in the project and some ideas on where

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,330
things could go is just a quick

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,830
disclaimer upfront these are all my

00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,239
thoughts and opinions not anything

00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,690
official from the project or anything

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,140
like that so take that take that as you

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,180
may I think when folks usually talk

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,700
about the future of WordPress when I've

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,129
been to talks that are kind of titled

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,739
like this in the past I've heard a lot

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,840
about about headless WordPress so we're

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,170
WordPress something else is using the

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,050
information from WordPress via an API or

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,300
or something like that and I do actually

00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,369
think that those uses are super

00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,450
interesting so I'm gonna start talking

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,880
about that briefly and how that sort of

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,590
broadens gradually what WordPress is

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,250
used for and changes the way that we

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,619
think about WordPress from a couple of

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,490
years ago I really like this this

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:30,630
presentation from hey this on about the

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,220
way that using Alexa to pull information

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:40,649
from WordPress because it takes

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:42,899
WordPress and basically takes in

00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:44,819
emerging technology and then connects

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,649
that with WordPress in a way that at

00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,509
least I certainly hadn't hadn't thought

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,119
about it it's an integration with the

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,450
REST API I think it's a really good

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,940
implementation there and it's at the

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,979
edge definitely especially when it was

00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,289
first when this was first released of

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,420
what WordPress is used for another

00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:07,099
really cool example that I saw kind of

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,080
recently is Anthony Burch Elle's work on

00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:12,360
extended reality and WordPress so he's

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,870
been doing some work on integrating

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,580
WordPress with with VR and AR systems

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,380
and things like that two different stuff

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,590
so like this is an example of what a

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,250
post might look like extended back out

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,640
about about

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,750
and this is all open source so you can

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,240
also go in there if you want to play

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,790
around with it a little bit then that's

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,920
on github and you can take a look yeah I

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,860
think it's pretty cool he's also working

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,090
on another one that is an AR music

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,890
creation app called broke in place and

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,170
this I don't think is quite released yet

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:51,340
but there are some videos if you want to

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:53,440
or if you go to the WP tavern link or

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,630
search even just or just go to a broken

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,300
place com you can see a video example

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,340
and it's kind of neat you can look

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,610
around with a cell phone and you can

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,350
choose the instruments that you want to

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,810
play by looking around wherever you are

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,270
and the way that it connects with

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,430
WordPress is that it uses WordPress as a

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,720
back-end you I mean I at least would

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,200
never guess that it used WordPress

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,890
looking at the application but it can

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,500
save music that different people are are

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,200
generating and combine them so people

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,200
can collaborate and saves that in the

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,440
backend so I think that's pretty cool I

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,269
guess

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,030
all this to say that I think that

00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,350
diversity of application matters when it

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,209
comes to WordPress

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:42,910
to use to use WordPress in sort of the

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,940
broadest way possible and I think it

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,910
shows how much a certain platform can

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,650
stretch to support emerging technologies

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,920
in the future I think it also applies

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,900
here to diversity of users and folks

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,950
that are developing with it the wider

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,900
variety of folks that use software the

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,880
broader that knowledge is that can be

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:08,620
shared with the community to inform

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:11,650
future direction so I don't see this in

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,709
this sort of talk very often but I'm

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,660
gonna go ahead and do it let's to set up

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,390
sort of the rest of our conversation it

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:24,520
is possible that in the future WordPress

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:26,770
may fail ya know technologies tend to

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,960
run their course until something that

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,220
fits the need better comes along and so

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,550
I think this is important to think about

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,200
because this is not the ideal this is

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,640
not what we want at least I'm gonna go

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,430
ahead and assume that folks coming to a

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,840
word camp

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,030
this is not the future that you want

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,340
this is not the future that I want I

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,979
think the alternative for this that

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,259
would be ideal would for WordPress

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:53,800
fulfilling its mission of democratizing

00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:56,539
publishing is that WordPress changes and

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,750
what I mean by this is that as

00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:02,360
technology emerges I think the extent to

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,789
which WordPress can accomplish this

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,560
mission is is going to depend on its

00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:12,590
ability to adapt right now democratizing

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,479
publishing looks like very similar to

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,310
what what WordPress looks like but

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,410
already is in is starting to include

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,190
things that probably WordPress doesn't

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,960
do natively yet like perhaps a better

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,190
video support or things like that that

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,350
folks would really like to be able to

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,760
publish in an easier fashion and I

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,710
imagine that there are lots of these

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,310
things that I can't even imagine at this

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,830
point so to me this ability of WordPress

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,430
as not only a project but as a community

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,199
to evolve is how we continue into the

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,789
future so that WordPress continues to

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:49,250
succeed so to start let's take a look at

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:51,470
WordPress where WordPress is now and how

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:55,909
well WordPress is set up to change over

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,590
time WordPress is definitely growing and

00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:01,070
this is an indicator that a lot of folks

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,440
talk about in terms of future success so

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,800
let's chat about a few of the different

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,570
ways that that at least I see WordPress

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,409
is growing I think the clearest metric

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:15,880
is an install count so earlier this year

00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:17,419
it was announced that WordPress was

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,430
33.4%

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,580
of installs on the web and this is up

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,789
from 30% last year the wordpress.org

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,310
about page has has also been updated to

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:31,130
say that WordPress is now over 35% which

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,750
is super exciting to increase by 5% of

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,360
the Internet in a year I don't know I

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,310
can't even that's hard for me to imagine

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,780
so short of something catastrophic I

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,970
don't like I don't think that this is

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,889
gonna change suddenly because one of the

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,870
benefits of the open web and of

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:47,300
WordPress is that all of these sites are

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,580
or at least many of the sites are hosted

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,230
independently and so all of those folks

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,890
have the freedom to continue to

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:57,950
you to develop those on their own so

00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,860
this is cool I think that it gives

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:04,210
WordPress a lot of runway to be able to

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,410
adjust and it also provides some of that

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,500
increased as there are more folks

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,240
increased diversity of application and

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,090
increased diversity of users that we

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,250
were talking about one of the

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,010
difficulties that comes from a project

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:23,360
this big is that it's kind of hard to

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:26,450
steer that such a big ship so for

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,600
WordPress to us to succeed to change it

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,880
has to have those resources and

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,250
resources vision and organization to be

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:38,770
able to change direction so let's start

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:41,390
out with with communication of vision so

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,920
during the last couple of years Matt

00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,390
Mullenweg

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,800
y'all are many of y'all are probably

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,600
familiar with but for those who are not

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,380
is one of the cofounders of WordPress

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:55,670
and has been leading the project for

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:58,100
some time has taken a more vocal and

00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,830
forward lead in communicating vision and

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,570
I'm really excited about this so I think

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:07,060
that there's a lot of WordPress growth

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:09,680
in project organization that's happening

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:13,580
last at last year's state of the word

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,130
which is a an annual speech that Matt

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,470
gives about sort of what's going on with

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,480
WordPress what he might expect to come

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:25,670
next and plans for the future he

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,820
detailed basically the next steps for

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,650
WordPress so first and ending last year

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,200
there was a new editor that was released

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:37,460
that moved called Guttenberg so that's

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,330
what that's what this is that changed

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:46,010
the editing experience within a within

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:49,880
the single post from tiny MCE to a new

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:53,300
block format where where things are more

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:57,800
based on objects in a pager post rather

00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,290
than rather than text and there are some

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,270
next phases that are coming up so this

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,640
this is where we are right now we're in

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,130
phase 2 and this is

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,230
slowly starting to move outside of that

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:12,620
post content and to focus on

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:16,850
customization it's worth noting that any

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:19,370
so I've made sure to include links at

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,050
the bottom of most of the slides that

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,430
are here because one of the cool things

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,080
to me at least about the WordPress

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,760
community is that all of this

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,020
information is open so if you want to

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,460
know about future plans or if you want

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,840
to know about what's happening in

00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,940
organization how decisions are made

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,150
things like that you can always go and

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:41,180
you can see in in public posts and in

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,560
videos and and things like that exactly

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,970
what's happening and you can get

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,500
involved so the link that's at the

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,540
bottom here will take you to that talk

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,310
so you can watch it if you like and I'm

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,620
reasonably sure that there are subtitles

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:58,880
there too that are translated both for

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,790
that one and for this year's the next

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,260
one that's coming up is phase 3 I don't

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,500
know exactly when this is gonna start

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,210
but it's slated for afterwards and this

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,960
is collaboration so this is kind of a

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:14,300
neat one the idea being to allow kind of

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,220
like in Google Docs for folks to be able

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,090
to edit a page or a post at the same

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,570
time and Gutenberg helps set that up by

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,970
moving by moving editing to blocks so

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,870
I'm pretty excited about that the one

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,550
that I think though is probably gonna

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,580
change things the most is the one that

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,290
can that comes after that which is an

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,420
official way to support multilingual

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,300
websites in WordPress and to support

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,150
multilingual natively within WordPress

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,180
and Gutenberg and I think this one has

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:49,130
been far too long coming honestly but

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm really really excited to see this on

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,800
the official project priorities and I'm

00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:59,360
looking forward to to that process

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,030
starting so after he announced these

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,550
things and I'm basically I'm gonna walk

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,840
through a little bit here with

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,300
organization and how things tend to Hut

00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,830
to things tend to flow and fortunately

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,270
we've got some really great examples

00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,720
from this year so after this was

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:17,690
announced right afterward there was a

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
post on make dot wordpress.org slash

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,550
core from

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,790
about all of the projects and sort of

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,800
how those those plans and those focuses

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,900
of the things that were coming next

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,990
might look in projects and that was

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,630
starting and that started planning so

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,720
you can go and you can see all that just

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,550
last night there was another update so

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,530
this was because this was last year and

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,780
now we're at the about at the end of

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,190
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,880
Josefa who is the executive director of

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,230
wordpress posted this update and you can

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,990
go and you can see what's happened this

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,680
year with each of those priorities and

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:59,490
focuses there's also a a fairly new page

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:03,450
on wordpress.org slash about slash

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:06,150
roadmap that has the details of all of

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:09,090
this and sort of where the community and

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,910
where the project is in in planning and

00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:16,980
in execution so that's a cool place to

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:21,350
see it connected with vision there is

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,060
also a lot of movement in terms of

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,340
experimenting with different leadership

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,640
models and this is an entirely new

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,650
WordPress as a project has been

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,620
experimenting with exactly how to run

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,170
the project for at the very least as

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,790
long as I've been a part of the project

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,410
matt has been has been leading it but

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,990
the way that everything else gets run

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:46,500
with releases and with leadership and

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,130
with like basically how everything is

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,230
organized has changed a lot over time I

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,690
think this is really healthy to continue

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,610
to evaluate and to see what's working

00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,280
best for the community at any particular

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:03,060
time and it's really encouraging to see

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:07,100
this as part of that Josefa Hayden

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:10,650
became the executive director and and

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,230
Yost also had I'm now I'm struggling cuz

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:16,800
I didn't write down the exact title was

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:19,260
a marketing was a marketing lead since

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,440
then they both decided to do something

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,060
different and I think that's also really

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,660
encouraging there's a there's a long

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,520
post that Yost made after he stepped

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,200
back from that position about all of the

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,339
things that happened and about how he

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,689
felt about it

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,269
and they decided to try something

00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:39,089
different I think that continuing to

00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:41,579
that transparency in terms of how things

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,350
are how things are working and in terms

00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:46,430
of continuing to change things so they

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,870
work better it is really encouraging

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,279
afterward

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,709
Josefa started posting other other

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:55,529
details about thinking about

00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:58,499
organization there's a post that went up

00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:02,519
about asking to see if folks were

00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:04,649
interested in being leads and so you can

00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,889
still go and comment on that if you'd

00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:08,459
like

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:11,910
and they've she started to build out

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,319
some documentation and training for

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,809
folks that are interested in leadership

00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:18,300
and so that's something to look forward

00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:20,160
to as far as I'm aware that is still in

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,959
progress but there are drafts that are

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,629
available to read whenever you would

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:29,730
like following that she continued and

00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:32,899
did some research on the way that

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:35,809
WordPress works right now and so

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:38,490
basically the current way that

00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:40,259
leadership is attained and that folks

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,819
folks are able to get involved and this

00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,860
is really interesting reading if you're

00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:46,470
interested in kind of knowing the way

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,850
that things are it's not necessarily the

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,120
things that are the way that things

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,740
should be but it's interesting to be

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,370
able to at least to me it was

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:59,610
interesting to see basically some of

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:03,540
those things validated in an outside way

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:05,759
and also to let more folks who are not

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,620
actively involved understand the process

00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,069
as it exists now and to be able to work

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,559
within that in a better way one of the

00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,509
proposals that came out of that was to

00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,540
create a WordPress advisory board of

00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:22,290
various folks from the ecosystem and so

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:26,009
that is one that is being acted on and

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,540
is is plan to move forward and yeah

00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,769
these are all public posts so definitely

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,230
if you want to follow along with how

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:33,029
that's working then make that WordPress

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,879
set org slash updates is a good place to

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:38,040
do that another place that organization

00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,199
has been experimented with over time is

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,980
though is how WordPress releases are run

00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:45,550
and I really do think that there's a lot

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,130
of growth

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,660
WordPress contribution so let's talk

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,790
about how things look here I'm gonna

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,950
draw a little bit from my recent

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,410
experience as media focus lead for

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:59,800
WordPress 5.3 and compare it with some

00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:03,850
other releases that I had something to

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:07,060
do with leadership in so let's step back

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:10,210
a few years back to 2014 this is the

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:13,630
first time that I that I did anything

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:17,320
with leadership of a release and I

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:20,050
started out as as a deputy and ended

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,980
with nason or Andrew Nason who was the

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:26,290
main the primary lead at the time

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,680
basically calling me a co-lead which was

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,300
very very kind of him so that's the only

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,510
reason it's listed as two leads but

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,480
there were two people and and then two

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:40,000
hundred and sixty-seven contributors

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,250
both folks both co-leads based in the

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,010
United States contributors of course

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,440
from around the world I would say that

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,410
it in any given time one thing that I

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,840
think folks I don't know if talk about

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,090
it that much or not but there are often

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,000
a lot of contributors that are listed

00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:01,570
for a release and and that's amazing

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,880
and every single contribution is super

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,709
important one thing that's changed over

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,260
time is the amount of folks that have

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,620
time every day to spend a lot of time on

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,010
it though so like during WordPress 3.9 I

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,500
would estimate that probably just

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:20,620
probably around to just under 20 people

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,180
actually had time that they could give

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,900
you know every day or something like

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,200
that and so we'll talk a little bit more

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:32,910
about how that's changed in the next

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:37,620
release it was a team of three myself

00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:41,820
Mel choice and and adam silverstein as

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:45,130
design lead and deputy respectively and

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,480
also still all based in the States

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,070
the numbers went up a bit I don't think

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,080
this was a high but this was pretty

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:57,610
close so we went from a 267 to 298

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,350
in two years and so the numbers we can

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,410
see that they're starting to slope up

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,600
not a serious change and it's still

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,380
three people I can say that from this

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,160
experience

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:11,230
it was often it was really nice to have

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,260
someone else to to have that extra

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,880
person to be able to to be able to talk

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,010
to and be able to help out with things

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,280
when I didn't have the time but it was

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:26,100
still kind of a struggle to be just just

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:30,760
a couple of people managing managing 298

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:33,400
contributors so I'm very happy to say

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,770
that the most recent release WordPress

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:40,570
5.3 so that was just released this year

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:43,750
was a release team of 12 and this was

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,850
completely transformative for me and my

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:49,210
understanding of the way that releases

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:52,330
can work I think I think this is way

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:55,510
more healthy so in this case every

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,900
person had their own usually component

00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:02,740
to work on or for instance or marketing

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:06,669
or running meetings or that sort of a

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,770
thing with varied well-defined tasks for

00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,940
each person to work on and it was also a

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:14,919
global team made of folks spanning

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,630
spanning around the world and so if I

00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,880
found myself in trouble and it was

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,820
really late at night in Japan and I had

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,100
to go to sleep I could always say hey

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,750
could you take care of this for me and

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,840
there was always someone that had just

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:33,669
woken up or was already awake that was

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,650
in Europe or or we also had had a

00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,840
contributor from Africa and we had some

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,850
some of their folks from well basically

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,260
it was across all the time zones and so

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,970
there was always someone that could say

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:48,429
oh yeah hey please go sleep be healthy I

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:51,630
will help you and so this is super

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:55,510
encouraging for me the just the room

00:19:51,630 --> 00:20:01,330
where we were coordinating the release

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:03,010
was about 18 people that's pretty close

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,640
to the amount of people that were

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:09,220
spending their time all the time like

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,400
that had regular hours to spend on those

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,100
other two releases three years and

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,850
and I'm missing my counting six years

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:22,330
ago so this is super encouraging for me

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:25,120
I'm I'm feeling very optimistic on how

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,460
the on how this has changed so release

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,370
teams larger release team started with

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,930
as an experiment in WordPress 5.0 and so

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,820
they continued with five point one and

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,910
five point three I really really hope

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,430
that this continues to go because it's

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:44,530
been I think it's very very good for a

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:47,200
wordpress another thing that this I

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,390
think was started in at wordcamp europe

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,220
maybe three or four years ago is five

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,160
for the future and if y'all aren't

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,130
already familiar this is something that

00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:00,070
matt proposed that if you're working

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:03,250
with wordpress that you spend five

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:06,610
percent of resources in some way to help

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,820
wordpress top wordpress succeed and

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,440
continue to succeed and so if you do

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,830
regularly spend time on wordpress

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,360
whether or not you work for whether or

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,190
not it's sponsored even if it's in your

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,310
spare time you can go here to this link

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,930
and you can sign up and you can have it

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,940
displayed on a page where it shows

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,710
different people who are who are

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,120
contributing and if you do work for a

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:31,540
company that's sponsoring your time

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,820
companies can also now go and sign up to

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,350
the page and display all of their

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,630
employees that are spending time on

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,220
wordpress so that everyone can see the

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,780
commitment and i think it's pretty cool

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,780
to recognize companies in that way

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,990
another place i think that's seen a lot

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,460
of growth is is in the editor and

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,680
alluded to this a little bit earlier so

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,440
this is a screenshot from the wordpress

00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,030
4.5 release video actually i actually

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,220
have no no issues with the classic

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:03,760
editor i think it's pretty cool but I'm

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:07,810
also really happy to see that this is a

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:12,610
screenshot from 4.9 it doesn't look from

00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:15,070
not 4.0 from 5.3 and I am glad of course

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,200
that it that I think this looks quite a

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,240
bit more modern but also the API is

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,400
allowing developers to expand

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,540
functionality in WordPress via blocks I

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,200
think it's the biggest forward-looking

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,450
change it also changed the languages

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,050
that are used in the background to ones

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,670
that are more modern and kind of

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,560
expected in terms of it makes it a lot

00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,350
easier to expand the editor than it was

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,930
before and so I think that that will

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,570
will help a lot with increasing that

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:47,020
diversity of application it's also

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,430
encouraged a lot of contribution so I

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,230
took the screen shot last night I don't

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:55,270
know if we've hit 500 yet but this is

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:59,650
499 contributors just to the editor just

00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:01,000
to Guttenberg so far I said just a

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,830
minute ago the editor represents growth

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,330
in WordPress and I think that's true but

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:08,440
perhaps a better way of talking about

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the Gutenberg Project is that it is

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,570
involved with growing with improving

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:17,470
user experience and not just with the

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:21,790
editor and that's due mainly to the

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:25,060
phases that are coming up next to expand

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:27,790
to basically to handle more of what the

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,400
admin panel currently handles so one

00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,850
example of this if you go to this URL

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,260
you can kind of see a longer video where

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,500
where they talk about it just a little

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,180
bit more but the idea is to expand with

00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,150
the editor does right now to allow full

00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,130
full page full site editing directly

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,680
inline and I'll zoom in to the top just

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,240
a little bit it was noted my TS who

00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,100
wrote the page and there are a lot of

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,140
technical details on there too if that's

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,860
really interesting to you you can go and

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:59,410
see and he did note that the drop-down

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,240
at the top over there is probably or may

00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,630
not be the way that it looks at the end

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,730
it was just to make it easy to to give

00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,620
sort of a prototype but I love how there

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,120
are different modes that make it really

00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,700
easy for users that want to get

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,440
different things done to get what they

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,690
need to do or to get done what they need

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,420
to do so if you want to design it's

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:21,040
really clear how all the spacing works

00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,320
but if you're just interested in editing

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,690
editing content then you don't need to

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,660
worry about any of that part of the site

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:33,210
so I don't know I'm I'm pretty excited

00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:35,830
about about where this is going and yeah

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,870
if you have any comments to make of

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,820
course all of this is ongoing right now

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,930
so this is not already in WordPress the

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,790
something that's being worked on and

00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,700
then github repo right now so if you'd

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:49,120
like to contribute or you have you know

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,920
comments questions concerns absolutely

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,300
all of that can can still happen and

00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,510
would love to have your help

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:59,310
I think another place that WordPress has

00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:04,000
seen a lot of growth is in community and

00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:05,590
I this is this is even bigger than than

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,590
I I think have the time to talk about

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:13,390
but I'm really excited to see how much

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:15,670
WordPress is growing and so there this

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,970
was in matte state of the word this year

00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:22,180
there 141 word camps this year in the

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,920
world 34 of those are in new cities so

00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:28,060
those the new folks that we were talking

00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,990
about and 17 kids camps which is neat to

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:34,390
help introduce kids to WordPress and

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,000
5,000 meetup events or more than 5,000

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:41,140
which is really cool and I know a lot of

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,850
each of those are in Japan and in in in

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:48,370
your communities so thank you so much I

00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:51,100
think that this increasing this

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:54,160
diversity and contribution be it in

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:56,970
community or be it in core or basically

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,740
throughout the project really matters i

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:03,100
I've I've enjoyed seeing this in other

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:06,850
places in core to like there was a focus

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,770
in WordPress 5.3 in increasing

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,230
accessibility because some folks noticed

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:13,270
late last year that there was some

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,000
issues with accessibility in Gutenberg

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:19,180
and so there was a community sponsored

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,910
effort to go and to do an audit on all

00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:25,840
of Gutenberg to find problems with

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:28,060
accessibility and to and they went and

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,630
created a bunch of tickets a bunch of

00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:33,820
tasks to complete in in WordPress core

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,380
to make those things better and so there

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,130
were a lot of fixes that went in and

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,560
there was a lot of rallying around

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,660
helping out with that and I definitely

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,730
believe that the wider group the wider

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,800
the wider set of folks with with

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:53,560
different backgrounds and from different

00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:56,050
places helps it makes the team

00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,010
a whole it makes all helps all of us

00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:01,960
better know and understand this change

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,610
and I think that the more folks that are

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,260
included the better off the project

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:10,240
would be it's a little bit of a side

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,130
note but very much connected yeah it's

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,470
not really a side note I'd like to talk

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:18,940
a little bit about a pack inclusion so I

00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:20,650
think some teams like polyglots and

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,680
community have done this for a while but

00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,410
I'm I'm glad to see that there are some

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,080
more changes in the teams that I'm most

00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,460
connected with are our core and hosting

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,730
and there been some changes there

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:37,150
recently to not only have the

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,820
information posted on on the site you

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,530
you've been able to see for a while the

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,790
what things people talk about in

00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,970
meetings but it's really hard to

00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:49,240
participate from Japan and from from the

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:52,810
general area from from a pack so core

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,940
has introduced a every other week at

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,880
triage session that is at 2 p.m.

00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:00,160
jst which is super great I'm really

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,230
excited about and there's going to be

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,870
one with the hosting team that also gets

00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:06,610
added for that and we're in working on

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:12,580
having one of those for the media

00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:13,720
component as well so I so I really hope

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,390
that that helps if there are other

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,340
places where people where y'all field

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,350
that you're having trouble connecting

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,710
with I would love to hear more about

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,970
that I'd also personally love to see

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:29,620
more opportunities for folks this that

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:33,430
primarily speak languages other than

00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:36,790
English to more easily contribute what

00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:39,100
one way that I guess as one example that

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,380
I've seen this work before is with the

00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,760
the Japanese hosting community team

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,640
which i think is really really cool

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,880
because the team gets together in

00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,040
Japanese and then connects with the with

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,240
the hosting community team in English I

00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,470
don't know that that needs to be the

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,180
language that's used for ever but

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,310
because it it's the one that's being

00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,200
used now that allows folks that

00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:01,660
otherwise wouldn't be able to contribute

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,490
to the conversation to contribute and I

00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,860
think that's interesting I would love to

00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:09,140
see to see that improve so

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:13,100
please please come chat with me if you

00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:17,120
have any ideas on how we can improve it

00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:19,190
so to summarize I think that change the

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,299
places I'm some of the places I'm seeing

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:25,299
change are in usage and application a

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:28,100
diversity of application organization

00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:31,070
contribution user experience and

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:34,040
community I think things are moving in a

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:37,370
generally good direction but what are

00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,600
some ways that it could improve when I

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,890
was initially asked to talk about the

00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,960
future of WordPress one of the things

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:44,480
that I thought about was why are you

00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,980
asking me this question because one

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,679
person can't no I can't no or guide

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,080
everything that happens with WordPress

00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,760
it depends on a global team around the

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,090
world working together with it so I'd

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,620
like to turn this around a little bit

00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:06,049
I'm interested in knowing what what

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:07,640
you're building with WordPress what are

00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:14,840
your customers need with need from

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:17,600
WordPress separately what do what do you

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,010
wish you could build or what but you

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,610
what do you currently need from

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:25,610
WordPress but you don't have and I think

00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:28,580
I think beyond needs what I what I most

00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:32,240
interested in hearing about is what you

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:35,320
wish WordPress could be what would the

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,059
mission of democratizing publishing if

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:41,630
if we didn't have WordPress and you just

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:43,340
heard we need to democratize publishing

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,780
what would be the thing that you would

00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,490
create what would that look like now

00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:50,419
what do you think it's going to look

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:52,580
like and I asked that mainly because I

00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:55,460
do think that the the the future of

00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,559
WordPress is that change because no

00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,480
matter what happens the world is going

00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,929
to continue to change around WordPress

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,520
and how well WordPress accomplishes this

00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:07,760
mission is going to depend on how all of

00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,740
us respond so put a little more clearly

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,929
this is a little cheesy but I think that

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,270
it but I think that it follows I think

00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:17,330
the the future of WordPress is in all of

00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,770
you I think that the the growth

00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,600
opportunities that I talked about

00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,490
they're all they all require

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,560
having a large group of global folks

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:29,180
working together so including including

00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,610
everyone including designers users

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,550
implementers developers engineers

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,920
business folks

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:39,050
WordPress will evolve based on all of

00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,240
you who are here and the great thing

00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:45,530
about WordPress is that you get to

00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,590
decide what your role is in it thanks so

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,590
much

00:31:53,750 --> 00:32:00,980
I finally got those was I must have

00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:06,160
sorry mothers Khushi that was good

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,160
well we still have some time for Q&A so

00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:13,130
Mike would love to invite some of the

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,720
question from the floor so if you have

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:26,270
any question please raise your hand and

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:29,960
let us know can I speak in Japanese well

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:35,750
Japanese okay I'm gonna give you a

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:38,300
microphone so please wait a sec thank

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,970
you very much for your presentation it

00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,470
was quite interesting made me think a

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:47,060
lot

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:56,750
so from Japan what kind of contribution

00:32:47,060 --> 00:33:01,850
do you expect from Japan think I don't

00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:05,480
think I have any expectations I I think

00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:09,290
that I I would love I of course would

00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,120
love to see folks feel like they can get

00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,400
more involved and to into graduate

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,920
become more involved I think already the

00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:20,150
Japanese WordPress community is doing a

00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:23,900
lot and I'm really I am very encouraged

00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:28,030
by the community in Japan and so I think

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:31,100
I think it's less that I have any

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,870
expectations on what might happen and

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,580
more that I would love to make it easier

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:39,140
because I think right now especially

00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:40,940
with core it's very hard to contribute

00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,510
and so I would love to know ways that

00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:55,000
can make it easier the sec answer your

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:55,000
question thank you very much

00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,660
[Music]

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:08,740
your home what a mistake I didn't

00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:11,020
abandon you mother please so the

00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,389
Japanese language had the second largest

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,649
share in the world breasts however we

00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:22,720
are not catching up with the translating

00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:24,580
lots of materials so this may be a kind

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,100
of inhibitor to increase our

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:30,869
contribution from Japan but anyway they

00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,869
have any other question pool or the

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,000
person in the back

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,250
it to be a question I included wishes on

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:51,850
here on purpose hello if you want to

00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:55,000
share what you are excited to either see

00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,770
or wish you saw from WordPress I would

00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,620
love to hear that too

00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,880
hello Mike it was a good presentation by

00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,300
the way thank you so much for this thank

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,760
you

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:08,380
actually I'm currently leading team

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,320
review team in what was chartered so we

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,330
are currently five six representatives

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,590
which is what leading team debut team

00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,020
right now

00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:19,960
a few months ago we were planning to

00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:24,210
change leads because all of the previous

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,650
leaves are tired and wants some rest and

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,420
they have been doing contribution since

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:32,920
long but actually we call for the

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,600
application are we requested in our

00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,870
meeting that we want to be the next

00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,680
leader who want to join the team as a

00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:45,040
leader representatives but no one is

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,550
ready so we need to request our previous

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:53,140
lead to continue the same position so

00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:56,020
what do you think that people who are

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,880
interested in leading things are doing

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,120
workplace things but they are not ready

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,660
to contribute so most a long time in for

00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,720
free are there was some restriction that

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:11,440
they are not able to join the team what

00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:14,740
do you think so you mean if folks want

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,660
to be able to contribute more but they

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,590
currently don't have the time or the

00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,980
resources to do so

00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,780
yeah yeah but our team is really

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,870
saturated means they have been doing

00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:28,420
lots of time so we call for another

00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,970
release alternatively but there was no

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:34,000
there was no one ready to take the

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,710
position what might be the problem or

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,440
what might be the cause that no one is

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:44,950
ready for taking team give you lead

00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:48,160
position well I think I don't want to I

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:50,840
I don't I'm not a member of the team and

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,000
so I I don't want to

00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:59,130
so I don't know what the reasons exactly

00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,450
might be I know at least in the hosting

00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,730
community team maybe I'll talk about

00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:04,140
that one instead because I'm not sure

00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,460
what's happening internally in that one

00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,920
although I would love to chat about it

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,810
afterward I meant to say that you

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,850
already said that and what price have

00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,970
the training team as well they provide

00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:17,400
the training and Joseph also write a

00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,620
post about who and to do in the team

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,280
they can comment you always say that so

00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:25,200
but lots of people are actively

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,310
involving in team ribbiting but they are

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,080
not ready to take the lead position so

00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:36,290
what might be the reason for that if you

00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:39,750
have any idea did they did you ask them

00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:42,150
yeah we asked them but we call them for

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:45,210
the lead position but they are not ready

00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,100
to say that they made some various

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,960
reasons that I don't have time or I

00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,960
can't do it for free for the long time

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,040
so so yeah I think I think that's a

00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,110
really common one and that's in in teams

00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,720
that I've worked with I mean I feel very

00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:04,560
privileged to be able to spend time on

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,660
on WordPress I can't remember if you

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,210
mentioned this at the beginning but I my

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,280
time is donated by GoDaddy is sponsored

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,140
by GoDaddy so I have that's the reason

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,370
that I have time as much time as I do to

00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,420
work on WordPress and I'm very grateful

00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:22,340
for that I think that a lot of times

00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:25,530
folks want to contribute more but they

00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,180
don't have enough they don't feel like

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,480
they have enough time or monetary

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,510
resources to spend that time and when it

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,430
comes to that I would love to see more

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:39,180
and I see this happening gradually I

00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:42,150
would love to see more companies sponsor

00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:46,380
or reach out to those folks to sponsor

00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:52,590
to allow them to spend some more time I

00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:54,780
think as as someone who has previously

00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:58,140
been able to sort of offer sponsorship

00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,660
to folks it's also really helpful to

00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,710
know if people are in that position and

00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,660
so

00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,869
I think being public about you know I

00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,410
could I could I could do this thing but

00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:09,089
I can't

00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,010
for this reason especially if it is

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:12,359
money is really really helpful for

00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,520
companies in the word press space to

00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,920
know because a lot of times that's

00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,780
something that's that's important to

00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,670
those companies and important to to

00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,230
folks to help out with I don't know if

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:28,440
that helps it all and I think we need to

00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:30,450
ask the big company like GoDaddy just

00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,300
