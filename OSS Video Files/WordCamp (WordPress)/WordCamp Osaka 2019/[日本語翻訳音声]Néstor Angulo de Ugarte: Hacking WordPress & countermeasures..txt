Title: [日本語翻訳音声]Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: Hacking WordPress & countermeasures.
Publication date: 2020-02-19
Playlist: WordCamp Osaka 2019
Description: 
	The most 3 typical questions that people ask to me when they realize that I work in the cybersecurity field are:
– How to know if I’ve been hacked
– What to do when this (s**t) happens
– How I can avoid it.
By displaying a little horror gallery with some examples gathered during the years I’ve been working at Sucuri, I will show how a hacked site looks like, helping hopefully to train a little bit your eyes to know where to look at, and some tips to help to detect anomalies ASAP.
Once something bad is detected, there is a recommended checklist of countermeasures to fight against them and avoid future re-infections.
