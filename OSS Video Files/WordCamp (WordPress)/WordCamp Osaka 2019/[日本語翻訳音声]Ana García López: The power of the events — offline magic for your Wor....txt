Description: 
	Nowadays it seems that every Marketing strategy is focused on the online media. It may seem totally natural, when you run an online WordPress business. However, we should never underestimate the power of the offline connection between people. In the context of WordPress community events like WordCamps are a great opportunity both for personal learning and business growth. Events can help you learn new things and meet like-minded people, but they can also be a very important part of the marketing strategy for your WordPress business. In this talk I will guide you through the best practices of attending, sponsoring and organizing events, which are relevant to your business. I will share examples from my own experience with events and you will learn how they can be incorporated in your marketing strategy.
