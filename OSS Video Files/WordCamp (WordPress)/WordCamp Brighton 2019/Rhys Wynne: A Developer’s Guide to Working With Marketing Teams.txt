Title: Rhys Wynne: A Developer’s Guide to Working With Marketing Teams
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brighton 2019
Description: 
	As somebody who has been both a developer and marketing team leader in my career, I’ve been able to see when projects go wrong between developers and external or internal marketing teams.
In this talk, I’ll share a few areas on where relationships break down, how to avoid problems before they arise, and also tips to get marketing teams on your side so you can both serve a happy client.

give me room warm applause Rhys win

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,760
thank you very much sir my queen Rhys I

00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:18,520
am Rhys and I'm here today as Ben said

00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,590
to give a developer's guide to working

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,850
with marketing so as a very brief

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,710
introduction as Ben did so we

00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,210
wonderfully started with wordpress into

00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,949
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,810
I then worked as a search engine

00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:31,689
optimizer / WordPress developer for an

00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,750
agency based in North Wales until 2010 I

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:36,100
then moved to Manchester in 2010 to work

00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,500
as a pure digital marketer for a digital

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,480
marketing agency was there for two years

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,480
returns of WordPress development for a

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,280
marketing agency in 2012 and then I went

00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,190
to freelance about this time last year

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,379
so what does that mean well it means I'm

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,739
a developer who kind of knows a bit

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:54,910
about marketing and when I'm a developer

00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:56,500
who can knows a bit of our marketing

00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,879
kind of push you in a weird position so

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,280
there's like a there's a few big

00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,930
conferences Brighton SEO next month I go

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,080
to a few marketing conferences and I go

00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:07,450
there and I start speaking to people and

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,760
they look at me like how the aliens look

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:13,479
at the claw in the original Toy Story

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,700
because it's all like oh it's really

00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,250
really good and there are people who

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,259
introduced me and I go hey this is my

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,560
friend Rhys he's a developer who knows

00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:24,939
SEO and they go oh that's really really

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,439
good and eventually we start a

00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:28,270
conversation because eventually what

00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,890
happens is you end up with something

00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,450
looks a little bit like this because at

00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,430
least a conversation about previous

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,409
experience working with often really

00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,970
really good talented developers and the

00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:39,520
fact they've been burnt in the past and

00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,130
it sucks so and it's not necessarily bad

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,900
developers or bad marketers but bad

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,759
communication so by the end of this

00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,170
discussion you'll hopefully avail to

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,840
work on a team and achieve amazing

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,840
things like what Wales did in year 2016

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,189
no I have still not shut up about that

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,479
right so why should you do it well if

00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,759
you get them on your side they're great

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,500
people to know because they help a lot

00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,310
they're a great source of inspiration

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,649
and ideas you're going to be hearing all

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,079
over this week and some great talks from

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,629
developers all talk about some weird and

00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:15,640
cool stuff you can do in developments

00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,680
with like called new technologies having

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,310
a marketer on your side can help focus

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,110
those idea

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,210
give you really cool ideas and say oh

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,460
actually I can use for example react on

00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,530
this and it's really really cool or I

00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,330
can use like this really cool API to

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,350
achieve this goal for a marketer and

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,870
it's great because you get to play

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,180
around with all this stuff and they will

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:38,500
also go into bath for you a lot of

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,700
developers worked budgets and usually

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,920
the budget for the same as marketing

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,290
budgets and sometimes sometimes some of

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,000
those get cut so having a marketer go

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,680
into bath for you saying we really like

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,900
working with this developer it's a

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,989
really really cool thing plus what you

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,090
do seems like magic it's great it can be

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:59,050
easy to impress but it can be really

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:02,940
easy to frustrate them right I'm gonna

00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,940
find a better way to drink some water oh

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:12,190
these are great I've got a trip on that

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,190
so what a market is judged off marketers

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,830
are judged on KP ice now what are KPIs

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,870
key performance indicators when a

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,940
marketing strategy is produced there are

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,330
things it's called KPIs which is this is

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,360
what it is judged on so to judge the

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:36,160
success or the failure of a marketing

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,269
strategy is there's KP ice now there's

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,360
there usually things like sales

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,250
increased traffic increase rankings

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,560
improving they're not things on I love

00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,890
yolks for lows it's not things like the

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,049
traffic lighting Yoast that's a really

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,280
really good indicator but it's generally

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:56,860
not in marketing strategies find out

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,769
which ones you could control of the KPIs

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,350
and see if you can assist any now

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:05,290
they'll generally fall into strategies

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,510
that are on page changes so three

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,120
examples conversion rates so any

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,360
improvements to the user experience to

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,610
make a conversion easier rankings you

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,180
may not think rankings but google has

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:22,479
said that rankings can be improved with

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,590
improving the speed of the site so if

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,910
you improve the speed of your site you

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,820
may be able to improve rankings not

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,080
guarantee but you can do and

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,910
click-through rate so this is basically

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,400
people clicking on the site through

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,810
Google things like improving a site

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,550
architecture make sure the right

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,740
keywords are ranking for the right pages

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,200
are ranking for the right keywords that

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,760
can really help in search engines now

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,160
the problem is you won't be able to

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,380
control all of it so for example

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,860
conversion rate if the marketing agency

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,410
will do a poor pay-per-click campaign

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,300
conversion rate will tank if ranking if

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,210
the marketing team builds really dodgy

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,120
links the rankings will drop and the

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,310
click-through rate if the marketing team

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,050
prioritizes the incorrect page so I

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,690
guess what I'm trying to say is be aware

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:13,150
of them but don't be judged right

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,710
usually when you first get work with a

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,890
marketing agency you get what is known

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,630
as the list and the list is usually

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,920
producer to be beginning to project

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,510
everybody's friends with each other's

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,220
everybody's really really happy we've

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,020
got this great team together and the

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,850
marketing team will go off and they'll

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,170
produce this list of everything that's

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,870
wrong in this website that you've

00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,480
probably built and they just pick

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,920
through it and decided that there are

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,240
lots of problems and the use deal with

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,410
such vim and vigor it's really really

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,190
happy and there's really really excited

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:46,720
and then you get it and then go okay

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,840
because it's usually quite long and it's

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,120
usually quite detailed now what you need

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,640
to do when if you get the list is ask

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,750
for it to be prioritized and usually

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,250
they'll go away and they're really

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,390
really nice and they prioritize it for

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:06,190
you sometimes I'll go a wall of this

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:07,540
priority which is not great because if

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,180
all everything's a priority

00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,940
nothing is a priority so you may have to

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,250
prioritize it for him so to do that you

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,030
refer back to those three letters I talk

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,370
about KP ice so at this point it's very

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,840
useful to get access to the clients

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,250
Google Analytics and Google Webmaster

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,660
Tools access yeah you know to get access

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,669
to it because then you can start

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,140
prioritizing for them and making

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,410
suggestions so I'm going to use the

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,180
three examples of KPIs that you can

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,870
control and some thinking doing Google

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,120
Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:47,180
so for example to improve conversions if

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,770
you if the KPI system can improve

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,080
conversions if you go to Google

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,840
Analytics and go to behavior slide

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,180
content and landing pages if the

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,510
marketing agency has goals set up for

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,820
that client and they should you can view

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,889
conversion rates of landing pages I

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,870
don't if you can see it it's the top bar

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,949
it says goal set one and e-commerce I

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,990
don't know if you see it I'll share them

00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,330
slides after if you click on one of

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,310
those you can set goals into groups so

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,100
for example one once goal set could be

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,990
you know any sort of inquiry so things

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,820
like filling out the contact form

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,270
clicking on a phone number things like

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,860
that one could be did I sign up to the

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,950
social do they sign up to Twitter your

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,970
Facebook something newsletter and there

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,130
is also especially one which is

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,110
e-commerce which is have they do they

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,990
actually make a sale so you can kind of

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,320
group it by those goals so you click on

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,760
one of those you can see how much

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,889
traffic each page go how many sessions

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,919
they go and also the conversion rate so

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:50,270
the conversion rate for this goal set is

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,280
two point nine seven and a lot of the

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,979
most of it comes through one or two

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,599
pages so good idea is to prioritize Inc

00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,610
of who's improving the conversion rates

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,250
of pages that already have some

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,840
conversions but more importantly a high

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,539
number of sessions so for example in

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,550
this example you can't really see here

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:09,500
one page has a hundred percent

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,940
conversion rate but there's only three

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,430
visitors to it so I'm not probably going

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,440
to be worried too much about it the one

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,030
below which I haven't got you can't if

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,530
you see the conversion rate on but it

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:24,289
has 210 sessions so that would be a good

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,690
good use of my time is to focus on that

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,160
page

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,650
improving rankings similarly in Google

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,589
Analytics look at pages are getting a

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,680
lot of traffic and go to behavior site

00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:38,839
speed and speed suggestions you can then

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,630
filter it further so for example you can

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,240
filter by organic traffic or way you

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,380
should filter on organic traffic so only

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,420
traffic that comes from search engines

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,560
because that's the traffic that is

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,630
ranking and that's the traffic that

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,980
matters

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:56,100
you can also filter by device so mobile

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,350
and then there's a link for Page Speed

00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,399
suggestions if you click on that link

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,050
it'll give you some page brief

00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,510
suggestions now I don't like clicking on

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,610
that link I prefer to get the URL which

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,279
is in the left-hand column and put it

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,270
into something like Google Page beetle

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:14,610
or Google lighthouse or GT matrix but

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,610
I'm going to talk about it from the page

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:21,330
beetle because lighthouse is pretty

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,950
similar you run lighthouse locally

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,209
rather than PageSpeed insight which runs

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,260
online because you can do things like

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:30,720
throttle traffic so put the URL of your

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,270
chosen page into this page and then

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,120
click on analyze what then happens is it

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,160
analyzes the page speed and it will give

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,480
you some really useful things first of

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,170
all it'll give you a score which you can

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,959
actually see here

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:47,100
ignore the score it's it's an arbitrary

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,140
number look at things like the speed it

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,040
takes to time to interactive which is

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:57,120
how long it takes for the user to be

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,980
able to interact with set page but

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,529
what's really useful is that it will

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,810
also give you suggestions in page speed

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:06,029
now it gives you things like suggestions

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,839
focused on WordPress so for example on

00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:12,390
this page two point two seconds was

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,720
loading javascript and CSS on this page

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:18,300
that not necessarily needed to be loaded

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,430
so what is suggested is like saying

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,440
write split the JavaScript and CSS into

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,690
two separate files load the important

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,010
stuff at the top load the stuff we don't

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,050
need until later in the page at the

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,820
bottom and here's a list of WordPress

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,320
plugins that can do it for you

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:36,380
that's really really useful okay next up

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,360
the final one was the click-through rate

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:42,420
in google webmaster tools this is click

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,300
on webmaster tools and performance get a

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,770
page URL so any page which has a lot of

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:52,110
traffic from Google Analytics and make

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,240
sure you filter it by that page so your

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,850
only show traffic full set page and then

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,260
filter by click through ratio ascending

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:03,660
so all these phrases for my page get 0

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,000
which is probably about example but you

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,450
these are all pages to go to the home

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,850
page

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:12,240
and see if there's more relevant keyword

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,900
to rank full set page so for example on

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,060
my personal site I have a maintenance

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,950
like a maintenance package page for

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,310
WordPress so update plugins and things

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:26,850
like that when the home page ranks the

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:32,940
click through ratio from Google dropped

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:34,470
really really quickly if the dedicated

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,540
page ranks the click through ratio

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,640
increases quite a lot so see if there's

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,380
a more relevant page to rank for certain

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,610
keywords so for example this is actually

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,740
the home page the second example

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,330
WordPress maintenance packages guess

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,370
click through ratio 0 and it's to the

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,440
home page so chances are I want to focus

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,510
on that keyword to go to the proper

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,220
maintenance package page so therefore it

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,910
ranks better and more people will click

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,620
for it

00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:00,120
you know it's more relevant search

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:02,970
results it is quite a long processes so

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,410
you probably only want to you know do it

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,480
for a couple of keywords for example one

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,490
of the keywords their SEO freelancer

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,350
Manchester I ran for don't care about

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,330
that because I don't offer SEO so don't

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:16,130
focus on that but focus on keywords that

00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:18,570
you can rank on if all else fails

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,980
estimating and cost for each task this

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,470
is a really really good useful way to

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,780
kind of focus minds because once you

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,810
come to them with a bill they generally

00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:31,440
say what's important and what isn't

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:33,750
right number three soft skills this is

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,880
becoming more and more important so soft

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,320
skills is the ability to communicate and

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,750
things like that

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,830
communication speaking to marketers can

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,110
make the difference between a good

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,340
experience and a bad experience so it's

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,450
a very very important skill and it's

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,650
beginning to get more focus in a

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,770
wordpress community which is great

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,150
superb this is something that happened

00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:54,090
about three you know four or five years

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,100
ago I used to come to WordPress

00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,830
conferences and when it comes and

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,720
meetups and I somebody would speak to me

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,790
about SEO and they and then somebody

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,770
else would interject and go all you need

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:08,940
to do is write your content and you or

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:10,170
rank no no that's not true it was really

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,890
frustrating because it's almost like

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:17,490
saying if you run really really fast you

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,890
can win the Olympic gold it's true you

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,100
can be kind of missing everything in the

00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,519
mail

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,420
also trying to voice a that luckily this

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,480
is this is dying so it's great

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:32,670
next up avoid micromanaging it's

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,589
annoying you hate it I hate it and

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:39,240
everybody hates it right micromanaging

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:42,259
this comes in two forms micromanaging

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,910
the client I'm micromanaging yourself

00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:47,009
regarding micromanaging myself I kind of

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,889
give like twice daily updates to my

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,839
clients at the absolute most or the

00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:54,000
exception of one client who demands

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,860
three that apart from that everybody

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,470
else kind of it's like twice daily

00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,699
updates just hey it's lunchtime here's

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,230
what I've been doing this morning or hey

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:04,610
and it's usually something in a sack

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,610
message it's not even like an email

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,899
micromanaging the client if something is

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,490
going to change on the site the make

00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,459
them aware of it as soon as you think is

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:18,509
going to change don't wait until you

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:20,699
actually need it and you know and then

00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:21,839
you begin chasing every hour and it just

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:23,819
becomes really really frustrating

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,639
because those chances are there's

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:30,449
nothing they can do a couple of example

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,819
example recently we did a non WordPress

00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:34,769
- WordPress site conversion as soon as

00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,519
it became obvious that the URL structure

00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,439
had to change

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,060
we told the marketing team because it

00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:40,620
was just like this is not going to work

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,660
with him WordPress I mean I actually

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,779
didn't know this but we were supposed to

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,519
be changing it anyway but grateful

00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,290
because then they could prepare a bunch

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
of redirects and go right okay we want

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,670
this page to get to here this page goes

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,769
here here's a list here's the CSV you

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,740
can run with it and it's great I also

00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,329
like saying right I need this it's not a

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,189
blocker right now but if you get it

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:05,689
sorted that will be great

00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:05,689
that's another thing that kind of thing

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:12,269
ask why and explain why what do I mean

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,490
by this if a request is made do you

00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:15,079
don't necessarily agree with and it

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,750
happens

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:21,870
rather than saying no ask why needs to

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,180
be done because either one of three

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,980
things will happen you can either get

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,559
some insta understanding on why it needs

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,750
to be done which is great because then

00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:37,569
you can you know put it in

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:41,259
you can buy them as explaining why needs

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:44,529
to be done they may realize it's a good

00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:47,529
idea it's not a good idea so that kind

00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,879
of you know it kind of focuses them and

00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,579
kind of go actually not really that

00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,910
important or they explain why and you

00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:57,189
still disagree if that happens then you

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,310
explain why it's a bad idea to them

00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:04,060
don't just say computer says no because

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:06,240
it really really isn't helpful generally

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,519
what's often perceived in our world

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,920
outside our world as a 10-minute job

00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,899
isn't a 10-minute job and another

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,899
example I had recently on a project a

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:20,379
client wanted to change all the ID

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:23,199
numbers on a wordpress site like all the

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,519
post IDs because we were getting there

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,420
was quite a lot of post types and one

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:30,730
post type in particular was kind of

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,279
pushing to like 10,000 15,000 and there

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,110
was just like we kind of want smaller

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,850
numbers and it's like actually what you

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,959
think maybe a quick job actually isn't

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:46,480
so yeah we found a solution for that

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:48,160
next up don't assume knowledge I do this

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,589
talk to marketers but the other way

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,509
around and there's a slide in there

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:55,269
where I said the worst three words that

00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:59,259
a marketer can say to a developer is can

00:16:55,269 --> 00:17:02,410
you just the worst three words for a

00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:06,789
developer to say to a marketer is can't

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,409
you just it can be dangerous to assume

00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:11,110
knowledge it's a very very difficult

00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:14,289
skill and I have been guilty of it I've

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,360
been guilty of this this weekend it just

00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:17,589
can come across quite frustrating it

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,220
comes across as lazy now the other side

00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:23,559
is you over explained things I kind of

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,209
think that's a better thing then

00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,829
assuming knowledge because then you just

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,250
kind of I just find it really

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,510
frustrating and everybody's kind of

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,309
working off different knowledge levels

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,760
I've been freelancing for a year it's

00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:37,090
going great

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,919
I know very little about SSH tunnel

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,580
association to a server it'll always go

00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,260
struggling and I'll get that right now

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,370
an example I gave recently this was for

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,790
a clients and what we were doing

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,430
was we were creating new theme for the

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,470
clients but we had to use some theme

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,390
some for your files from the old theme I

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,290
sent an email said can you send over the

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,090
old thing

00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,530
they immediately fired back and said

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,000
can't you just download it from the

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,860
server

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,420
I can fairly straightforward thing to do

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,970
the problem is I didn't have FTP access

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,890
I didn't have SSH access I didn't have

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,220
any sort of access at all

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:18,040
I also they had this weird kind of get

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,500
versioning system on the server and so

00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,250
you had to go to like a really long

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,650
folder and it was really really

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,600
difficult what would have been a two

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,350
minute job for them actually turned out

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,220
to be about two hours for me and it was

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:36,429
just really really hard okay next point

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:40,480
is the relationship between the clients

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:42,910
the marketers and developers offered to

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,920
be liaison this is a win-win-win

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:52,270
situation if you speak to somebody on

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,410
behalf of clients you can help make you

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,010
know the relationship better

00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,059
so benefits you because it saves time it

00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,650
also makes you a little bit

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:01,390
indispensable which is superb because

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,630
marketing but you know budgets get

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,610
changed it benefits the client because

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,050
things get fixed a bit quicker the

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,740
benefits of marketing agency because

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:13,750
there's less responsibility for them so

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,030
who should liaise with well three good

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,420
examples any sort of in-house developers

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,890
the client may have any designers they

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,360
could be you could be working with on a

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,679
project because if you're going to be

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,750
building a theme that somebody else is

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,309
designing you kind of want to you know

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,720
we didn't want you know you want it in a

00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,150
format you can understand so you may

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,520
want to speak directly to them and

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,470
hosting companies as well although

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,450
reputable hosting companies will not

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,720
speak you have to kind of go through

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,240
your clients first of all to make sure

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,690
that you can speak to them it may not

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,750
always be possible this due to NDA's and

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:54,010
whatever but it's kind of if you can

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:56,620
it's a good thing to do agree to

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,870
boundaries every single project the kind

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,670
of goes wrong at some point

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:05,830
boundaries have been crossed I worked

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,800
this is in a previous job now I worked

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:13,330
with a marketing a an in-house marketer

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:16,230
for a client and literally she was

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:19,180
saying they would send an email and

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,640
within 45 minutes I would receive a

00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:24,670
phone call saying why is this not being

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,190
done the problem was we didn't agree to

00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,450
boundaries at the time at the start and

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,280
as soon as I got the phone call I

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,470
neither became defensive and negative

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:36,370
because chances are didn't redeem it's

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,990
45 minutes if you agree to boundary

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,360
before working with people then you can

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,270
kind of you know not necessarily hide

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:48,760
behind them but it puts you less as a

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:52,540
defense of a negative point so I try and

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,370
I try and you know try and agree to

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,000
boundaries beforehand and slis and

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,780
things like that

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,280
so that's a really good thing to do have

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,650
one point of contact as well

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:06,400
problems arises with more than one

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:09,100
contact on both sides especially if

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,780
you're following a process for you know

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,760
bug reports and things like that if you

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,130
have one person who can kind of

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,210
prioritize it on their end and one

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,410
person who prioritizes a you'll rent it

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,170
just makes life a lot easier

00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,940
usually if you're a freelancer obviously

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,620
it'll be yourself but if you're in an

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,990
agency they'll try and get a project

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:34,480
manager involved and the final point is

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,980
documents everything you change very

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,300
important if you document it somewhere

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,320
even an email or a git repository as

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,240
long as you document every single

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,890
changes great one of the cool things you

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,840
can also do with Google Analytics is you

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,340
can annotate in Google Analytics so if

00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,040
you put a new version of a theme up and

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,650
the rankings tanked

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,210
you can see that this is where half and

00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,650
kind of things so you can begin to idea

00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,650
of how to put things right and things

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:02,350
like that right what to do when things

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:06,070
go wrong because everything invariably

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:08,380
does try not to be confrontational that

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,090
really doesn't help don't try and blame

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,890
people don't try and blame them

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,470
especially in front of a client that's

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,590
really really

00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:17,000
helpful use documentation to refer

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,400
decisions made and why things are done

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,780
when you're writing documentation at the

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,000
time and if you documents it if your

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,909
document things when decisions are made

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,940
you generally write it in a more neutral

00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:31,520
more kind of calm language because

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,610
whatever has gone wrong hasn't gone

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,520
wrong yet so if you if you refer back to

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,049
the documentation you could kind of go

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,580
okay this is why it was done and it's

00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:43,630
not usually and nobody's really blamed

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:46,309
for it so it's a really good thing to do

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,650
I've hidden behind the agreements at

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,840
times not always the most intelligent

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,039
things but sometimes when things go

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,470
really really wrong you can kind of go

00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,679
along you know it's the week and I can't

00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,179
really look at this right now not always

00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,659
smart and this is one begin things begin

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:02,570
to go wrong

00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:04,400
and when things get to the point of you

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,750
know what this is not going to work it's

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,799
far better just to come to an agreement

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:11,659
for EXCI if the worst comes to worst if

00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,150
you come to an agreement for exit then

00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:17,900
you can kind of say right this is where

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,850
our agreements end the worst thing you

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,140
can do is to go to the client and go

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,390
some marketing agency because of

00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,340
variably you'll get an email four or

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,860
five months down the line and people

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,600
asking where you are so don't try and do

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,030
that if something's not working just

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,789
come to an agreement for an ACCI I mean

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,590
go from there don't wonder end of a

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,510
sudden oh so what to do when things go

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:42,500
right because projects do go right is

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,970
wonderful recommend of if they're if

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,919
you've been working with a external

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:49,340
marketing agency recommend them to

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,260
people I have three that I will happily

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,820
recommend if anybody's about the agency

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,350
to work with one of which will work with

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,030
massive budgets one of which would work

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,730
with slightly smaller one and a

00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:02,600
freelancer kind of thing the cool thing

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:05,179
about that is if they if everything goes

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,710
well for you as a developer if you work

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:08,720
with the external marketing agency that

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:13,070
then they'll probably work with you on

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:16,809
this project which is great keep an eye

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,650
on the team wherever they go on LinkedIn

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:20,210
especially for team members you enjoy

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,090
working with because people move on

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,649
people change jobs they could work in

00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,960
another marketing agency that could be

00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:27,970
even though it's differ

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,110
I usually to one you recommended if

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,510
you're working with the same team

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,860
members that's a superb thing there are

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:35,260
a couple of marketers I've worked with

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,580
in four different jobs that's just the

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,440
way it is because we just kind of end up

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,559
in the same place and people recommend

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,049
each other it's great and if you become

00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:46,000
really friendly with them ask them for

00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:48,130
opinions on your own sites usually you

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,380
know coffee or a beard there a lot of

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,380
marketers like giving their opinions on

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,580
things usually for the price of a coffee

00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,789
and a beer which is a lot cheaper than

00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,190
what they usually cost so the aquavalve

00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:08,649
thank you very much and I'm some

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:10,990
questions hello good stuff

00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:11,980
wonderful talk race so if anyone's got

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,630
any questions we've got a microphone

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,929
that's kicking about hands up in the air

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,929
there we go just for the back there

00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:22,149

person okay now marketer right and and I

00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,690
thought there's like a really

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,740
interesting insight and one of the

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,090
things that kind of came up I was

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,240
thinking about as I was watching your

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,919
talk was and what can marketers take

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,750
responsibility for a little bit more

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,970
because I've been there an agency where

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,130
they've got developers to do everything

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,539
like even redirects and can you add a

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,590
new suck because we're talking about SEO

00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:46,270
specifically here

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,710
can you add a new site map and these are

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,000
things that with a little bit of

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,960
training marketers could do potentially

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,299
right yeah it's a tricky one ie

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,720
so my kind of rule is that anything that

00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:00,669
is technical I would probably like to do

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,409
so even things like I mean redirects are

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,539
an interesting one because in WordPress

00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:06,070
you can you know there are plugins like

00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:09,070
301 redirects and things like that

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,679
ie like using them but the problem is is

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,350
like for me and again mileage may vary

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,730
for me I prefer all redirects to be in

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,559
one place and I usually put them in my

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:21,159
hasty access things like that which is a

00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:22,630
little bit more technical thing you can

00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,510
kind of do if you prepare like a

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,039
redirect file which is just a CSV any

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,130
competent developer should be able to

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,960
just like turn that into like a you know

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,049
something they can put in a hasty access

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,299
file anything which is preparing and the

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:40,190
other thing is don't leave things open

00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:42,620
to interpretation I

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:46,520
kind of say to clients look send me the

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:49,670
URL don't send me you know go to this

00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:53,390
page because as a developer I have you

00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,860
know hopefully quite a lot of clients so

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,870
so anything that you don't leave

00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,610
anything opens a chance because if you

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:02,930
leave it opens a chance things will take

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:05,000
longer to get done because you know I

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,120
not be an email back and forth or made

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,620
it to the wrong page anything like you

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,300
know page titles anything you can

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,800
anything with a wordpress plug-in like

00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,060
your Yoast WordPress SEO the - to a

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,120
degree probably not redirects but

00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,090
anything you can do to kind of help

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:33,710
those kind of things are kind of useful

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:36,020
it doesn't okay so obviously agencies

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,310
all have their own project management

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,760
styles and they all have their own

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:42,470
project management tooling yeah and you

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,450
litter between the various different

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,040
companies so presumably you have your

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,440
own internal project management style

00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,510
and tooling how do you sort of marry the

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,310
two so that they don't start separating

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,050
and people think that you're further

00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:59,690
along in one process because it says so

00:27:54,050 --> 00:28:04,790
in there the internal ones that I use so

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:07,580
my project management is I have Trello

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,650
boards and things I buy whatever the

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,650
client uses that's the one that I will

00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,270
probably focus on the Trello pause is

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,630
there to kind of manage a day to day and

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,880
it's I don't I don't want to share it up

00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:22,160
because it works for me and it is quite

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,420
a it's it's kind of complex but you know

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,260
it's this one of those things that kind

00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,670
of just works so I always try if if the

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,280
client says you know for example use

00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:33,620
asana or use Monday comm I will be using

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,470
whatever they whatever they choose to

00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,830
work on sometimes they have there's a

00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:42,410
separate one between the client and the

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:45,050
marketer so I only and the client

00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:48,290
doesn't know that I'm working on the

00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:50,120
project at all as a freelancer so that

00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,710
can also be that so whatever whatever

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,690
the ease of the marketing agency old

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,630
gathering the marketing agency

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,220
whatever the marketing agency works on

00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:04,840
that's the one I'll I will be focused on

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:04,840
and I have my own internal tools myself

00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:12,500
any more questions folks cool good stuff

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,400
