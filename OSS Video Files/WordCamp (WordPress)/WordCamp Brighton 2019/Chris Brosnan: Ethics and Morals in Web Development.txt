Title: Chris Brosnan: Ethics and Morals in Web Development
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brighton 2019
Description: 
	How can we ensure that we adapt the same standards of fairness, openness and inclusion at the heart of the WordPress community into our day-to-day web development projects?
How can we not only support but be champions of the open-source ethos of WordPress to clients and stakeholders?
Has the nature of building web applications evolved so much that we must now consider the possibility of an ethical and moral code by which we scope for and build web applications, particularly for WordPress sites?
I will attempt to (briefly) answer some of these questions, give my own thoughts on this and highlight some of the possible things that we need to consider beyond web performance, UX/UI, loading times and code quality.
No matter what the project is, we have certain moral and ethical issues around equality, fairness and inclusion that need to be considered more so now than ever before.

I'm really looking forward to this one

00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:14,950
please make you feel about very welcome

00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:17,410
Chris Potanin okay so yeah thanks

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,410
everyone for coming here so when we talk

00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,519
about ethics and morals in web

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,590
development obviously we see them in

00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,830
other professions that we see them in a

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,349
medical profession in law and so on I

00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,599
feel like our web development and the

00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:34,420
digital sector as a whole is growing now

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,850
so we need to start thinking about these

00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:41,969
questions particularly with how software

00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:44,079
including websites is changing so I

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,329
slightly touched here but why do we talk

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,120
about ethics and morals in went or why

00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:52,359
should we well first of all we work with

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,539
all kinds of people and large variety

00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:59,350
people as clients stakeholders as

00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:03,059
colleagues peers and users and within

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:07,540
those groups we find so many variations

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,880
and good websites in my opinion are

00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:14,020
those which are not only created well

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,880
for performance and code quality but

00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:25,390
also are accessible and have an ease of

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:26,650
use and can be adapted so before we get

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,299
into what this might mean for

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,049
development what are the differences

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:33,100
between morals ethics and law morals and

00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:35,829
ethics are often used interchangeably

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,799
but they are very different and this is

00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,840
not just a philosophical argument it's

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,799
actually fact that there is a difference

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,479
between them so morals are what you hold

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,820
yourself to be right and wrong

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,619
personally so that's a lot that could be

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,299
down to your religion or religious

00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:55,299
upbringing it could be a result of

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:59,439
cultural norms or it could be parental

00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:02,049
influence or so on it's not so clear

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,689
fact it's something that's dictated by

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,710
you personally ethics on the other hand

00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:12,280
usually have more of a professional

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,260
context so for example the medical

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,170
profession has its own ethics law has

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,520
its own ethics and teaching does so this

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,880
is largely professional

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,190
and rules and so what you may see in

00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,300
academia for example or in other

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:30,910
professions law very simply we all know

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,200
this just very clear-cut regulations we

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,510
have sanctions for not following those

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:40,720
rules so it's more societal rather than

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:42,370
something professional or moral and

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,070
they're not always in sync with one

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:48,970
another as we'll find when we think

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:51,940
about gdpr and such it may not be always

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,810
in sync with these concept concepts may

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,610
not always be in sync with one another

00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:00,090
so for example if we were to take one of

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,570
these examples or two rather

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,940
experimentation on animals for

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,920
pharmaceutical research depending on

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,520
methods used it could be regarded as

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,570
ethical but too many may not be regarded

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,880
as moral and on the last example

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,920
well same-sex marriage is still illegal

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,290
in many countries in fact homosexuality

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,320
is still illegal in many countries but

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,060
as we saw in the UK in the before its

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,790
legalization we thought there was a lot

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,080
of public support for that so we see it

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:35,200
sometimes legal the law may not always

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,930
be entirely on the side of morality or

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:43,450
in all cases so this is why these things

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,830
are not so clear-cut and to write down

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,720
why is this related to software

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,070
development it may seem to you guys that

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,740
it's going off on a bit of a tangent but

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,540
it's now he's going back to the main

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:57,580
topic at hand so it's related because of

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,950
accessibility data collection and

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:04,150
storage any cultural sensitivity in the

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,920
software that we build translations and

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,260
to this I would say not only linguistic

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,470
translations but also localization of

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,209
the translation ensuring it translates

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,220
well to particular communities where

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,590
you're translating for a user-generated

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,859
content and in more recent years

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:23,230
artificial intelligence I'm sure you

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:25,870
guys can probably think of more examples

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,320
of how certain questions that come into

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:31,220
play when as developers we have contract

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:37,270
law is an example of Uruk

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,270
which which is a fault of quite often I

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,630
would say taking all of those things

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,880
into context why should we talk about

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,289
this in relation to web and software

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,620
development well first and foremost

00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:51,169
software is a huge part of virtually

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,080
everybody's life whether they believe it

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:56,330
or not in terms of mobile apps in terms

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,919
of websites which as far as I'm

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,800
concerned websites are just now a form

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,419
of software and any desktop applications

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,180
they use in professionally or personally

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:08,120
or so on and this is used around the

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,060
whole world and we see that users take

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,940
all are of all shapes sizes Creed's and

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,160
nationalities and so on so it's

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,630
important to ask certain questions when

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,099
we are adapting software for new

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:24,680
audiences or when we're building it for

00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:26,750
everybody and more prominently recent

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,910
scandals in the tech sector have shed

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,099
some light on some ethical questions

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,449
particular around data capturing and

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:38,210
security and there's a social networking

00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:40,729
sites we see problems with mental health

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:45,169
awareness or problems with mental health

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:46,669
of users and artificial intelligence and

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:50,210
big data is still in the very early

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:52,909
stages obviously there is AI out there

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:56,240
but it's still pretty rudimentary we're

00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:58,460
not yet at the stage where it's where

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,630
it's really complex but we probably are

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,919
at the stage now where we have to start

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,780
asking questions about where it goes

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:08,060
later on the open source ethos to me is

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,400
has more potential than just sharing

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,630
code and more potential than just being

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,169
part of a community of developers

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,699
working on project collaboratively which

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:19,690
we have seen in the real world we've

00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:22,550
seen you know board games and

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:26,090
professional bodies that have a open

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,990
source ethos we've seen other sorts of

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,550
media that have an open source efis so I

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,520
think particularly word camps are like

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:39,849
the open source if boss brought to life

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:43,070
into a physical real world event so and

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:44,480
building software but all these touches

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,730
on that is that building its

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,740
or now it's more than just writing code

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,780
and more than just writing good quality

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,660
code we actually need to ask about

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,430
usability and how it adapts to people

00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:01,250
with different levels of tech literacy

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:03,320
and so on and there is very real dangers

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:07,220
of poorly moderated user-generated

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,950
content so whether within your

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,480
application the content is if users

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,980
upload their own content as in any

00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,170
social network we have use generate

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:18,740
content but even in terms of comments on

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,810
blog posts or so on there's certain

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,470
questions to be asked about if you

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:27,350
completely automate these comments for

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,470
example on let's take a very large

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,860
wordpress blog for example do you

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:37,820
automate a lot of these comments on

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,250
these posts or do you have them manually

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,580
done or is it mix of the two

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,990
so yeah in a wordpress blog it may not

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,460
be as prominent but particularly in

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,620
social things with social network

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,360
insides you find that these questions

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:57,490
are much more pertinent now if we were

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:01,700
to take the moral and ethical concerns

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:04,510
they fall into four camps mostly so

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,060
accessibility data collection and

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,580
tracking and the use of that information

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,730
so not only how you store it and track

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,470
it but also how you use it oh I use your

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,290
company saying that selling it to a

00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:21,200
third party is your company using it to

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,720
deliberately market very specific

00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,400
advertisements to people and I would go

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,040
as far as say it's also the methods that

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,310
you use he probably to think about and

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,790
any cultural sensitivity so if if you

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,780
are marketing if your website is or

00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:39,530
application or whatnot is being catered

00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:44,030
to people not just in the UK or not just

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:46,280
in the Anglosphere you need to think

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,930
about not only first of all about

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,570
translating the content yeah first of

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,550
all do not assume that everybody using

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,620
your site knows how to speak or read

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,700
English particularly if you are

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,190
marketing it beyond the UK

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,710
and aside from that also think about not

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,750
only the translation but actually how

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,170
that translates culturally to the market

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,640
that you're aiming this towards so maybe

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,440
you have a different version of a site

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,510
for particular audiences and also the

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,510
moderation of user-generated content for

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,820
obvious reasons this does vary some

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,610
questions you know do we for example

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,550
with a political content on social

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,320
networks do we automate that moderation

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,790
or do we have it done manually and what

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,400
are the problems with iver legal

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,050
concerns we know these I'm not going to

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,940
know much

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,700
first of all accessibility there are

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,330
laws particularly around public sector

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,180
websites for accessibility a data

00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:54,720
collection security user-generated

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:56,580
content and contract law you know I'm

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,060
going now this the trolley problem is

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:05,010
something in sort of an ethics exercise

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:08,280
where essentially the your presentable

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,950
scenario that a train is on a runaway

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,520
track about to about to kill five people

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:16,650
that you have the power to pull the

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,910
lever and send it in the other direction

00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:22,350
towards one person so you might be

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,550
thinking what has this got to do with

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,500
code now think about this way so if

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,360
you're about if you are across roads of

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,550
deciding what framework to use for

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,310
something or how to approach a certain

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:41,820
problem with features in your site or if

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,470
you're looking at how to or even what

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:48,690
sort of development process you use

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:51,770
within your company think how would what

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,210
benefits would the pathway taking have

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,930
compared to going the other way and what

00:10:54,210 --> 00:11:01,500
potential benefits or shortcomings would

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:05,760
that have so I suppose in terms of for

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,160
usability you may find that suppose you

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,579
need to deliver a site very quickly and

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,399
you take certain shortcuts

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:18,809
and you deliver the features very

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:23,009
quickly you perhaps use some third-party

00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:26,040
plugins to deliver that but then you

00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:28,470
find that perhaps it's not been updated

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,410
in a while there are certain potential

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,920
security flaws in there but then on the

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:38,519
other hand you would need to take a much

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,110
longer time to do that project and it

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,600
could be much more expense for the

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,970
client or so on that's a very basic

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,939
example there are others out there

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,399
around you could think about

00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:57,089
translations or accessibility and what

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:58,379
may be some questions around that so I'm

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,319
going to go through some points how you

00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,860
could be morally and ethically sound as

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:07,709
a tech professional in my view this is

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,699
something that it obviously everyone

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,369
would have their own thoughts on it and

00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:14,249
everyone would have their own opinions

00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:16,319
I've I've led development teams and

00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:17,699
we're try to I try to think about rather

00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:20,100
than just the code and having good

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:22,199
quality I try and think what beyond that

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,850
so is there what does it mean for the

00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,230
user and what does it mean in terms of

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,850
the project as a whole

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:31,799
so when I think about accessibility

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,689
first and foremost I don't think about

00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,929
just in terms of building websites for

00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:39,540
visually and auditory impaired

00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:42,990
individuals I also think of this around

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,490
any language barriers so translations

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,350
comes into this if you're marketing

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,369
towards a non-speaking audience sorry

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:53,959
nan speak English speaking audience and

00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:56,339
any different levels of tech literacy

00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,259
I'm probably quite guilty this

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:02,069
particular early on in my career where I

00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:05,160
would build an application or a website

00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:08,579
and because I knew how it worked I

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,759
tended to forget that not everybody had

00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,259
the same ability so I had to go back and

00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,199
rewrite it and make it more simplified

00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,809
so I think actually trying to empathize

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:20,579
a little bit with as many different

00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:23,129
users as possible and actually when

00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,930
you're building features think well will

00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:25,250
somebody

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,890
have to go through more steps than

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,510
necessary to achieve this task or if

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,250
you're building a wordpress site for a

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,600
client in order to make some changes

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,770
would they need to do more steps than

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,320
necessary and ease-of-use generally and

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,480
restriction of access where needed so it

00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,680
should be easy to use generally but then

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,779
you need to make sure that there's

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:49,910
adequate restriction of access where

00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:52,100
necessary you of secondly I'd say use

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,630
good modern standards in your code and

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,820
comment wisely so just show hands how

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:05,120
many of us could admit that we've

00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:07,550
written bad code right and how many of

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,709
you have written code that you then went

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:16,459
back to later on and could not

00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:18,350
understand it yeah so so first of all

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,750
for that reason obviously it's I learned

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,110
this as well and I'm feeling being

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,250
honest I'm still guilty of it I still

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:29,480
write code that I later cannot

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,500
understand or I still write code where I

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,120
perhaps haven't written it in the best

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,650
way possible but I strongly believe

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,959
writing good code has not only

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,089
performance benefits but it also shows

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,520
consideration for potential colleagues

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,650
who you're working with so if you're

00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,089
going to write code do not assume you're

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,950
the only person who's going to be

00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,410
working on that because the chances are

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,029
someone else will learn later time and I

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,130
think it shows good consideration to

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,260
comment adequately I mean not not huge

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,630
blocks of comments there it's like a

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:03,440
paragraph but just having it adequately

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:07,430
so it's can be picked up by another

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,339
individual and where I say modern

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:13,790
standards that's simply building code

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:17,510
that can that is future proof and can be

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:20,230
adapted over time so personally I when

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:24,579
we write in PHP I try not to use so much

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:27,370
procedural and I try to go more down the

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:34,339
object-oriented or MVC route if possible

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:36,509
so that's on that and test your code

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,179
thoroughly so

00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:43,410
this is where the sort of ethics comes

00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:44,339
into it so all the software has bugs we

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,399
all know this Oh

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,549
all software has bugs and you will never

00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,600
be able to eliminate them fully but you

00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:55,619
can at least minimize the chance of them

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,290
causing a huge issue or at least

00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:59,579
minimize the chance of them popping up

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,040
it will always come up at some point

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:05,819
because you can't be sure how the user

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,709
might use your website in a very strange

00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:09,629
way and they might uncover something you

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,790
didn't know of but it's important to

00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:14,730
test very thoroughly because usually

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:17,579
bugs are very harmless and at most

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,309
they're just a mild inconvenience but

00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:23,549
there are cases where they can be much

00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:27,059
more in rare cases they have caused

00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:29,609
death in certain applications and

00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:32,819
certain software's so the two examples I

00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:35,279
give here much older but these things do

00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:39,919
still occur so the NORAD missile

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,600
detection system that was it was a US

00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,989
missile detection system in during the

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,759
Cold War and it actually did have error

00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:50,459
at some point that was caused by a bug

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,169
in the coding and it showed that a

00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:57,509
missile was actually heading for them so

00:16:54,169 --> 00:17:01,109
at that time it very came very close to

00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:03,329
causing a nuclear war and the only

00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:07,709
reason it actually did not happen is

00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:10,380
because one of the lead programmers on

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,209
that project actually fought back and

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,360
realized that it's probably just a

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,699
glitch in the system and then it was

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,250
proven to be so so it was averted but

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:24,779
that could have very easily gone wrong

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:27,500
now a case where it did go wrong in with

00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:30,389
farik 25 I believe there's some

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,860
radiation therapy for cancer treatments

00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:37,860
in the 80s so essentially the software

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,490
that would create a dose for those

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:44,100
patients had bug in it and it meant that

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,460
many patients would get in up to a

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:51,860
hundred times the recommended dose and

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:54,350
there were at least three deaths but

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,820
obviously in the medical sector the

00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:00,530
software is probably a lot more likely

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:03,520
to cause problems but if you take it in

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,350
terms of a domino effect maybe your

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,780
software if it's not correctly tested

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,880
four key things it could have a domino

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,020
effect and cause problems later on so

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,309
it's important to ask these things about

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,070
when you're even when you're building a

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:19,340
wordpress site so you go if this is

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,080
their sensitive data on here if some bug

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:29,260
led to it being breached what could be

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:32,270
the potential fallout of that and and

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,520
following on from that think of security

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:38,960
concerns in your coding so think as any

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,240
potential hacker would the first one

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,530
you'd be surprised how many times that

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,160
does happen if you're putting your code

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:54,400
on github or any git repo even if it's

00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:57,320
under a private repo don't store

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,570
passwords within say your WP config file

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,440
or within seeing a laravel project

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:07,370
within the dot env file because even if

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:11,360
it's under a private repo that could be

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,860
passed on at a later time so if you do

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,530
have those files in there I'll take any

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,400
sensitive code with it within those

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:21,080
files replace it with placeholders and

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,090
say on your production site run a script

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:28,400
to replace that with the real values

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:31,640
also if if your application stores user

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,800
data admit this until recently this is

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,720
something I wasn't always doing but if

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:40,070
it stores user data when working in the

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,870
development environment I would say

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:49,340
don't use real data use test or dummy

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:52,940
data if necessary so if that means on

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:56,030
your development site you have a test

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,940
WordPress user accounts and test user

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:02,490
data or so on then so via it can be

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,950
replaced in production

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,810
but obviously you don't know where that

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,290
data could end up if particularly if

00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:13,440
it's sensitive and test for security

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:16,950
exploits if the budget allows hire a

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,450
specialist and pen test it yeah

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,840
obviously not all teams would have the

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:28,260
budget for that and if not then just

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,490
test as fairly as possible and I touched

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,540
on this area so write your code as

00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,790
though you're writing it for somebody

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,950
else to read because the chances are

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:38,340
someone else will read it and have to

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,360
work on it at some point why I can think

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,690
of the number times where I've been

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,310
working on a small little plugin or so

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,960
on and I assume no I'll be the only

00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,720
person who ever works on this I don't

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,090
need to take these things into

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,030
consideration and then I tripped myself

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:57,540
up from pone not knowing what I wrote

00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:00,390
when I go back to a later stage or then

00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,890
somebody else takes on that code later

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:05,010
on and they have trouble understanding

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,450
it so I'd say always have always write

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:10,100
with the assumption that somebody else

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:12,780
is going to be reading it just to be

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:17,970
just to be ethical with your colleagues

00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:20,280
I would argue and even if you're the

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,900
sole developer on projects it's likely

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,670
you will not be at some point and

00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,500
particularly if that project has a long

00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:30,480
life at some point you will not be the

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,890
only developer on that project and keep

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,210
up stay with the latest technologies now

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,600
this important for several reasons first

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,770
of all for your own development and just

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,580
to keep yourself ahead of the curve and

00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,590
primarily also to make sure you're

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,450
building the best possible websites for

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,780
your clients and to make sure you're not

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:54,120
using potentially outdated methods which

00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:55,710
could also be in secure methods and if

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,420
you're thinking of it just selfishly is

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,790
also for your selling to add more skills

00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:04,470
to your belt so I know it's very easy

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,970
for a lot of developers to get stuck in

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,530
they working with one particular

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,110
framework or working with one particular

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,150
CMS but I do think there's a lot to

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,310
learn from other communities and there's

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:20,580
a lot to learn

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:24,300
other areas of web development mentor

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,750
newer members of the community so again

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,250
this is there is a slightly self-serving

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,260
thing to this I think obviously it's

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,840
good to help new members of the

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,130
community to learn from yourself if

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,230
you're a more senior developer and to

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,680
actually learn from each other if you're

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:44,580
not more senior and personally I find

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,200
that when I'm mentoring less experienced

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,420
developers I find it actually helps me

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,430
to be a better developer and it actually

00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:54,570
helps me to notice the shortcomings in

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:56,820
my own skill set so it's good obviously

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,260
to make sure that we have more skilled

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,830
professionals in the workforce in the

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,840
future in so a few years time and to

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,850
make sure that they're equipped to help

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,430
each other and equip to build on their

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,020
own experience and keep us having a

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:14,820
steady stream of people entering the

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,350
profession and also it does help to help

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:21,150
yourself at least in my experience it

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:22,980
helped me to mentor people embrace open

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,170
source so even if you're not

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,760
contributing code there's many ways you

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:31,830
can contribute to open source you can do

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,720
testing you can perhaps if you're a

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,480
designer you could be designing some

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,730
assets for these open source projects or

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,230
giving a talk at a conference or so on

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:47,700
so I think it's important to contribute

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:49,110
to open source because I believe we've

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,450
open sourced the more you put in the

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,070
more you get out of it so if you're

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,360
conjugating code for example to

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:59,910
WordPress then you make sure that you're

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,080
getting a bit of product back and the

00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,430
more people that actually contribute to

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,820
something the greater it can be over

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:08,190
time and this is I think the same reason

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:12,270
why the Linux operating system works so

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:14,340
well because it's been over many many

00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:16,890
years many people have contributed to it

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,300
but giving up their time to do that and

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,130
then they get a bit of product back and

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,650
the same with what's been done with

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:25,380
WordPress many contributions been put in

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,279
and that is it's like an investment of

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:32,580
your own times

00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:35,099
you get something better back and why

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,349
the second to last point I said don't be

00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:41,429
afraid to turn down projects that you

00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:44,279
have objections to so these objections

00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:45,859
could be political cultural moral it

00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:49,440
could be around the company's reputation

00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:50,090
or it could be objections to particular

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:57,440
industries

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:59,759
I think if if budget is permitting or if

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,869
yeah obviously we all do need to pay the

00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,359
bills so I can understand why people

00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:06,169
would take on any projects but if if

00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:10,080
you're in a position to I would argue to

00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:12,749
ask some questions about would I take on

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,739
this project and what could it mean for

00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:20,599
myself or my company in the long run if

00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:23,009
this project well if we took this on my

00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:28,129
my general quit my general way of

00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:30,419
thinking is I ask myself is this a

00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:33,509
project that I would be comfortable

00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:37,320
admitting to on my portfolio or would I

00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:41,279
be comfortable actually telling anybody

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,389
that I'm working on this I for example

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:48,960
for myself I tend to avoid stuff that's

00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:50,609
too politically charged that's and I

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,839
tend to avoid like the gambling sector

00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:54,899
and anything that's too politically

00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:57,179
charged because but other than that I

00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:58,799
mean there's not remain projects I

00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,700
wouldn't do so long as I think the

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:05,099
company is reputationally sound and so

00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,690
I'd argue to look at your own moral

00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,029
framework and don't feel you need to

00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:13,259
sell out your own values just to make

00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:16,769
some money on a project and follow your

00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:18,479
gut instinct lastly so ask yourself if

00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:21,859
it's it's right if the project sits

00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:21,859
right with you before accepting it

00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,830
[Music]

00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:30,139
before making a technical decision ask

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:32,190
whether any users clients colleagues or

00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:34,950
anybody else you can think of would be

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:38,570
unfairly disadvantaged by this or would

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,570
be put out by this in some way

00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,960
and no potential moral or Africa issues

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:47,590
around the software is too small to

00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,030
consider particularly now where the

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:52,390
software is such a huge part of

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:54,670
everybody's life and it intertwines in

00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:57,460
every aspect of our day-to-day lives and

00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:00,550
so I don't think any moral or ethical

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:03,730
concern is too small to think about it

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:06,310
may seem very trivial but then as we

00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,190
find often with applications and

00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:14,260
software a lot of them have caused some

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:15,220
very large social changes and at the

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,750
time when they were built these things

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:20,620
probably would not have been thought

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:23,440
about but it's important to think about

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,820
perhaps if you I would argue even if you

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,530
write the code in a certain way what

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,960
could that mean for performance what

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,780
could it mean for adoption or what could

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:37,810
it mean for passing that feature across

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:41,920
and how it's delivered so my last point

00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,690
is thank you and let's all try and make

00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,900
the internet and our profession a better

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,900
place

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:56,490
that was a wonderful quiz and also I

00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,830
feel like it's very timely with AI about

00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,790
to take over all of our lives and folks

00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,810
if we've got any questions for Chris

00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:06,600
it's all questions gotten questions

00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,820
okay I'll kick off then um a new

00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,020
experience what's the biggest moral or

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,890
ethical issue you've had to deal with in

00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:17,600
your career oh yes in my career it's

00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:21,840
been mainly around data capture and

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:25,250
perhaps clients wanting to farm a lot of

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:29,190
data on users and their browsing habits

00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:31,650
often they say it's for marketing but it

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:36,750
seems like it's kind of unnecessarily

00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:42,960
want into so the way I came across that

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:44,460
is just this was before GDP are i simply

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,870
are to have a frank conversation with

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,570
the client and ask well why do you

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,790
exactly need to know what they're

00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,650
browsing when they're not when they're

00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,410
on your site say tomorrow or why do you

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:58,320
need to know that and once you have a

00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:01,080
frank conversation then I think I they

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,420
realized that a lot of the stuff they

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,250
wanted to collect on users they probably

00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,520
wouldn't really have much use for it

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,820
and it would just be be a bit creepy to

00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:15,140
be honest but that I would say that's

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:18,690
probably the biggest role thing I've had

00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,880
the other has been around you know

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:24,360
looking at pink competitors sites and

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,580
trying to see what we could add a copy

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,690
from that so you know thanks a lot of

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,960
sensors we're going any other questions

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,960
at all

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,300
that was very interesting thank you

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,440
thanks um do you have any view on the

00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,450
kind of sentiment that sometimes

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,160
expressed I think it came Zuckerberg of

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,290
gonna move fast and break things

00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,120
oh sorry can you repeat that do you have

00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:50,190
any view on the ethics of the sentiment

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,240
development sentiment of move fast and

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:58,980
break things yeah in development I think

00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,200
that's fine it's I mean obviously in a

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,820
development environment that's totally

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,830
fine that's why we have development

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,570
environments so we can break it apart

00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:10,560
and actually not worry about the

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,720
implications of it the however on the

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,440
other side of that I think my concerns

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,910
are rushing software which has been

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,840
something I've had to push back a lot

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:26,040
with some clients and stakeholders that

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,570
is particularly from maybe non techie

00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,540
staff who are making decisions there's

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:33,450
often a urgency to push this stuff into

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,520
production which i think is quite

00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,900
dangerous because it could be stuff

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,550
that's not been well thought out it

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,870
could be stuff that causes problems

00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:45,480
elsewhere and I my force on it you know

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:47,280
in development it's fine to do it fast

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,140
and break things but when you're

00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,810
actually pushing things to production I

00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,480
think no application is too small to

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:59,870
have a proper development process that

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,870
goes from dev to staging and then live

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:11,790
any other questions folks with the

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,160
emphasis these days on environmental

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,780
issues you know obviously the internet

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,740
and server farms and all the client

00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,270
devices consume a huge amount of power

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:24,210
what are your thoughts on that and do

00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,920
you have any suggestions for what we as

00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,010
developers can do is to make our sites

00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,320
more efficient use power you know in

00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:35,430
both on the server in delivery and on

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,740
client devices sure so I think first

00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:40,740
foremost if you're looking at the code

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:44,840
specifically have code that's actually

00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:47,220
efficient and does more in less so

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,770
that's partly why I

00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,370
stay away from procedural programming I

00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:56,700
try and go class-based and MVC

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:59,490
so obviously you get the performance

00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,169
benefit from that but it also means the

00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:05,190
server is using less resources which

00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:07,230
means less power on one server it's very

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,169
it could be quite minimal saving in

00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,789
power but if every site was built in

00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:15,450
that way it would mean less resources

00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:18,090
being used on a server farm aside from

00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:21,270
that I would say if Abe if you're one is

00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:23,460
able to then perhaps move the site or

00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:26,100
software to why are the green hosting

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:31,260
companies that are becoming it's there's

00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:33,409
quite growing industry now any more

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,309
questions

00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,929
okay I think that's it

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:39,150
good stuff so that was a wonderful talk

00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:47,299
please quick give Chris someone

00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:47,299
