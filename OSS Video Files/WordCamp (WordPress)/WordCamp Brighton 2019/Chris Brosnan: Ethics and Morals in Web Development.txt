Title: Chris Brosnan: Ethics and Morals in Web Development
Publication date: 2019-10-27
Playlist: WordCamp Brighton 2019
Description: 
	How can we ensure that we adapt the same standards of fairness, openness and inclusion at the heart of the WordPress community into our day-to-day web development projects?
How can we not only support but be champions of the open-source ethos of WordPress to clients and stakeholders?
Has the nature of building web applications evolved so much that we must now consider the possibility of an ethical and moral code by which we scope for and build web applications, particularly for WordPress sites?
I will attempt to (briefly) answer some of these questions, give my own thoughts on this and highlight some of the possible things that we need to consider beyond web performance, UX/UI, loading times and code quality.
No matter what the project is, we have certain moral and ethical issues around equality, fairness and inclusion that need to be considered more so now than ever before.
