00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:25,369
have our passions in our professions

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:30,650
some of us have our passions outside our

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:33,769
professions and then you find us the

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:39,500

are compressing stories aren't enough

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,640

00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:08,630

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:15,380

income in the gourmet society what

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:25,390
you've been doing but I think what you

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:28,370
have already been doing I'm a teacher

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,580
on top of being a teacher I'm the

00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,890
appropriate of Eastern internet cafes

00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:37,040
the director is on spoon of computing

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,830
and happy to serve as a coordinator for

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
the central region for the ICT

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:47,400
Association

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:51,430
I attended my first vodka in November

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:55,440
last year and a few months down the road

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm here to share my experience

00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,980
I started my first blow was in the work

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,220
the website for the Teachers Association

00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:12,980
which is ICT to chastity got niche

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,140
that's why I started writing articles on

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,320
what I do on my experiences in the field

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,230
of teaching and therapy on my other

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,750
businesses then I got this

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,490
maybe I should also start a blog an

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,660
independent blow an independent blog

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,090
different from what I've been blogging

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,110
in the ICT teacher's website so I

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,570
started small business tips ug dot-com

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,660
so when I started doing this I found

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,240
that maybe I can also earn something if

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,180
I did something for another person I was

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,500
lucky enough to get a client who came

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:54,980
and told me he needed a website since I

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,380
have Sam this is in WordPress I credit

00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,550
for him a website that is free hugs Gigi

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,530
Oh after I think that and when the guy

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:07,130
was happy yet also saying that the

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,520
website was kind of lacking for him he

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,610
was happy I say so I can start my own so

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,920
right now I'm working on a project not

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:25,250
yet completed davidovich dirt is on

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:28,040
school.com does my current project this

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,880
is the reason why many of us whether

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,340
some will deny but you want to say they

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:39,580
want to make money they want to make

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,580
ends meet many many other reasons

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,910
and they need to supplement our because

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,540
like I say it keeps on rising so this is

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:53,120
our passion in conjunction but right now

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,880
we are doing such that many people

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,920
become automatic dying inside our

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:03,830
pockets Oprah Winfrey says if you really

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,040

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,980
passion on your body and everybody

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,100
including you has one trust your heart

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:17,989
and success will come to you the snow

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:23,060
prevented for those who know what's your

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:26,900
passion is it fashion is it dead is it

teaching I don't know today what press

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,240

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,880
truth is in here we are for today some

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,060

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,200

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:38,900

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:45,620
advocate as more people click on this

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,100
adverts the website is built in money

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:52,370
and you're still seated in your office

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:55,870
does the deputy or an ordinary teacher a

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,870
scope of representation

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:12,070
in this garden pasta

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,660
I did

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:41,140
like I say I created my past websites in

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,230
just a month of attending the webcam in

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,730
kampar in November in December already

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,890
had a client and here I was then

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:54,670
technically for me I love Baron computer

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:58,740
savvy that is master in virtually a fine

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,959
one just to fill the fill it and then

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,690
one day I wrote an article about

00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,750
NComputing still on the eat our website

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,209
I was just sharing my experience I was

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:14,260
surprised that I got over 3,000 clicks

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:17,380
this 3000 is it will be any money from

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:21,010
their clicks but the calls that came

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:24,700
from teachers both within Uganda and

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:27,490
outside unless they added something to

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:31,470
my income house then something out of

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:34,140
passion I was doing it because I

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,970
experienced it I did you know that

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,459
indirectly some of the important and

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,800
computing gadgets for me you wouldn't

00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:45,750
have known me if I hadn't written this

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,750
article I think so

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,100
but then everyone asks people have ways

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,800
of getting their money why why do I

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,940
choose WordPress now personally when I

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:08,050
look at this graph in 2011 WordPress was

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:12,910
far in 13.1% of websites maybe it was in

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,310
sinners 2012 it went on increasing he

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,850
did mind some of us who are still in

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,370
school no no I wasn't in school in 2011

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:25,420
but maybe you were skeptical that kept

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:29,730
on increasing and then in 2018 WordPress

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:33,340
is firing over 30% of websites now

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:40,420
should we say these people are there by

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:43,390
mistake yes go one thing I want I like

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:49,210
about WordPress there is a lot of

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:53,320
supports the WordPress community they

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:55,930
have meetups regular meat meat as I

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,820
think its monthly the WordPress

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,520
committee has the Versa rookie I knew

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:04,260
even in other countries I belong to

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,670
these groups I've not yet attended Anita

00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,100
virus I mean the groups you ask a

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,560
question or someone gives advice free of

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,480
charge

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,670
there is a website I visited or doubt a

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,550
Filipina dot-com

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,740
any question Wanda is talking to Rogers

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,800
Rogers told me you got it out of the

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,660
beginner Europe and ask a new question

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,740
whatever you ask whatever you're going

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:32,680
to us someone asked some years ago on

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:36,310
the demons then YouTube is there for us

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,390
still people upload upload videos about

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,990
that

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:43,540
experience on how they are solving

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,420
anything needed within WordPress and

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,610
then with WordPress we still have what

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,130
comes these are the results why am i

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:57,970
prefer workplace we are the heavily

00:12:51,130 --> 00:13:00,760
subsidised post facility but like you

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,860
here that's one of the reasons I prefer

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:09,640
twelve bits and I know they are still

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:12,280
organize more and more and then in other

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,640
reason why I prefer WordPress that ease

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,890
of use the installation takes sometimes

00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,320
I did five minutes but when I was

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,330
branded with Mike Eruzione started with

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,160
specialist and I think around a minute

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:29,530
or two and installed WordPress then

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,940
WordPress has a horde of things you're

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,830
going to think about something that

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,380
doesn't exist I'll start in there

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:40,810
every website for a hospital school in

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:45,220
Nazareth is for speech anything what was

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:48,040
hosting those who find those who don't

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,940

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,740

00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:00,190
website is one and a half hours but in

00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,810
the past a terminus of the the video you

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,950
know you throw away the video and start

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:08,440
making your site

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:10,530
I know comfortable destroy it now what

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,660
do you need to create a wordpress site

00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:16,680
one thing is of course you will attack

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,680
