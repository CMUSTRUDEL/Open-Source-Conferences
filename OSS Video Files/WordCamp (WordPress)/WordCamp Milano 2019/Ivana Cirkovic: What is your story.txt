talk is about storytelling which is

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,920
something that brought us all here today

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,850
and throughout the day you will hear

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,479
many stories and I invite you to pay

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,909
attention to what people are saying what

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,359
kind of stories they are sharing and try

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,310
to discover the type of story they are

00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,219
talking about which is something that I

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,759
will share with you in a little bit so

00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:50,279
we are here today to talk about stories

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,069
in a way to use them to promote yourself

00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:55,469
your businesses your work and to get

00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,659
benefit of it whether it's self

00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,179
recognition or promotion of your work

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,060
your business you're attracting new

00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:05,909
clients whatever that might be and at

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,960
the very start I would like to begin

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,150
with this quote from another tech guy

00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,180
Paul Jarvis who said that everything can

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,310
be a story you just got to tell it

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,140
and I truly believe that each and every

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:24,090
one of us has a story to tell and it's

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,640
something that we been using from a

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,640
beginning of time like we grew up with

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,139
stories through our parents or our

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,930
grandparents even today this is my kind

00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:39,930
of story something I share with you so

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,629
we are gathered here to talk about how

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,230
to use the structured story to tell your

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:49,950
business to tell what is that sets you

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:55,530
apart from your competition and to get

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:58,260
results driven results now I'm sure you

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,530
you heard about this sentence disclaim

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:06,030
but have you ever wondered what does it

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:10,620
mean like for me I I find this sentence

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:14,099
a bit called too generic and this claim

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,489
is like uninspiring even for me because

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:21,239
what is behind this sentence content is

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:24,449
King for me it's about the contest

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,139
context not the the content itself

00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:31,229
because any type of content whether it's

00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:34,739
photo or visual any kind of combination

00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:37,909
of words or video it's the context that

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,069
matters and that context is actually

00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:45,720
storytelling the way we use our words

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:48,780
our visuals to share whether it's our

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,379
emotion or to explain some complex

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,870
information shared knowledge useful tips

00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,979
and tricks which we all will do here

00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,129
today so when I hear this content is

00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,639
king actually I'm talking about

00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:08,699
storytelling because it's the core

00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:14,069
essence of every content is and should

00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:16,440
be at least storytelling now this is

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,049
something I came up with some time ago

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,959
when when I was searching how to portray

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:25,760
how people see storytelling people who

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:28,139
are not familiar with this subject so

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,219
from there for the out

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:35,000
word world storytelling is portrayed as

00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:38,039
something a bit of bragging

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,520
self-promotion but the truth couldn't be

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:45,449
much more far from it because

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:49,680
storytelling is is a skill it is a skill

00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:52,139
that you use to provoke emotion to get

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,050
people to act upon what you're saying

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,689
and it's not something like hey look at

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,909
me I'm the great performer I am I'm

00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:03,779
killing with making websites or I do

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:06,479
great copywriting no show people the way

00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,729
that you do business or your product or

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,129
your services are helping people and

00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:17,150
that's the core of storytelling to

00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:19,439
persuade people how how by using your

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,199
special skills your products your

00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,110
services is actually helping them

00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:30,060
solving their problem or making their

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:35,580
lives even better and with that in mind

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:38,699
oh this is OK Apple Airbnb coca-cola

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,569
Lego naik the one thing they all have in

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:45,599
common is that they all built their

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:49,529
businesses with stories because Apple

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,509
doesn't sell devices it sells power and

00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,289
a lifestyle as well as coca-cola it's

00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:56,520
not a drink

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:57,210
but a like vivid lifestyle Lego doesn't

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,810
sell toys

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,960
it says imagination and I would add one

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,810
more brand on that equation and that is

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,469
WordPress because WordPress doesn't sell

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:13,349
platform for your websites but as I

00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:15,870
think of it reliable and safe home for

00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:19,560
your stories whatever they might be and

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:23,610
because we are here on work camp Milano

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,860
there is a big part of WordPress that is

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:30,629
engaging in storytelling which will I

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:36,419
talk about a bit later and knowing all

00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:38,849
that what is how can we use those tips

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,880
and tricks I will share and storytelling

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:47,910
itself to promote ourselves and to get

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:51,090
value from it there are like basic seven

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:54,450
types of stories you can use to portray

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,970
your visions your goals your your

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,280
businesses and to promote them through

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,550
storytelling now these seven types it's

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,830
not something that I invented it is

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,230
based upon a research of the thousands

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,350
and thousands professionals and writers

00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:13,740
so they came up with these basic seven

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:16,680
types which are the underdog or the hero

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:22,800
story which is something that you will

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:27,600
use to describe you or your business is

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,030
a hero and some problem or the way you

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,050
are conducting your business or some

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:36,780
obstacles are the villain and how are

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,240
you overcoming those obstacles and

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,690
becoming the better person or better

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,090
professional or the obstacles can be

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,150
something some problem or issue your

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,740
customer or target audience has

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,500
described use this type of story to

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:55,290
describe the way you and your business

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,050
is solving problem to your customers and

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,690
that and then you have this hero or the

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:05,220
underdog story then we have the quest

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:08,820
story which is a story about let's say

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,090
you have some goal desire some idea and

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:17,640
you want to make it happen describe the

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:20,160
ways or the steps you use to make this

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,190
dream come true so that would be the

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,410
quest story and it is informational type

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,720
of story it is something that your

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,760
target audience can learn from so by

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,250
sharing your knowledge your path you are

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:36,800
helping your target audience and at the

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,870
same time you are making them realize

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,419
humans behind your business and they can

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,060
connect easier with you then you have

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:50,910
the the classic journey return type of

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:52,800
story and that is the story you coming

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,870
out of the comfort zone it can be

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,649
something like

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,180
[Music]

00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:04,559
like my story I wasn't from a tech

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:07,439
industry I am a mother of three I am

00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,769
totally in the marketing industry and

00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:13,579
somehow along the way I started learning

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:17,220
about the ways I can share my story and

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:20,519
be more out there to the target audience

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,619
so I discovered among after many many

00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,920
other platforms I discovered WordPress

00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:28,589
and learn to use it in a way that helped

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,779
me share my story to more people and to

00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:34,139
more targeted people so that can be the

00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:38,309
journey return a type of story then we

00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:42,389
have rags to riches story type of story

00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:45,980
that is Cinderella or ugly duckling or

00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:49,829
even Oprah like how think of the ways

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:53,490
their path is and how they bloom out of

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:57,720
nothing so again it can be something

00:09:53,490 --> 00:10:02,279
that you found yourself in the totally

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,829
unknown situation and rise above comedy

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:08,249
type of story that is something that can

00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:11,370
be funny anecdotal story about your

00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:14,519

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,590
the way you are showing them that you're

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,890
human you are not some developer robot

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,620
who are just doing codes and numbers but

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,840
you are you me you're making mistakes in

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,330
you learn from them so by sharing those

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,250
type of stories you show yourself as a

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,530
good professional but at the same time

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,470
you're educating some future developers

00:11:52,530 --> 00:12:00,120
or business owners with the stuff you

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:04,020
did and those types of stories you can

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,150
use any or each of them to portray what

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,580
it is that you do but it's not enough

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,460
those stories that you tell needs to

00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,790
have some more elements and it is

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:18,300
something that I will share now a good

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:22,290
story is something that first of all

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,720
good story is simple you tell your story

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:28,380
by using tone of voice your audience

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,190
uses you are all professionals here and

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,800
you talk very specifically but outside

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,400
of your bubble common people don't

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,980
understand all those equations coding

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,020
whatever there is that you do and use in

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,510
your everyday language with your

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,970
colleagues so use the tone of voice your

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:53,610
target audience uses may make your story

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:55,800
is very easy and is easily readable and

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,560
understandable

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,800
again good story provokes emotions

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,080
whether is happy you want to make people

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,350
happy or you want to rage them whatever

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,600
your end goal with the story is provoke

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,000
some kind of emotion those are all

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,750
triggers that will make your story more

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,350
memorable a good story is honest and

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,970
trusting you don't want to and it's real

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,620
or at least it

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,870
sounds real because you don't want to

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,319
make your story a bit of fairytale and

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,579
sci-fi that no one will connect with or

00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:32,519
believe it

00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:36,000
so always talk about from your

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,699
perspective but always think about the

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,160
end user or the reader the target

00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:44,250
audience what it is that you want them

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,889
to do with your story whether is to

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,410
understand it better or whether it's to

00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:52,410
know your work your business your

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:55,439
product how can it help them in their

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,939
lives and it needs to be relevant to the

00:13:55,439 --> 00:14:02,279
target group again if you are building

00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:05,670
websites you and you are building

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,550
websites like niche targeted websites

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,579
for let's say photography professionals

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,920
you don't want to talk about for and to

00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,439
share stories for mommy bloggers because

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,220
it's not relevant for them so make your

00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:22,610
stories as more specifics as you can to

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:27,230
reach the dead target audience

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:30,959
now we covered the type of stories and

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:33,029
necessary elements but is it enough like

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,819
you will you know what to write about

00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:39,180
you you know who are you talking to and

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:42,420
you came up with great typo story to

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:45,449
share but is it enough of course not

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:49,079
because your stories we are talking

00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:52,379
about online storytelling internet open

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:55,889
us a huge amount of possibilities to and

00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:59,009
it's helping us share our stories even

00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:01,589
by there so with that in mind we need to

00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:04,350
optimize our stories for both people and

00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,930
search engines because no matter how

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:10,019
great story you came up with if it's not

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,639
optimized for web for web search you

00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,860
won't get the results that you need

00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,069
because you might miss the opportunity

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,589
to to get discovered on Google or any

00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:23,819
other search engine which is why I want

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:27,360
to share some quick and easy sem easy

00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:29,069
on-page SEO tips and what it is that all

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,259
of you can do with your stories to

00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:33,550
polish them up and make them even better

00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:39,520
and more discoverable on

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:44,200
gooble and this is something that I came

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,510
up with during recent years like the

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,690
anatomy of the perfectly written text no

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:53,110
matter is it your story blog post an

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,540
article the necessary basic necessary

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,510
elements every type of story needs to

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:02,310
have in order to be discovered on search

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:06,100
engines now this is part of on-page SEO

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:08,080
and it is something that you any of you

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,399
can do with your content on your

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,399
websites on your blogs but just doing

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,980
this it's not enough your website needs

00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,350
to be like hosting needs to be fast

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,370
servers needs to be fast technical SEO

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:27,490
needs to be done properly and then this

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:31,029
which will make you stand out and be

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,589
more discoverable on search engines of

00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:35,920
course if you did your keyword research

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:39,790
right and get the right target audience

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,910
so let us start the headline is the the

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:46,870
main thing you need to worry about after

00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:49,720
you've written your your story based

00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,209
upon the research and the right key

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,279
phrase that your target audience uses

00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:57,459
and that you want to compete for you

00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:01,410
need to think about the way to use that

00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:04,959
key phrase in the headline to be

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:07,510
reliable relevant and natural in the

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,720
headline headline doesn't need to be

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:14,230
clickbait because it's something you all

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,350
seen it it's something Daily Mail and

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:19,270
all other daily news use to to grab

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,670
people's attention but they don't

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,120
provide what value if you use click

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,610
baits

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,280
be sure to deliver the promise from that

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,950
click bait itself so the headline needs

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,650
to be very concrete very specific to to

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:36,970
have the desired key a key phrase in it

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,820
and it needs to be the length of it is

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:42,190
about 60 characters it's or the key

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,380
phrase needs to be in that 60 characters

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:49,130
because it's the the the length of the

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,760
visibility in the search result then we

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,890
have Meta Description which is something

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,860
many people overlook like okay I will

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,040
put one or two sentences between in

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,550
attendance that Meta Description is like

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,310
a hook it is something that promises to

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,470
reader to two people who use search

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,780
engines that they will find the answer

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,520
if they click on your result so make

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:19,700
sure that and the length of it is about

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,980
140 to 160 characters make sure to put

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,790
the key phrase in it as well if it's

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,440
natural and to make it stand out give

00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:31,250
people the reason to click on your

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:35,840
result and not on someone else's then

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:38,750
the contact itself your story if you you

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,590
did your research well and you know what

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,200
you're talking about

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:46,430
don't shy away from the length of the

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,440
story people no matter how busy we all

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,320
are if it's something that interests us

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,630
we will find the time to read no matter

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,540
the length of the article or the story

00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:00,050
is so put yourself out there and write

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:02,870
as long as you can or as long as it

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:04,880
needs to be written like whatever there

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:08,870
is that you want to say don't shy away

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,270
from the length of it because people

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,820
from ones want to know and the other

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:18,670
thing Google likes longer articles there

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:22,010
was in 2016 a research of the about

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:25,010
10,000 result on the first page of

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:28,070
Google and approximately length of the

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:30,800
articles that are on the first ten spots

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:34,610
on Google on the first page are one

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:39,410
thousand and six hundred words so Google

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:43,070
likes longer articles another thing you

00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,710
need more space to to go indie as much

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,410
in details as you can you can say and

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:51,340
share your expertise or whatever is that

00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:54,890
you want to say with your story in like

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,159
300 400 words I mean that that doesn't

00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,999
bring you value not to mention that

00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:03,489
story with less than 300 words is

00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,950
considered to be a spam doesn't provide

00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:09,340
value so make sure that your content is

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:13,419
well written it's it takes you don't shy

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:16,450
away from the length and use don't just

00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:19,539
use words use the help of the

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:22,090
photographs of other kind of visuals

00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:24,609
like infographics or video because you

00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,919
can even tell more specifically your

00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:30,220
story with them people connect with the

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:33,759
photographs much easier than the word

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,519
sometime but also it's another benefit

00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,609
because you can get discovered with

00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:42,279
images as well by explaining your what

00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,950
it is on that image image alt tag that

00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,399
is called describe what it is on that

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,799
image and maybe you won't get discovered

00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:53,049
via regular search but we are Google

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,710
search people will find you so that's a

00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:59,349
bonus as well and then when you wrote

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,599
your story in it that way

00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:05,879
provided value for the target audience

00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:08,499
like answer the question help them

00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:10,840
understand what is it what it is that

00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:12,840
you do and how that what you do can

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,849
benefit them and make their lives easier

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,389
then and only then at the end you will

00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,809
put call to action ask something in

00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:22,330
return

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:25,960
whether it's you want them to share your

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:29,379
story or to ask you some questions or

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,809
you want them to sign up for your

00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:34,299
newsletter or buy an e-book whatever is

00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:37,179
that you want with that story and from

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:39,249
them you will put at the end because you

00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:42,190
have to give something first in order to

00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:45,009
ask it something from them and then of

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,309
course after afterwards you need to make

00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:51,159
your story more shareable which includes

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:54,119
put all those sharing buttons make

00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:57,549
people easy to share your story like

00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:58,359
user experience needs to be dead that

00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,229
easy

00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:03,489
and by doing all that you

00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:07,200
congratulations you just did your own

00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:10,750
page SEO and helped your story stand out

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,870
from the from the crowd so whatever

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,540
type of sorry use this is the way to

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,150
polish them also when you write longer

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:24,430
articles it's helpful to use bullet

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:29,590
points to to like break those big chunks

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:32,530
of text with some subheadings and bullet

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:37,780
points to make people easier to to

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:40,750
scroll and to like read your your story

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:44,650
because if you have just a chunk of text

00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:49,020
it's not very engaging and people will

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:51,940
lose interest like the break it read

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,920
photograph with like that bullet points

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,250
and subheadings also that is something

00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,660
that Google likes and it's it's more

00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:04,360
easier for their algorithm and spiders -

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:10,300
like scroll it tend to index it in that

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:13,630
way now that we done that there are also

00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,720

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:19,390

rely on tools I can use to help me in

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,980

grammarly is a tool I use on a daily

00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:42,670
basis because I have numerous foreign

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:46,120

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,180
really a life Savior if you are writing

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,910
content on English

00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,780

enough easy understandable to your

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:15,010
audience it checks if the length of the

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:17,730
sentence is too long if it's too complex

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:21,179
it will notify you with different colors

00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:24,300
help you make it more understandable

00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:27,630

a designer or you don't want to pay them

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,230
sorry you can use tools like this to

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,270
really help you if you are just starting

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,340

visuals for that accommodate your story

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:50,870
and of course talking about shareability

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,290
because even Google needs help in that

00:24:50,870 --> 00:25:00,090
matter

00:24:52,290 --> 00:25:02,580
social media some say are not SEO type

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,920
of signal but I think it is because the

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,440
more people share your stories it

00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,990
indexes Google itself some kind of

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,480
signal that that story matters and it

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:16,590
will give some more juice to it and more

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,780
visibility in time so go on social where

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,060
your target audience is connect with

00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,260
them and share your stories there as

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:28,440
well interesting snapchat are a way to

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:31,490
discover relevant topics and to see what

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,280
type of stories people want to to

00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:37,830
connect with today because we are

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,410
getting younger and younger target

00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:43,050
audience like today's kids will be our

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,420
tomorrow's customers we need to

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,640
understand the way they want to connect

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:52,050
and interact with the content in order

00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:55,770
to serve them our stories properly and I

00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:58,050
would like to add one more tool there

00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:06,210
which is something that I've been using

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:09,150
since 2012 and that is WordPress not

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:13,050
because this is a work camp Milano but

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:15,440
I've been using all sorts of CMS's out

00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:20,340
there I started with blogspot like in

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:24,090
2005 and 6 then went on to Joomla I

00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,390
worked with typo3 like I've been all

00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:29,760
over the place and I really couldn't

00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,800
connect with all those platform in a way

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,150
that I did it with WordPress which

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,770
really makes made my life and my work

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,740
that much easier

00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:45,540
today I have about ten websites that I

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:48,780
own and work with my own not my clients

00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:53,820
and then client websites so I really

00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:59,610
needed a reliable CMS that I could use

00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:02,100
that I could let's say share my

00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:05,160
knowledge about with other colleagues so

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,800
that I wouldn't need to rely on

00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,390
programmer for any type of work that I

00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,670
needed to done

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,160
Jumma didn't work for me I worked with

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:18,360
it three years and it was really really

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:21,590
disasterous and the moment I transferred

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,660
my sites on WordPress like that was the

00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:27,090
beginning of everything and

00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:29,160
exponentially rise for me what I like

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,580
about WordPress is that is initially

00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,920
free you don't need any money to to work

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,850
with it you can like only buy a domain

00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,800
and buy hosting and start building your

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,200
site you can build your site on

00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,920
WordPress yourself like there are tons

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,230
of useful tutorials and thanks to you to

00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,470
open-source community we can all learn

00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:54,810
to do it ourselves

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:57,300
the the amount of teams of plugins or

00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:00,870
widgets we can use it's really something

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:03,270
that is made my life easier not to

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,340
mention that WordPress is very SEO

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:08,280
friendly which is also something that I

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:11,070
debate with other SEO professionals

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,470
because they tend to say that WordPress

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,480
is not as your friendly but I know for a

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,900
fact that it is because all of you are

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,470
doing and making it better by following

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:27,180
Google's tips and tricks and ways to

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:30,720
make the code reliable not to mention

00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:34,080
Yoast uses day-to-day collaboration with

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,970
Google to make their products SEO

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,350
friendly so really it is something that

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:44,070
that made my life very easy and of

00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:49,700
course thanks to Gutenberg it all made

00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:52,009
me make it and work within it

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,149
with more fun now I don't know the back

00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:56,359
end of story

00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:59,029
with Gutenberg and what it is that it

00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,079
drives developers crazy but for me as a

00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,869
content creator

00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,239
Reutimann really helped me to play

00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:08,059
around with content much more than the

00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:13,070
old WordPress editor did so there's a

00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:15,979
plus another tool and in a way to let's

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:18,559
say put money where my mouth is American

00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:21,649
expression I want to show you a few

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,509
examples to know that the system works

00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:28,969
the the stuff that I talked to you about

00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:32,239
briefly now really works you've all

00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:35,719
heard about Yost and their Yost Cone

00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:38,869
conference a CEO conference and when you

00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:42,200
type Yost con SEO tips the very first

00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:43,279
two results are my results that I did

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,769
for a client of mine

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:53,989
so not Yost not Yost con conference me

00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:56,899
like this is ten days ago I did hidden

00:29:53,989 --> 00:30:02,269
like Google search and this is articles

00:29:56,899 --> 00:30:05,570
I wrote for colleagues of yours max team

00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:08,749
developers which are my Serbian guys

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:10,909
that I discovered while using some of

00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:14,239
their teams and then we got to know each

00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:16,820
other started working together so I did

00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:19,749
a research what it is that some of their

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:25,789
target audience needs to hear to know

00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:30,529
wrote about these very specific yes

00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:32,389
Yoast con conference tips because people

00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:35,989
want to know what it is that is relevant

00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:39,529
in new and to implement it on their

00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:41,809
businesses so by using type of stories

00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:44,570
that I described and by optimizing the

00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:48,829
the articles and the stories in that way

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:51,999
I managed to not only for 2018 but for

00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:56,539
2019 as well to go on the first two

00:30:51,999 --> 00:31:00,589
results on Google but there's an even

00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:03,320
better example like such snippet it is

00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:05,810
like you can't pay for this

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,220
snippet is something that Google puts

00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:15,170
above the result one so again an article

00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:18,440
for for I did for max which is ambit

00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:21,260
Facebook video on WordPress and Google

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:26,000
found it so much trustworthy that it put

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:28,160
it as a top result when when people

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,330
search for it and as you can see there's

00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,850
me then people also ask and there's for

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,710
press beginner which is a phenomena in

00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,530
the content world and in the world of

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:44,390
sharing stories and I somehow was

00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:47,180
managed to go even higher than them also

00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:50,330
by using the type of stories I told you

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,370
by doing my research to the right target

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:56,150
audience using the tone of voice

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:58,850
those people use and by using the tools

00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:01,100
I've described such as grammerly it is a

00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:03,290
huge huge help if you are working with

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:06,200
the international audience and you want

00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:09,860
you are talking with them in English

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:14,360
use grammerly or any other relevant and

00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:18,410
similar tool because people really pay

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:21,220
attention to the the way you talk and

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:25,430
share your stories you don't want to be

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:28,970
misjudged or to sound unprofessional so

00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:33,650
grammar is a must if you are working in

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,940
English and just not to to think that

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:38,020
this is a mistake

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:41,270
here's another snippet again from X

00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:43,460
photo licenses because they have one of

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:47,110
their premium teams is targeted to

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:51,620
photography professionals and of course

00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:55,370
it is a huge huge deal to know about

00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,080
photo licenses or even for bloggers too

00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,210
often we see that people just go on

00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,930
google search type something relevant

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:05,870
for them and take any photo from Google

00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:09,020
but it's it's wrong it's not legal and

00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:11,200
you can get fine for it so this is an

00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,810
article that was really informational

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,540
for targeted audience to understand what

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:20,170
our photo licenses and

00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:23,050
how they they can use knowledge of this

00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:26,580
to discover for free photos they can use

00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:29,290
or in what amount they can use them so

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,890
now you know the system works if you

00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:36,280
implement anything that I told you today

00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:40,290
about and try to write your stories in a

00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:42,940
way to use type of story say I share to

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,970
use elements and include them in your

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:50,380
stories then there is no way you can't

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:54,370
be that good as I did again I'm not

00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:57,820
native English speaker but I somehow not

00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:00,250
somehow by my knowledge managed to get

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:03,100
these and many other results in the

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:06,550
first on the first page and among top

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:09,130
three top five results on Google so if I

00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:11,290
can do it all of you can just you need

00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:15,070
to know how and this is something that

00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:16,960
we briefly discussed now and I would

00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:19,120
like to finish this talk with the

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,000
another quote start with God finishing

00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:24,010
said guarding began to preneur from

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,860
America who said that marketing is not

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:29,520
longer about the stuff that you make but

00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,770
the stories you tell people don't trust

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,010
advertising they don't trust commercials

00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:39,850
and promotion over promotional content

00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,640
but they do tend to trust the stories

00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:45,370
that you share don't when you share your

00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:49,270
stories don't talk about your products

00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:51,820
and yourself per se talk about solution

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:55,600
you bring talked about the way you can

00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:58,030
ease people's pain and help them in

00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,400
their everyday lives and in that way in

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,400
that matter if you can do it then you

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,350
are one or two or three steps closer to

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,480
turning those target audience into

00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:12,820
future prospects your clients your

00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,340
colleagues whatever so I hope you

00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,890
enjoyed in this talk as much as I did

00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:20,230
thank you for your time and now we have

00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:24,310
some briefly time for questions if you

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:25,850
pick my brain we can sum up something

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:29,170
more thank you

00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:32,780
[Applause]

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:41,140
yeah she took come on don't be shy

00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:41,140
questions I love questions I'm a quest

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:52,900
thank you one a very good talk

00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,900
very interesting informative points

00:35:53,290 --> 00:36:04,190
about technical SEO so you know they say

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:09,109
Google is too smart in like recent years

00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:11,630
that it does it does semantic

00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:14,210
understanding of the content of the

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:17,630
pages so some people say SEO is not

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,520
relevant anymore which I disagree of

00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:22,309
course but I wanted to know what is your

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,599
idea okay

00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:29,030
I disagree as well I mean people who say

00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,890
that SEO isn't important are the people

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:35,660
who don't have time or knowledge or

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:39,490
willingness to work with it because it

00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:44,030
it's something that scares them and

00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:48,470
possibly something that they don't want

00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:52,010
to mess up with but the truth is SEO is

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:54,020
really highly important from the

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,690
technical point of view which is

00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:59,900
something that you need to have clean

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:03,799
code well-developed website that needs

00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:06,859
to be responsive quick load all of those

00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:10,400
stuff are important as much as this

00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:12,349
on-page SEO to make your content stand

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,900
out because if you have slow website

00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:18,319
people don't like people will go away

00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:21,710
and then there is a higher bounce rate

00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:25,790
and they won't come back then if it's

00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:28,460
not responsive we every one of us uses

00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:32,960
mobile phones so we want our information

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:35,150
very easily visible on mobile so all of

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,280
that it's important like it's incestual

00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,800
essential just like Google Analytics you

00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,620
good at the very beginning of building a

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,890
website and sharing content you need to

00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,840
have all SEO aspects in order for your

00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,740
website to work and your content to be

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,740
visible and shareable

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,670
they wouldn't have debt good results

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,220
they will they would possibly come on I

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:28,090
don't know third or fourth page of

00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:32,140
Google but not on first like it's it's

00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:35,620
not it's not possible to get without

00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:39,090
optimization because Google works on sod

00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:42,060
on search queries and it is our job to

00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:45,610
understand that and to guess and to

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,830
research those search queries from our

00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:50,470
relevant targeted audience in order to

00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:54,280
produce content in a way that they would

00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:56,170
like to read it and also to optimize it

00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,350
in a way that Google understands it and

00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:02,640
to put that with the specific keyword in

00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:05,640
search query and to show it on top

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:11,640
thank you more questions

00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,640
