I'm presenting Julia Locker here talking

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,650
about variable phones Julia is a web

00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:16,180
designer and like every what designer

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:19,180
had a good loves typography so is going

00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:24,040
to introduce us to this word about

00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:26,919
variable phones and yesterday talking

00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,119
with her about this talk he tells me

00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:35,470
that he wants to be really unintuitive

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:47,190
with this new kind of fonts so I give

00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:50,950
the word to Julia so thank you

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:56,350
variable phones the future of typography

00:00:50,950 --> 00:01:00,329
has already began did you realize it who

00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,329
know some things about variable phones

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,409
so we are going to discover something

00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:11,770
new today it looks like first of all let

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:16,479
me thank what come banana for having me

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:19,390
here and you can treat if you like to

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,440
know something to let people outside

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:28,870
know something about this and start with

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:32,729
the definition variable phones you might

00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:35,530
have seen some animations like this

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,390
animated gifs around the web and you

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:43,180
might have start thinking that variable

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:45,580
fonts something that moves maybe but

00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:51,400
that's not the main characteristics in

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,930
my opinion let me make a premise before

00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,840
all it's about typography and

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,150
terminology in English they have this

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:06,670
nice distinction between typeface and

00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:09,969
font but typeface is basically a concept

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:14,139
whereas in the digital world far a font

00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:15,400
either is a file in a metal word this is

00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:21,330
the font

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:24,310
more or less let's have an example

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,940
Roberto is a concept and is the typeface

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:32,799
whereas Roberto italic Roberto bald

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:35,140
robot a bold italic Oh Hans and then we

00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:38,230
have the typeface family

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,560
it's nice concept to to illustrate

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:45,459
variable fonts because the typeface

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,769
family is something that type designer

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:52,930
has put together under the same name the

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:57,989
name of the typeface but it happens by

00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:02,049
history and then we have the font family

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:05,500
that CSS property we use in our websites

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:07,900
we use the files in website in order for

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:14,170
them to work otherwise with concepts

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:17,920
they won't work everything we know about

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:21,130
typefaces and fonts comes from a history

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:27,510
along history five centuries of history

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:33,459
and at the beginning of the press era

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:35,620
the roman and italic versions weren't on

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:38,650
the same family and in the same on the

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,139
same page you have to wait a couple of

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:45,660
centuries in order to to have this

00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:50,560
pairing in a typeface and even even more

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:52,930
200 years later to have bigger families

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,349
with extended version of a phone the

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,949
compressed version and things like that

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:03,549
and then on we started having a big

00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:05,349
terminology in each language you see

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:09,400
might recognize in the Italian or

00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:14,859
English words like bold or Grosseto

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:19,419
things like that but let's go go back to

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:22,720
the future the future of today and I

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:26,860
have a question in the question who who

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,370
asked for variable phones well something

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:34,990
very unusual happened in the digit

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:37,270
industry at the end of 2016 there was an

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,930
agreement an industrial agreement

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:45,099
between forepeak names on the digital

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:50,039
world these for Microsoft Apple Adobe

00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:59,069
Google and they they agreed on a format

00:04:50,039 --> 00:05:04,020
yes the format was variable phones soon

00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:08,789
some other companies joined the crew and

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:13,589
what is the browser support for this

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:18,930
well one hour one year and a half later

00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:27,279
after the announcement it was at around

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:32,009
10 percent one year later it grows to do

00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:35,199
to almost 80 percent of global usage

00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:38,409
today we are here 87 percent of global

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,639
usage I've never seen anything in the

00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:45,219
web history anything going so fast in

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,710
the browser support maybe it's because

00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:54,909
of that agreement I guess so if you are

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:58,589
interested I go on what is the variable

00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:01,960
font well it's not a new format

00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:05,409
technically it's an evolution of an

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:11,770
already known format the open type it's

00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:13,629
just a new version this is the

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,979
definition they gave during the

00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:17,610
announcement it's bit difficult to

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:22,060
understand I'll try to clarify a bit a

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:25,919
variable font it says is a single font

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,039
file that behaves like multiple fonts

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:36,129
font kasey kahne portico meet aunty font

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:38,529
Kieran what does it mean well every time

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:42,669
you have something a new version of

00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:45,639
something we start with renaming the

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:48,330
they will diversion in anyway so since

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:52,360
we now have variable funds we can start

00:06:48,330 --> 00:07:00,789
rename the traditional fonts as static

00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:04,870
phones in a position this image might

00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:08,159
explain a bit better what I mean static

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:11,020
fonts are different files each of

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:14,319
different file deals with a particular

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:17,490
variation a particular style it's

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,370
compressed or it's extended its bold or

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,439
thin a thing like that

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:27,629
whereas a variable font is just a one

00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:31,240
single font file that behaves like

00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:33,189
multiple static forms so maybe you

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:38,789
understand a bit better the definitional

00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:38,789
before yes no a bit

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:51,009
well the main part of variable fonts is

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:55,110
the fact that they can take up they can

00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:59,649
take advantage of very of variation axes

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,479
acida variate z ona in italian here we

00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:05,490
have a representation a 3d

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,810
representation of a font with three axes

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,580
representing something with the four

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:15,279
axes it's bit more difficult but we can

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:22,710
have a lot of different axes in a

00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:27,939
variable font there are five registered

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:35,800
means predefined variable axis variation

00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:39,310
axes that the deal with traditional

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:43,690
typography let's say so we see later on

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:47,170
better and then you can have sorry a lot

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,430
of custom axes they up they are up to

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,430
the type designer

00:08:52,589 --> 00:09:03,190
the five registered ox is at this five

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:11,800
weight with Optical size difficult slant

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:16,480
in Renato it's Alec the way tax is it

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:22,750
the one that it's more useful I guess so

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:25,930
I try to explain this slide from one

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,329
side of the axis we have a character

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,450
with a very thin stroke from the other

00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:36,430
side of the axis we have a character

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:39,970
with a very strong stroke and between

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:44,079
those two we can have a lot of

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:47,700
variations I just draw one but you can

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,700
have a lot of variation

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:57,700
how much thin and how much bold the

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,740
character will be it's inside it's

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,290
defined inside a variable font by

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:07,079
numbers and we have to know those those

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,079
numbers in order to use them in our CSS

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,880
what happens when we add an extra axis

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,980
like the width axis we have an explosion

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:23,950
of possibilities these are nine but

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:28,829
there are a lot of in-between this

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,829
interpolation between all these shapes I

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:36,760
try to explain this third axis that

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:39,390
might be difficult to to grasp if you

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:44,560
don't have a bitter of typography

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:47,279
knowledge well what is the main

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,649
difference between the digital fonts and

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:55,390
metal phones that here we have or things

00:10:50,649 --> 00:11:02,440
like that the main difference is that in

00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:04,450
the old typography each type failed each

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,640
font was up

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:14,250
miles for a particular file size so you

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:19,560
had the proper font for each size and

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:22,390
they weren't only the same shape

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,960
shrinked or enlarged as we do it was

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:31,990
used we are used to do in the digital

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:35,380
world and with this axis the optical

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,980
size we can bring back this

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:42,850
characteristic to the digital world so

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:48,190
if we use a combination between the font

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:50,470
size and the optical size access we'll

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:54,460
end up with something like this font

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:57,460
optimized by size you might not notice

00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,600
the optimization I try to describe it a

00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,810
bit here we you have a font with two

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,930
strokes one thin and one strong the

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,330
contrast between the two is high you can

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:14,190
appreciate it in a big size or if you

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:17,710
cannot appreciate it here and that's why

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:21,430
in that case it's we have lesser

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:24,430
contrast between strokes you better say

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:30,640
this yeah if you put them in at the same

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:33,550
size you notice a difference it's not

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:39,120
only a question of a contrast between

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:44,170
strokes it might be a different aperture

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,570
yes the smaller the smaller the font the

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:51,460
the bigger you can dare to have the

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:56,440
aperture and on the other side if you

00:12:51,460 --> 00:13:00,210
have a big font you can dare to have a

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:04,110
very small aperture it's because

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:09,610
otherwise when it's small let you see

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:13,660
when it's more and you have a small

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:17,340
aperture you may take that latter for

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,340
you know for example

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:24,769
the fourth axis is a slant the slant is

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:29,100
only something that is inclined slanted

00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:36,180
and it's a bit different from what we

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:38,310
know as italic italic is not only a font

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,860
that is slanted but it's something that

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:44,850
has a different history and in a lot of

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:49,380
typefaces we have different shapes for

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,880
the Roman and the italic and since the

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,459
the shapes are very different is not

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,070
possible to have a variation between the

00:13:53,459 --> 00:14:01,260
two an interpolation is technically not

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:03,990
possible so this axis is just a boolean

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:09,029
axis it's either 1 or 0

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:11,910
it's italic or not because of these

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:14,699
constraints in interpolation you have to

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,500
have the same numbers of points defining

00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:23,010
a shape in order to interpolate between

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:26,339
the two oK we've seen five registered

00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:29,940
axes of the traditional typography that

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:33,899
are now in the variable fonts and what

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,449
happens if you combine those axes well

00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:42,560
you can you can be create you the type

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:44,790
designer can be creative and design new

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,130
kind of fonts that we've never seen

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:55,040
before in upright italic or a slanted

00:14:49,130 --> 00:15:00,089
not italic things that I can think of

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:07,350
and this was with only five axes what

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:10,139
about with the extra custom axes look at

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:15,990
this new well it's very new it's freshly

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:17,449
baked in font and we have three trips

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:23,760
between each other

00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:28,620
sorry here we have three traditional

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,649
axes in small cups and two custom axes

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:36,180
one of those is this one is more

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:40,439
axes and this axis transform a SAN serif

00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:45,889
font into a monospaced font something

00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:52,970
weird in the tradition of typography so

00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:56,360
think what can happen with 60 more than

00:15:52,970 --> 00:16:01,110
64,000 custom axis possible into the

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:07,379
variable fonts you can start having

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:14,249
things that change in I don't know how

00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:18,089
many variations and something some some

00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:22,339
designer might think of very new kind of

00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:29,189
axes the number of points shapes that

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:32,189
makes Nafees makes a font or some Leafs

00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:39,240
that grows out of your phone things I

00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:42,240
think but what happens and that to many

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,970
possibilities we as web designer what

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,889
can we do with all these possibilities

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:55,910
shall we become type designers ourselves

00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:59,699
if luckily their format has this

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:03,240
characteristic that their code name

00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:07,319
instances so the type designers can

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:11,779
bring back what we had before the type

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:16,799
designer can choose for you the best

00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:20,610
solutions and put those solutions inside

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:24,959
a font so that you can go on working at

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:27,689
it before using the bold the italic the

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,380
extended version I don't know of the

00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:33,870
font and not something in between you

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:40,020
can use something in between but you

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:43,909
might follow those suggestions so what

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,909
are the advantages of variable fonts

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:55,540
performance performance yes or no in my

00:17:51,730 --> 00:18:02,550
opinion you have to balance the two so

00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:06,400
when you put some web fonts in a website

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:10,840
you generally put some different styles

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:15,280
so you end up with the some of the

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:19,450
weight of all those styles the each

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:25,510
variable font which a one single font

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:28,870
will weight less more will weight less

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:33,600
than the amount of the others with the

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:39,190
static ones so it generally a very good

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:42,790
choice for performance we're talking

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:46,800
about performance and web fonts you

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:50,350
better mmm use some other techniques I

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:53,890
don't have the time to to talk about

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,900
this now but you have to use warf tool

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,420
that's it compress compressed version

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:03,060
you have to make the sub setting maybe

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:07,590
the license of the font allows it and

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:12,970
you have to have a web font loading

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:17,440
practice web practice one of your and

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:24,430
today and now it's coming CSS starting

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:28,270
helping us and another advantage is

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:31,570
bringing back the optical side with into

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:35,800
the history of typography you can make a

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:41,880
fine tuning that's I think the real

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:46,090
advantage you can put all these

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:52,120
possibility inside your your website

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:55,600
just with on file you can another for

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,659
example think to use variable phones to

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,690
adapt to languages

00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:03,340
I make an example to give you an idea if

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:06,950
you have a multi-language site you have

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:10,729
language with long words such as German

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:13,929
for example you can decide to style the

00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:17,749
German version with a more compressed

00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:20,029
web font or if you're French you're

00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:26,330
dealing with the accents for example you

00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:31,039
you adjust that axis and of course they

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:33,019
are a big advantage in the responsive

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,929
web typography or fluid web typography

00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:43,190
as you like allowing for a lot of

00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:46,970
fine-tuning but that comes also some

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:51,619
disadvantages and the first one is the

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:55,820
choice where are they we don't have so

00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:59,659
many variable fonts ready yet on the

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,249
other side there would be another

00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:04,460
disadvantage it would be the price I

00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:09,729
mean okay there are open source open

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:13,039
source fonts but there are a lot of

00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:17,389
fonts that you can buy and in order to

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,759
buy a variable fonts we we should pay

00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:22,519
for the entire family it is going to be

00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,129
at the time being is quite expensive so

00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:28,940
we see what happened in the market in

00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:30,409
the near future then you can have a

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,519
criminal potential that's the

00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:37,249
disadvantage what do I mean it's

00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:39,529
typography a typographic crimes you have

00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:41,659
so many possibilities to use a lot of

00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:43,940
different variations that you should

00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:48,429
have an idea what to do with that so you

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:54,249
might end up doing things not so nice so

00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:54,249
use it with with the project in mind

00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:05,419
implementation just few words on this

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:09,900
you can use different CSS properties for

00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:13,980
the time being low level font

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:17,790
low level CSS property is recommended if

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:20,760
you want to use all of the axis of a

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,890
variable font be careful that they

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,280
overwrite each other so because they are

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:29,580
low level CSS properties in the near

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,800
future we will use this is the

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,020
foundation status but in the near usual

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,490
we will use something that is still in

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:43,980
the CSS for font module recommendation

00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:47,100
and will have different proper CSS

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,900
properties too today with this it may be

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:55,710
disallowed the font faint assisted the

00:22:48,900 --> 00:23:03,870
browser - with that another important

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:07,950
thing is - to have a nice fall back

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:11,670
stack in when you're using web fonts so

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:14,640
you might choose to have variable fonts

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:17,309
but you still need a static one for

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,890
browsers that don't support it but don't

00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:22,890
do it like that that's not the correct

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,960
way to do it the right way to do it this

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,980
is far more better more far more

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,059
progressive a nonsense announcement

00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:34,740
using the add support feature query and

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,550
at the same time if you are hosting

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,690
yourself

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:43,050
besides the cell phones you should have

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,120
the variable version and the static

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:50,309
version as well and do something like

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:53,760
this but good news are coming for those

00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:58,559
that would want to use this technique

00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:08,150
and google fonts API version 2 this is

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:11,309
ready and this new API will allow you to

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:16,020
recall both the variable and the static

00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:19,830
fonts but where can I find the variable

00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:23,279
funds that was a request before

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:27,870
I've used some google fonts early access

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:32,100
but they were experiments or less using

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:39,269
in the example as before but here is the

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:43,010
big new news there are 10 variable fonts

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:47,159
available with the new google fonts API

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:51,539
and they are if you are using one of

00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:55,679
those you can start your experiments

00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:59,130
with the variable phones actually Google

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:05,130
has already done this for you for the

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:08,100
Oswald font read because it is really

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:16,159
better in with with regard to

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:19,830
performance WordPress new theme 2020 is

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:27,330
already using a variable font it's the

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:31,919
inter for asthma Sanderson so you you

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:35,340
might take the same example and find out

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:40,320
what if it helps in the fine tuning of

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:43,769
your websites otherwise if you want to

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,620
find out some other fonts you can check

00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:48,120
your creative software you might have a

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,350
creative software I won't mention but

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,220
maybe you already have those funds at

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:58,260
your disposal

00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:03,230
samo then you can look for phone

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:07,340
distributors or ask your trusted foundry

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:12,210
I'll leave you some tools to play with

00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:16,500
one is access proxies the other the V

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:20,299
phones play type data in those three

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,889
tools you can experiment with the axis

00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,799
this is a very nice store if you want to

00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:30,000
implement it you'll bring you'll drop a

00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:32,039
font and it will show you like that the

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,140
characteristic of the font there are

00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:40,590
some others too like this

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:44,160
this is very nice but let's see what we

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:47,760
can use those variable forms for what

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:51,059
are the potentials in my opinion one of

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:55,549
the interesting potentials of that the

00:26:51,059 --> 00:27:00,000
variable fonts are multimedia interfaces

00:26:55,549 --> 00:27:02,760
you see what happens if you give as an

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,320
input the phone movement for example and

00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:10,020
then you can change some weight or with

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,260
axes okay this is an example is not an

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:19,590
interface but you can give it a meaning

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:24,179
in your design oh this is I cannot show

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:28,350
it let it listen to you you now but you

00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:31,140
can start there's a link there if you

00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:36,450
use the input as an input the Microsoft

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:39,150
the microphone the microphone the font

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:46,500
will change for example if you talk

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:51,179
louder the font get bolder and think

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:55,620
what it that can be in the vocal new

00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:57,660
environment we are going to or you can

00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:02,330
imagine - I don't have an example here

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:05,160
but some some pressure sensor device

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:07,770
changing with the wait for axis for

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:12,740
example or on the other side you can

00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:15,750
have font that adapts to the environment

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,169
that's a very nice it's not register

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:22,110
axis it's called grade in typography

00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:28,350
this is what it does look at the column

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:31,440
at your left you see changes just in the

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,860
color of the font but it doesn't reflow

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,049
it since it doesn't reflow it's very

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:41,880
useful in web design for over effect

00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:43,610
things like that and look at this

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,570
example

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:53,550
if you change the ambient light there

00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:56,550
your computer as the camera is the input

00:28:53,550 --> 00:29:01,200
device and this ax is the grade can

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:07,530
change so if the light changes the font

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:09,090
adapts or you if you have a device that

00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:14,220
can measure your distance from your

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:18,230
screen you can adopt the fonts to the

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:22,770
instance or new environments that

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:26,490
virtual reality or augmented reality you

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:29,340
have to have font in 3d these are type

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,800
designer that announced that one year

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,100
ago what it was when it was that they

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:39,270
were starting from making new phones for

00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:42,300
those new environments and infographics

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:44,940
as well I show you this pen that's

00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:48,840
wonderful for me in infographics it

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:53,210
because let's take big data

00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:58,020
methodological data of each town has

00:29:53,210 --> 00:30:02,880
temperature and the wind and with the

00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:07,200
data and then you adopt for example if

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,650
it's the hotter the font get bolder or

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,340
there's a lot of wind it's most landed

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:16,410
so the infographic is representing big

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:20,430
data could be easy with variable fonts

00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:23,100
or you can think of animations but

00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,810
please give some meaning some semantics

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,410
to your animation not do it just for the

00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:32,100
sake of doing them or for accessibility

00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:34,320
and particular needs I don't know the

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,140
exact SIA for example you can adopt a

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:43,130
lot of things in the typography in order

00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:47,190
to have better reading experiences and

00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:51,120
as last I would like to think of this

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:55,640
expressiveness you can reach there's a

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,940
nice book I've read Oh Sarah Hyneman

00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,530
with

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:06,590
that deals with how the shape with the

00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:13,350
shapes of the fonts might be linked to

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:16,140
emotions so some fun that is very

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:19,560
straight communicate more calm

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:25,560
whereas something that it's slanted is

00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:27,840
more anxious or so you can have play

00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:33,780
with the temperature of your phones you

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:45,420
might have a sort of mood axes thank you

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:49,340
for a attention Thank You Julia very

00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:08,430
something what can we do if you want to

00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:15,420
start doing something and try this

00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:19,860
variable fonts at home I think that with

00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:22,770
the Google Fonts 10 variable fonts

00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,870
available you can start from from that

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:28,350
for example Oh play with the tools I

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:31,950
suggested and start familiarize with

00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:34,980
them because it's going to be something

00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:44,850
that in my opinion will change quite

00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:47,180
fast so get ready line fondo a vicino
