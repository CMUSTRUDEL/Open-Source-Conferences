Description: 
	Being the CMO (chief marketing officer) of Artbees, I have been in the center of all marketing activities in Jupiter WordPress theme that has formed its 130000 user-base in the last 5 years.

00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:15,240
band I am a co-founder and CMO and my

00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:17,520
company art bees we do team we create

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,469
premium WordPress themes I'm going to

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,409
talk about marketing but I'll try to

00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:27,659
explore a different site different

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,409
approach to marketing than the regular

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,240
or classic or commonly known marketing

00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,099
I'm gonna I'm gonna study or look

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:41,039
at marketing from the perspective of

00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:50,009
lean methodology and I'm gonna start

00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:51,929
with the description of marketing well

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,529
it doesn't require description everyone

00:01:51,929 --> 00:02:00,479
knows what marketing is but maybe sergio

00:01:55,529 --> 00:02:03,539
Zaman puts together up like very short

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,319
but efficient a description of marketing

00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:10,619
by saying marketing is more stuff to

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,930
more people for more money more often

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,980
more efficiently this is very general

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,980
but I'm sure holistic

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,350
the thing is that the way you do this I

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,900
mean this can be did the goal this can

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,750
be the destination but how you want to

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,270
achieve this and there are millions of

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,270
different ways to do this and I want to

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,760
look at one specific perspective that is

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:40,190
less covered and is like them let's say

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,810
most modern way of marketing before

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,610
starting to talk about marketing I want

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,630
to say I want to talk about what is not

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:53,330
marketing marketing is not only about

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:56,570
selling a product the process of

00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:00,020
marketing a product does not end when a

00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:02,780
product is sold it actually begins there

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,060
this is how we opposed to the classical

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,710
classic way of marketing when the the

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,520
goal was actually just selling when you

00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:13,580
want to sell coca-cola some water and

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,860
sugar like Steve Jobs says your mission

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,250
is accomplished when you just sell a can

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,930
of coca-cola but the way we we want to

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,560
explore marketing is actually the other

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,080
way around

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,400
it actually starts when you sell the

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,130
product so what is this lean marketing

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,610
we don't want to repeat this jargon word

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:37,280
over and over let's dig in so we

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,860
marketing is derived and kind of

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,110
inspired from a methodology called lean

00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:47,450
startup lean startup can be defined as a

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,770
way of building products around

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:54,670
I mean driven by learning so you can

00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:59,690
just replace the word building by

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:02,420
selling or marketing the learning that

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,090
is the very important aspect in this

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:09,190
methodology is actually a three-fold

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:12,680
model a three-fold process of building

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,360
measuring and learning so you build you

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,299
measure what you built and how it

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:22,640
performs and learn from the results and

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:25,900
then reflects the results in your plans

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,400
for the next stage and this process

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,770
keeps happening it doesn't stop

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,570
and it's starting to stop somewhere it

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:37,490
keeps happening so there there's also a

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,789
word for lean marketing or lean

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,710
methodology there's also a second name

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:46,870
that is quite popular maybe you have

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:49,810
heard this more often its growth hacking

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,800
but these actually are the same thing of

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,590
talking about the same thing

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,050
lean marketing like I said follows the

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,530
very same concept of building around

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:04,820
learning or like I said marketing around

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:09,050
learning so and this process has eight

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:12,320
steps however I have like tweak tweak

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,699
this a little bit and it starts with

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,100
finding MC empathy and then we define

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,949
hypothesis and then we build a small

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:26,360
product based on this hypothesis and

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:29,270
then we measure what we build make

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,030
decision and then pivot or persevere and

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,430
then we try to reach the stickiness we

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,139
try to reach virality and then we start

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,650
to earn money and spend it and enjoy it

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,820
so I'm gonna give it a little expert

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,590
description or explanation of each of

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,659
these steps starting with finding

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:49,820
empathy so what is this all about you

00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:53,539
before you start a product before you

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,460
id8 a product you need to go inside your

00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:59,539
target markets market to markets head

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,820
you should try to solve a problem that

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:05,510
people care about and people would like

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:09,830
to pay for and that is how you are

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:12,770
finding in empathy once you've found

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:16,150
that you need to define a hypothesis

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,159
something you assume is gonna work so

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,710
your product is driven by an intention

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:23,990
like we discussed or something that

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,080
makes you think this product is relevant

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:30,320
and has a right to exist okay so you

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,990
have a hypothesis what you're gonna do

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,639
is are gonna build a very small version

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,409
of what you think is gonna work and what

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,110
you think you what are the thing that

00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:42,930
you think your target market is gonna

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:47,230
enjoy and it solves the problem for them

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:51,640
this small thing that you just that we

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:54,820
just talked about is your Minimum Viable

00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,030
Product that is also called the

00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,230
shortened version is MVP which is going

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,780
to prove or disprove your hypothesis you

00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,400
should think about very essential

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,920
elements without which your product will

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,950
not work so everything else that is not

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,650
essential should be just cut off and

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:16,810
thrown away and then you have this a

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:20,470
small product that you will put in to

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:25,300
test and see how it performs now it's

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:27,250
time to measure measuring is having

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,260
different forms and different ways to

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,910
measure but we're going to focus on the

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:38,650
three most on three major ways which is

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:43,320
analysis interview and experiment so

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:47,350
let's first focus on analysis so

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:51,130
normally we do an analysis this is not a

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:55,240
new thing to talk about but think is the

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:58,540
way you do analysis might suffer some

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,480
problems might lack some wrong

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,900
perspectives firstly the metrics that

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:09,130
you are focusing and trying to measure

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:13,630
should should be comparative not

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,980
absolute for example if you're focusing

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,690
in conversion rate there's a KPI to

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,000
measure the performance you should not

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:23,640
say okay I sold three thousand copies

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,180
today or last month you should say how

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,560
big or how more was my sell or

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,660
conversion rate comparing to the

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,110
previous month or this quarter comparing

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,830
to the previous quarter so you should be

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:41,669
comparative not absolute your metrics

00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:44,770
should be actionable not of vanity

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,600
actionable means it should give you give

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,930
you some insight by which you can make

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,450
decision like saying I have five million

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,220
visitors in a month is not a good KPI

00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,040
because it doesn't give you any insight

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,130
that can drive action

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,770
it should be something insightful or we

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,459
say actionable and also should be

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,720
leading not lagging it should be more

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:08,920
forward-looking than back

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,100
backward-looking

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,760
exploring the past and making decisions

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:20,470
based on the metrics that are solely

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:23,080
looking at the past is is not it's not

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,920
good it's not useful you should focus on

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,620
metrics that are leading and

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,230
forward-looking so with that with these

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,540
factors in mind about the metrics you

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,730
should measure I'm gonna make sure you

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,770
give you some examples of the good KPIs

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,959
or good metrics to focus when you're

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:44,649
measuring your performance it's for

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,029
example uptime and reliability revenue

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:52,740
per customer churn rates upselling

00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:56,950
stickiness enrollment conversion rate

00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:00,160
lifetime value virality and very

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,230
importantly customer acquisition cost so

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,899
these were some examples there for sure

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,170
or more and then we have a second way of

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:11,500
measuring the performance which is

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,980
interview and is this is very commonly

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:18,070
being forgotten and the marketing is

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,870
fear you should remember that you should

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,000
talk to your users and their experiences

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:26,380
with your product well this many of us

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,450
can confirm and you should ask them what

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,700
they do like and what they don't like

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,990
about your product and what they what

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,970
improvements they want so that about the

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,560
second form the third way is doing

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,810
experiment and maybe is the most

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,890
important even more important than

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:47,079
analysis so experimenting is like this

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,810
if you want to put it put it very simple

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:55,660
in a simple way you believe feature X

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:58,029
will improve the metric Y by a specific

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,339
percentage and this is an assumption so

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:03,700
you have to experiment it this is a very

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:07,720
simple you know formula for

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,910
experimenting and this statement

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,830
actually is like the hypothesis

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,050
we just talk but it's a very shorter

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:18,160
version of that so experimentation is

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:21,160
the only way to prove or disprove it the

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,140
other form the one major form of testing

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,240
is a split testing many of you might

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,580
have heard already and it's when you

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,470
define cohorts of users and then

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,710
experiment new features and marketing

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:37,210
campaigns to those different courts we

00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:39,250
also have a B testing which is actually

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:42,040
when we are comparing one attribute such

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,410
as link color and anything else and

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,480
assuming everything else is equal we're

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,760
doing a/b testing so just one element

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,190
isn't is put in the testing however we

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,890
have more complicated way of a B testing

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,420
which is multivariate testing but this

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,580
is the first maybe this is the easiest

00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,920
and simplest thing to begin when you are

00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,540
trying to assess your product

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,220
performance so after doing these

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,670
measurements these three forms of

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,810
measurement that we just discuss we need

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,170
to make decision that's a very

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:14,950
historical moment we have to you know

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:18,130
deal with and that's when you pivot or

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,540
persevere so for those of you who don't

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,080
know the meaning of these two words

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:25,390
pivot is like staying the path sorry

00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,610
persevere means that staying in the path

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,080
that you are in and it actually shows

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,830
that you're in the right direction and

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:36,420
pivot is the other is the opposite which

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:39,340
means you have to change your direction

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:42,850
so if the measurement results was

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,800
aligned with your goal it means that

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,610
your hypothesis is proven and you may

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,160
persevere in the path you are in but if

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,890
the result of the measurement is

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,510
negative and not as expected then it's

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,360
time to pivot towards another direction

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:01,000
and restart from step one so those of us

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,790
who hit this scenario we have to go back

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,940
to step one of this formula and those of

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,700
us who don't and we prove our hypothesis

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,140
we can continue and that's where we

00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,340
should start working on this kind of

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,190
things reaching a stickiness well as you

00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,410
can guess from the meaning stickiness is

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,000
like making your users making your

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,120
audience or target market stick to your

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,240
product or service

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,529
more and more you see there is nothing

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,750
about making money at the moment so if

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,400
your MVP is vindicated it's time to

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,529
focus on increasing your users

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,810
engagement with your product like I said

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:44,839
so for example two metrics or average

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:47,000
stats that you can consider as the write

00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,570
in the standard way to show that your

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,140
product

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,820
having the right stickiness is the term

00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,310
rate if your churn rate is five less

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,100
than five percent and also the time

00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,720
spent in your product depending on what

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,279
kind of product you're selling this web

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,570
application it's a mobile application

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:08,690
this might change different emits a day

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,880
is like an average amount you can

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,610
consider like I said this is very

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,040
relative changes from sector to sector

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:20,260
and product product but these can be

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,610
like the ballpark ballpark figures so

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:26,240
after the stickiness we need to think

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:28,220
about how to increase virality there are

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,900
different ways of or different forms of

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:35,680
virality inherent virality artificial

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,300
virality and word-of-mouth virality

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,970
inherent where reality happens happens

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,459
when happens naturally within the

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,410
product and a good example is envision

00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:48,170
because of you have worked you designers

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:51,200
and you know designers might know the

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,529
service so you have to you prototype of

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,570
products to your client or your

00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:59,390
colleagues and you invite them to

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,160
envision and they automatically see the

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,410
service the third-party service does is

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,630
actually making this prototype happen so

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:11,360
that's inherently you know wire wider

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,570
this has this viral virality mechanism

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,060
built right inside the product but we

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:20,690
also have artificial virality which is

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:24,890
incentivized incentive i incentivized

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:27,020
and less genuine and best example is

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,140
dropbox you know dropbox was about to

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,900
collapse and the only way they could

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,740
survive and actually became this big was

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,930
their referral mechanism that

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,750
I remember they used to give you like a

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,399
couple months of free usage or learn a

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,690
couple gigabytes of free storage

00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:49,279
so that's Dropbox that's incentivized

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,600
referral program we also have

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,420
word-of-mouth refer a referral system or

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,520
royality mechanism which has a lot of

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,470
examples to give I don't need to mention

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,709
you see all of the wireless stories and

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:08,060
campaigns that is just viral without any

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:10,279
specific element or a good example of

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,410
this it's just people talk about it and

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,860
I can say it's the most effective and

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:23,080
trust worthy kind of referring a product

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:25,520
to a person so after we reach this

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:31,209
stickiness and virality it's time for

00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:34,300
making money and scale so if you start

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:37,730
monetizing your product after you have

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:40,430
made your users stick to you and you

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:43,459
have made the viral product then it's

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:47,300
time to charge them and if your customer

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:49,550
acquisition cost which is CAC is less

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,800
than a third third of your customer

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,140
lifetime value it means that you earn

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,510
you're doing a good job and the

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,399
monetization or this step of making

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,140
revenue is actually happening in the

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,600
right way however this is a very general

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:09,800
you know example this might change but

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,540
like I said this can be a good figure to

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:17,689
consider for the beginning so all right

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:20,270
now after this I have just I have been

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:23,510
more talking about more theoretical

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:26,179
facts than practical by telling you what

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,700
is lean methodology and there's

00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:32,480
different steps the eight steps I want

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:35,210
to show you the actual examples or the

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,990
practical way we can make use of this

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,390
idea and this methodology into marketing

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,640
and specifically when working in

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,050
WordPress and just reproducing any

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,050
WordPress product or service

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:55,970
so we talked about analysis whatever

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,220
product or service you're building and

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,049
you're trying to market you make sure

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,540
you prepare a report with Google Data

00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:04,910
studio and collect the metrics that you

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,130
that you you think that matters to you

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,070
and watch them on daily weekly monthly

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:14,390
and quarterly basis that's what what I

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:16,340
do as well always increase your theme

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,049
speed and performance so many people do

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,400
not consider this a marketing thing and

00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:21,200
more of a development thing but I think

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,980
it's more of a marketing thing because

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,169
if your demo pages for example are loads

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,960
for a first-time visitor in less than 5

00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:32,870
seconds and it lasts more than 10

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,740
seconds you are in a bad situation and

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:39,919
you don't want that experiment

00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,500
everything like we discussed you can

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,280
experiment templates if you're a team

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,380
producer like us all the features

00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,580
regardless of the kind of product that

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,230
you're building the pricing all the

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,360
campaign's marketing campaigns like

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,760
promotions discounts and offers

00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,429
everything can be put into testing there

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,350
should be no you should not be certain

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,480
about anything about your marketing

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,010
everything can be surprised you can

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,350
surprise you when you put them into

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:13,880
testing this happens this has happened

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:17,150
to me a lot throughout my career so how

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,520
do you actually conduct the testing you

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,880
first like we said define hypothesis and

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,679
a cohort for it release an MVP with the

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,720
hypothetic feature for that cohort or

00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,990
the other ways of testing a B test two

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,870
features for one cohort and and of

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,690
course expand if successful pivot if not

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,419
successful this very important thing

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,700
which is more about maybe PR but no I

00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:45,380
think it's it's directly related to

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,169
marketing is how you should stay

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,660
connected to your customer and your

00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,790
community you should interact with

00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,549
customers we have support or sales

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,559
channels every day yourself and that's

00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,630
how you know them I let them know you

00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,130
you should not instead you should not

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,740
delegate your market research

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,770
two third parties or middleman companies

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,300
like many big companies do and that's a

00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,150
bad practice you should interview them

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,520
yourself and preferably with FaceTime

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,860
not even buddy email you can actually

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,940
[Music]

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,560
incentivize this thing with them I don't

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,340
I give them an Amazon gift card or

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:26,120
iTunes gift card like many companies do

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,310
now affiliate program this is directly a

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,030
girl thanking method affiliate program

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:34,550
or customer loyalty programs why because

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,040
if every single user successfully

00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,830
invites more than one other paying user

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,200
your growth is almost assured one

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:45,250
perform this is I guess there's also a

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,730
name for this virality coefficient

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:52,340
figure which is the example of you know

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,210
a good business doing the referral

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,620
program or loyalty program the right way

00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,810
for example you can define discount

00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,690
Tires based on the number of users that

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:04,420
one user refers this is also what

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,530
Dropbox did like we discussed

00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,420
promotional campaigns promotional

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:12,230
campaigns are what everyone does if you

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,780
don't you will fail according to our

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:18,400
expert experience you can run one

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:22,750
promotional campaign per quarter maybe

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,950
forty to sixty percent discount or

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,050
subscription based on the business model

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:31,850
you have in Black Friday which is

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:35,390
upcoming and one interesting thing is

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:41,120
that huge you can consider never

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:43,940
charging your customers for hosting how

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,760
if you are an independent seller don't

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,680
charge your users for hosting you can

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,410
add it to your theme price or service

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:56,090
price and then advertise as free hosting

00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:59,720
this is a scientific practice and I can

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:03,320
you know mention of course after this

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,970
interview it was like an experiment and

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,740
it actually worked like this people were

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:12,560
more interested in the you know the

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,870
false advertisement we should say so

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,900
this is

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,870
one growth hacking practice good to

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,890
provide as example blogging we don't

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:27,710
need to talk about this this is like

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:30,380
Yvonne I was saying saying content is a

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:33,770
king so yes content is the steel king

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,680
you need to blog you need to do the

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,510
content marketing but let me give you

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,490
some shortcuts about blogging use

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:43,460
keyword planner have Adwords Keyword

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,800
planner or buzzsumo to find the trends

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,750
in your industry I mean our industry in

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,630
WordPress industry and blog about them

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:55,580
that will cut down a lot of like work

00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,910
and inefficient blogging so how long do

00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,809
I have

00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,160
okay how much this is very interesting I

00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:03,440
actually did this experiment it was

00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,460
really really efficient and surprisingly

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,400
good run competitor Google ad campaigns

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,090
what does it mean you should find your

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,740
computer's weakness or weaknesses and

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,240
show how you address them with your

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,210
product in a landing page so you build

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,800
this landing page and then you should

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,620
run ad word campaigns with your

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,480
competitors keyword and link them to

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,760
that landing page this is pretty evil

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,220
but this is very efficient I know

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,860
intercom or many of the companies doing

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:39,710
this actually how I got inspired from

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:44,270
them so implement added value or fake it

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:47,030
do we more transparent if working on a

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:50,929
marketplace you can add Amazon giftcard

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:52,640
incentive file incentivize this you your

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,070
customer different ways that you can

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,929
like I said Amazon gift card or you can

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,390
if you're an independent seller working

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:02,120
not in the marketplace like we do you

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,010
can you provide included hosting the way

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,420
we discussed you should just advertise

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:10,820
it as a free and added value and then

00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,740
when you do it test it with one cohort

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,740
and expanding success successful you

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,360
don't want to regret risking I don't

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,700
know something like this spending a lot

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,380
of money and this incentives and then

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,350
you regret it you can just like I said

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,179
do the MVP define hypothesis make MVP

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,770
release it look at the product and how

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,700
it would look at the result and how it

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,940
performs and then

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,640
decide if you want to expand it or not

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:36,800
go GPL well maybe you don't know I mean

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,010
maybe it's surprising but going GPL is

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,330
actually gross I can method why you

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,200
should give your users the freedom to

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:47,630
use your product however they like and

00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,570
GPL helps you build trust stickiness and

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:52,400
virality all at once so maybe this is

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,740
the only marketing practice or a very

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,590
few among the very few that gives that

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,590
has all of these engines of growth at

00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:05,360
the same time stickiness and virality as

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:07,670
well as trust worthiness okay so our

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,080
product Jupiter X is a freemium GPL

00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,870
WordPress theme with a hundred and three

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:15,230
thirty thousand plus user customers so

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:17,030
it means GPL is not the suicide and we

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,670
have done this we have risked this and

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:22,430
we don't regret it

00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:25,040
this is very important which is building

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:26,690
an investing time to build your public

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,210
image you don't want to be a developer

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,160
of working in a cave all the time and

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,960
just release a product and charge people

00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,640
to that make your build yourself a

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,800
public image which is very important

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,260
nowadays whether you're an independent

00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,210
seller a SAS provider or a marketplace

00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,890
seller you should get out of your cave

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,710
and go to work camps as simple as that

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:51,920
you can sponsor your cities or one of

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,950
the continental war camps yeah you

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,230
should talk and share your experiment

00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:01,010
experience with with the community these

00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:01,310
are all are getting practices and that's

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,200
it

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,910
poly Bibles of lean methodology are

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,580
these three books and I in definitely

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,890
recommend the lean analytics by eric

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,510
wise the same author for lean startup

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,120
and the growth hacker marketing and

00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:20,380
that's it thanks for your time

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:30,620
[Applause]

00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:32,360
some questions just one what a surprise

00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,910
first of all I would like to tell you

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,640
great talk very interesting

00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:40,700
Monsieur and what I would like to tell

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:47,450
you is that in the last week's F search

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:50,780
for Adwords Keyword and as different

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:55,520
agents different Google agent told me

00:26:50,780 --> 00:27:01,160
they are they have closed that first it

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:03,110
was second question is no second

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,090
question just I didn't get your first

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,550
question I think yeah it's not the first

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:11,240
it's a it's a I just say it's an

00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:15,470
information question all right so my

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:20,180
question instead is do you think that

00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:27,020
this I think is great what you said but

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:33,530
what about if for example we we we don't

00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:36,080
have an idea or if we are you not using

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:39,860
a system of press mm I'm selling t-shirt

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:49,240
and I have a problem because actually no

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:53,420
one well not so small part of my people

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:56,570
people buy it so I just 200 I'm just

00:27:53,420 --> 00:28:01,640
understanding how can I do for improve

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:06,800
that but what I found is that is that is

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,780
so my question was just just this so do

00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,940
you think that if I don't have enough

00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:15,290
that data how can I do the work yeah you

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,770
don't have enough data then you should

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:21,140
do a lot of guesswork or they say God

00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:24,800
fork right you have to just make

00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,750
assumptions based on no no facts and no

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,950
figures and then put them into testing

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,450
sometimes they work because there are

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,960
some people who says

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:35,269
guesswork works better in marketing but

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,510
if you want to take the less risky way

00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:40,700
and a more reliable way you should find

00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,019
metrics you should define metrics you

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,760
should look at those numbers if you

00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:46,370
don't have those numbers it's very risky

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,809
to make decisions without like very

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,899
essential metrics such as conversion

00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:52,549
rate or engagement rate and such you

00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:55,220
will have a very very dark way ahead of

00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:56,809
you dark path ahead of you so it's very

00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,679
important to find those define those

00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:02,179
metrics and find the value before you

00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:12,019
make decisions for the future of your

00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:14,269
product or service great presentation

00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,010
really really appreciate it never heard

00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:16,669
about lean methodology learned a lot

00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,350
today

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:23,600
how is easy is it to implement it when

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,769
you have a marketing team that has

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,710
different backgrounds and different

00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:29,419
things and because I gather in your

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:33,740
companies kind of easy because you're a

00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:35,269
guy and you're defining the road but

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,649
like in a marketing company for some of

00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,659
the clients that I deal with

00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,010
I can probably think that somebody's

00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:42,200
read the book and like okay gung-ho

00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:45,320
we're going in with this and everybody

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,059
else is kind of like okay well so I

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,039
would just want to understand that yeah

00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:52,700
the short answer is it's very difficult

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,039
yeah it's very difficult and it takes a

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,830
lot of work maybe it won't be as

00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,380
productive and rewarding in the

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,120
beginning as you expect if you read

00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,399
these books there's a lot of stories the

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,159
similar people who have been part of a

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,440
big company I don't have like coca-cola

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,080
and such they had a hard time making the

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,330
bus's understand the value of this

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,409
methodology so for sure there there is

00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:19,399
some you know resistance against it in

00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,710
the beginning but it will be very

00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:23,139
rewarding at the end but also it doesn't

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,340
need to be applied like you say

00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:28,519
immediately and all at once like we go

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,190
home and tomorrow we do lean it's a it's

00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,130
a it can be a very very gradual and

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:37,760
transitional process you can start

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:41,870
applying these practices one by one over

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,030
time so a culture is cultivated or and

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,710
fostered

00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,110
during the process but if you just give

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,420
this I don't know the leader the Board

00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,650
of Directors this as a package for sure

00:30:50,420 --> 00:31:07,010
there will be problem there will be

00:30:51,650 --> 00:31:11,360
resisting first of all I really

00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:14,960
appreciate your speech and I read the

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,700
book and it's incredible I have never

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,770
read something like that and growth

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,710
marketing growth hacking is something

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:29,780
that I think that we have to focus on

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:37,390
and so my question is can I see another

00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:39,500
one time the part of Google Ad technique

00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:48,860
I don't remember

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:53,930
mmm you want to review it yeah yeah yes

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:55,460
yes this technique yes

00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,590
just because you talked about the

00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:01,510
affiliate program to run an affiliate

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:05,540
program and for example we we have seen

00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:08,680
Dropbox when I when you say athlete

00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,340
program I think about draw box or also

00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,150
today

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:20,450
tik-tok social network that create

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:24,260
awareness and expand the market share

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:26,720
just for that I have never seen it's my

00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:31,820
first time that I've seen this technique

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:35,570
do you have an example the practice the

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,160
practical practical example like Dropbox

00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,940
sure yeah I have a very good example

00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:44,060
which is intercom an ocean and many

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,130
modern like many new startups and

00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:50,660
companies are doing this so there are

00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:52,880
like many old and like classic products

00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,400
to solve a problem and there is young

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,210
startup who is doing it the same thing

00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,970
but

00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,129
efficient and less custody way and they

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,860
do this thing they just target them with

00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:07,639
their own keyword and then put together

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,950
a good landing page which actually shows

00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:11,749
to those who consider the old product

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,360
wide they are better than them and

00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:16,759
intercom was actually the one who you

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:25,840
know inspired me for this and that's was

00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:29,090
how I got to know intercom I actually

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,460
made a research and I said I'm looking

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,769
for product XY intercom comes up and

00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,570
then when I enter the landing page it's

00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:39,230
not the usual landing but you start

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,909
there I mean a normal home page it's how

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,769
it's exactly the points they are

00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:44,629
different or better than the product X

00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:47,450
it means that they have tailored this

00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:50,179
landing page for those who find this

00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,879
from searching for the keyword related

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:54,889
to that product the product X and I

00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:59,389
found this is a very efficient way and

00:33:54,889 --> 00:34:01,570
that's why I listed it yeah you're

00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:01,570
welcome

00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:21,430
yeah hi very interesting top and so you

00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:23,680
address this as about making themes or

00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:26,560
stuff for internally for WordPress right

00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,690
yes yes that's right but it's actually

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,940
also applicable to just to website

00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:36,310
absolutely any additional or different

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,680
thing you would say about that or what

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:42,370
the whole structure of the eight points

00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:45,580
is fully logic absolutely you're right

00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,960
yeah I just wanted to ask since the

00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,210
community and the audience here is more

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,450
focused towards WordPress I wanted to

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:55,390
say it specifically can be applied to

00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:58,600
WordPress as a software and product but

00:34:55,390 --> 00:35:00,520
yes any product actually I think in fact

00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,640
in general it's generally applicable

00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,410
absolutely yes this methodology and

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,240
philosophy and culture cannot be applied

00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,450
to any product or service I just

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,650
WordPress related ones Thanks

00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,650
okay welcome thank you too

00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,970
so hi Masey and thank you for your talk

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,529
it's a pleasure always to area I have a

00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:31,579
question it's quite complicated in fact

00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:34,369
I do not expect the complete answer I'm

00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:37,279
in the Tokyo applied the lean method

00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:38,930
basically to WordPress themes and I

00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:41,390
think it can be applied also to

00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:45,440
WordPress by click plugins now my

00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:50,930
question is if you could choose one of

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:56,569
the steps of the lean methodology for

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:59,150
applying to the WordPress core because

00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:02,180
yesterday you was you were the lead of

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:05,650
the marketing team and I think that the

00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:08,599
marketing team the marketing team at the

00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:12,680
WordPress is not applying lean

00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:16,010
methodology what do you think marketing

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,160
key team and we as a community can take

00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,619
from the lean methodology and apply to

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,990
market WordPress as a whole very good

00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:27,200
question thank you for that I think I

00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:30,069
will go with the experimentation I think

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,240
that's one missing factor or not enough

00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:37,099
considered and used in WordPress

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,069
environment an ecosystem not much of

00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:43,579
experimentation is happening on releases

00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:45,099
I guess the best example was I guess

00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,990
Gutenberg given to I support that

00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:49,579
decision and I liked that editor and it

00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:53,390
was already late for it anything

00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:55,789
I supported but I think releases or the

00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,650
features that are being released and

00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:00,130
provided to the community are not put

00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,569
into testing this a be testing different

00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:05,079
features for different communities based

00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:07,339
on each preferences and the factors that

00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:09,710
separate them from each other I think

00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:12,259
that could be that is actually missing

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,599
and could be very rewarding if we had it

00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:15,799
in WordPress

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:22,509
ecosystem especially in the WordPress

00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:22,509
core but very good question thank you

00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:30,370
thank you for your talk I have a

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,180
question about one of the step that

00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:38,800
mentioned to conduct interviews so is

00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:42,820
that asking the users about what they

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:47,170
think of the MVP and what may be future

00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:50,290
requests they they should add okay what

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:53,410
is the interview step so if you are

00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,300
getting a feature request more

00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,460
frequently so let's say you have a

00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,130
feature requests page or its form and

00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,320
you receive 20 features and five of them

00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,300
are the same so you know that you have

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,100
two candidates that one with five

00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,230
frequency and one with three frequency

00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:11,410
so you can define hypotheses around this

00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:13,780
and put them into testing and then you

00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:16,090
can measure with one of those three ways

00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:19,450
like interviewing to those who ask for

00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:21,730
it as well as maybe other users and then

00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:25,690
looking at the metrics which is analysis

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:27,610
step and also the the experiment that we

00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:31,030
talked about so that is how you can

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:33,990
prove or disprove are the actual good

00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:38,040
that it feature does to your product if

00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,040
I have addressed your question

00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:44,080
absolutely absolutely the thing is that

00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,570
you should not say okay this product is

00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,910
selling and these metrics like CAC

00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,460
should be one third of the CLV and stuff

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,770
so I'm good to go forever no that's not

00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,410
the case it's a very competitive market

00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,480
every day there are no solutions so this

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:03,090
process of building around learning

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:08,910
should infinitely continue thank you to

00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:17,219
the last one it's fine thank you so much

00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:17,219
