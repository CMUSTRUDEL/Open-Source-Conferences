Title: Monique Dubbelman: Why you Should Learn How to Code, even if you don’t Fancy a Coding Career
Publication date: 2020-02-14
Playlist: WordCamp Milano 2019
Description: 
	This year, Monique took the challenge of #100DaysOfCode. But why? Is she new to code? Does she need to learn code as a designer in the first place? And what does it behold? Is it a fixed format?
In this talk, she’ll explain what #100DaysOfCode is and why she took the challenge. She also challenges you to join, even though you don’t fancy a career as a frontend or backend developer.

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,390
caught by the by by the accessibility

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,640
virus so she thinks she's really

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,299
important to build accessible websites

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,259
and today she's going to talk has about

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:48,869
her experience with 100 days of code

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:52,409
project a challenge and she will explain

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:55,259
why we should all take her chance with

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,270
coding even if we don't fancy a real

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,829
career in coding but why this is

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:06,140
important why we should challenge

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:06,140
ourselves in this so money thank you

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:15,740
[Applause]

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:18,950
so I am gratzi that's sort of all I can

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,010
say I practiced a sentence in Italian

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,459
and it'sa my speaker notes but this play

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,870
is being a bit difficult so you get sort

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,020
of the spoiler on the left

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,830
don't look at that so hundred days of

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,930
what a hundred days of code and as Alice

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:39,350
explained this is my talk about why you

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,019
should learn how to code and if you're

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,870
expecting any code in this talk sorry

00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:47,090
there won't be any lines of code so I'm

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:58,360
hoping I hope you don't have

00:02:47,090 --> 00:03:01,610
expectations instead let's see so first

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,610
I'd like to learn what my audience is

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,069
you're probably fed up with raising your

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,950
hands at conferences I'm always like oh

00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:14,269
here we go again but I want to know it

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,579
anyway so sorry about that and excuse me

00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:20,600
for a bit of stereotype drawing I've

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:25,489
been doing I'd like to know who is a

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:34,880
developer in this room good quite a few

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:37,430
and any designers in the house yeah we

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:47,540
probably have some other cool cats in a

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:49,730
house were all cool cats right so yeah

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,609
this talk is about my journey on why I

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,340
wanted to learn how to code and I don't

00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:56,650
know if any of you been to work in

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,200
Europe in Paris

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:05,060
that was my second big word camp I went

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:08,209
to and I learned HTML before there was

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:13,070
CSS so there I gave a bit away about my

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:15,680
age I started really really on and but I

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,489
really liked HTML CSS but I sort of

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,440
abandoned

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,150
because at some point where you've got

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,910
all the different devices with the

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,430
different screen sizes designing for the

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,490
web got really frustrating for me and I

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,229
decided to focus more on content and the

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,180
purpose of a website because you can

00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:35,150
have good design good code but if the

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:38,660
content is not useful or not interesting

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,970
it's it's just a vessel let's be honest

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,810
I mean we make our money with it most of

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,789
us but it's a vessel to get a message

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:51,500
across so I've been really focusing on

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:55,220
that a lot but when I learned about CSS

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:59,659
grid in 2016 or 2017 I think it was I

00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,479
was like oh I love this and it I come

00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:04,880
from a graphical background so I was in

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,220
the printing industry and I could

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,599
certainly relate to the technique of CSS

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:14,090
grid but I kept saying for a year a year

00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,680
and a half I really loved CSS great but

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,360
that doesn't get you anywhere just

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,539
loving it it's not that you wake up the

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,210
next day and you know how to use it the

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:25,699
other thing is that when I applied

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,800
themes to websites in WordPress

00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:30,919
I sometimes get really frustrated

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,550
because I understand the CSS I know what

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:38,599
to change and then nothing happens it's

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:42,050
like okay what did I do wrong so that

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:47,169
was frustrating for me as well then

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,169
finding time to learn or making time

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:57,650
technique okay should be good I have to

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,380
do that every now and then not talk too

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,569
much um yeah finding time to learn

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,430
something new is also difficult as well

00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,240
because before you know it you're at the

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,539
end of the day again

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,550
and then there's so many roars resources

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:17,120
that are on the internet I really didn't

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:20,360
know where to start so that was sort of

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,819
like why I started this whole thing so

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,189
here's a little bit about me so I

00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:29,479
Monique I'm

00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:31,619
now proudly call myself a UX designer

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,830
because I'm not a very good visual

00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:38,939
designer so I didn't dare to call myself

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,830
a designer but UX is really my thing I

00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,809
love to make things usable and I'm

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,499
actually focusing and shifting towards

00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:48,629
that more and more I also teach a

00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:51,269
part-time teach at the local university

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:53,819
and Amsterdam I do that for two months a

00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:58,529
year and I do that on WordPress content

00:06:53,819 --> 00:07:00,479
management prototyping and I coach teach

00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:02,699
like individual clients who want to

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,519
build their own websites so that's when

00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,409
I put on my cape so because they usually

00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,879
see you as a hero that you know so much

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,729
and they learn so much from you so

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,550
that's really great to do that and when

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:18,749
I'm not working I'm a gardener and I'm a

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:28,229
crazy cat lady - I wear my cat socks

00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:29,699
today that's the first thing I get a

00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:33,749
first time I get an applause for that

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:37,259
but I'm happy with it I'll show them a

00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:38,729
bit more we'll give you a good vibe -

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,919
morning

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:45,269
so this is where it all started January

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:47,369
2019 and I had a week off and I was on

00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:50,219
Twitter if you follow me on Twitter you

00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:52,589
know I'm on Twitter a lot and and there

00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:55,559
was this thing called hundred days of

00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:59,729
code and it said this new year's

00:07:55,559 --> 00:08:01,740
resolution will change your life learn

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,959
to code with a hundred days of code and

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,119
here before I've been picking up things

00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,979
every now and then but abandoned it and

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:10,740
I was gonna like oh I saw people do this

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:13,079
and I'm gonna commit to that so that's

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,789
what I did I threw out a tweet because

00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,249
when you commit on the side they prepare

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:20,099
the suite for you and say like join me

00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:23,339
for a hundred days of code so it was out

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,819
in the open I was gonna do it but what

00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:31,110
was I gonna do I didn't know it really I

00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:33,899
just commit it and actually it is what

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,819
you make of it there's this Canadian guy

00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,370
his name is in my speaker notes that I

00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:39,349
can't see right now but

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,070
you can read it on my website I'll share

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:46,310
the links afterwards and he sort of made

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:50,450
this up and it's actually coding for one

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:56,360
hour for a hundred days that's it that's

00:08:50,450 --> 00:09:00,350
the only two rules he made it's not that

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:04,790
strict I'll cut back later and this is

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:07,400
sort of my five things on how I started

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,100
doing this so the first thing is you

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,260
have to set a clear learning goal you

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,730
have to find a course or a resource that

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:21,020
you want to follow find or maybe more

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,400
important make time to do it and post

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,610
your progress to Twitter with the

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:28,820
hashtag and the last one I should have

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,680
made that very big you need to have fun

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,260
doing it because it makes it so much

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,260
easier to keep doing it

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,660
so the first thing choosing your

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:55,810
learning goal for me I mentioned it

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,140
before CSS great was my main goal I

00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:02,050
really wanted to learn that PHP for me

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,610
was like mmm I'm more like front-end is

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,970
more connected to what I'm doing on a

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:09,460
daily base CSS well yeah that was the

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,810
way to go obviously Jeff was great

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:18,960
hmm maybe later so I started learning

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,960
CSS and particularly looked at CSS grids

00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,360
so the second thing is where are you

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,640
gonna find some information to learn

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,610
this I don't know if you're familiar

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,520
with free code camp but it's a great

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,400
resource for learning coding they've got

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,110
really tiny snippets and they walk you

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,430
through and you get extra information

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,470
every time but for me that at some point

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:51,010
didn't really work it was easy for me to

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,350
abandon and I forgot about it again

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,300
I started beginning this year with a

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,790
udemy course there's lots of things out

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:03,970
there and I did this course by Jonas

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:06,460
madman on advanced CSS and sass and he

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,920
also taught me flexbox and CSS create

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,040
and it's amazing the information they

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,200
give you for only ten euros a course and

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,170
you can do it over and over again so

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,440
that was my starting point I also know

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,180
people find our resources on github but

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,940
that's more like self-disciplined you

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,800
have to read and find your things so for

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,440
me udemy was really good because I had

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,640
the short snippets and they expanded

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:37,900
from there so it's a personal preference

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:42,130
but you can also do to learn new things

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:44,740
is go to meetups contribute today's word

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:48,040
camps so get your all here you're

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,710
learning new stuff this weekend and what

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,650
I also did to find resources is you can

00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,279
go on Twitter if you see someone posting

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,370
updates

00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,920
this is a topic I want to learn just ask

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,509
like what course are you doing where

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,249
you're learning this and people are

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:16,480
happy to share I get these questions as

00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:18,569
well so that that might be a research my

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,999
presentation is not on my side today

00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:27,870
it's I'm sorry about this usually I'm

00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:27,870
very professional with this as you know

00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:36,699
they got mixed up as well well it'll be

00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:40,420
good I think I was left at number three

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:43,180
finding time and this is the most

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,720
difficult thing because everybody has

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,749
their own daily habits there are things

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,180
they need to do besides working or just

00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:55,540
work to make money this doesn't bring

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,279
you any money and so that one hour of

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,290
coding a day when are you gonna do it

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,790
are you gonna do it in the evening but

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,059
you might be tired or you've got a

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:06,550
partner who wants attention as well you

00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:08,139
need to finish this Netflix series that

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,300
you just started and then need to binge

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:14,259
watching till 2:00 in the morning so

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:17,529
it's hard to find or make time I can't

00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:19,720
tell you the ideal formula for that but

00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:22,420
for me it works when I do it first thing

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,120
when I get behind my desk I don't open

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,550
my email I don't open social media I

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,000
keep my phone off and I do it the first

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:34,480
hour so I don't get distracted that

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,509
works for me and and then after an hour

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,939
I turn on everything and I've realized I

00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:43,750
haven't really lost any time because I

00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:47,069
know because I have one hour less circle

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:50,379
for my working day I'm more focused and

00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:53,709
I'm more productive so I don't know

00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:55,749
about you but nobody I know talking from

00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:58,509
my own experience is productive for

00:13:55,749 --> 00:14:00,550
eight hours day straight on so you can

00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:03,540
you know miss that one hour

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,540
definitely

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:12,120
this is the easy part you post your

00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,310
progress to Twitter you don't have to do

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,530
it that's the idea about this challenge

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:22,820
is that you do and that holds you

00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:26,640
accountable for your updates it also

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:30,110
helps you to see your progress because

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:33,360
when I now see my update from their five

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,760
I'm like oh I've come a long way since

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,210
then I'm really proud of myself to see

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,270
what I've learned every day so it's it's

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:45,230
for me it's good to do it and to put it

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,060
out in the open like I said it helps you

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:52,590
be accountable for what you do when

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,510
people respond to that and this is a

00:14:52,590 --> 00:15:03,180
very important thing I'll get back to

00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:05,310
that later you need to have fun learning

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,300
things new things is amazing

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:13,560
it's really good to do it inspires you

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:16,290
it's for me it opens my head I wished I

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,970
had exploited that a bit more when I

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,700
could do it full-time when I still live

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,940
with my parents but yeah it's it's

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:31,140
really fun to learn new things so enjoy

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:34,200
that now we're getting to the why I'm

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:38,910
not really bored it's not that I have to

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:41,100
fill my days and so at Christmas I

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,690
started baking my own bread it's not

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,180
that I do that all day but it's good

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,790
it's a nice thing to do I like to garden

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,060
as I said before so I like to spend some

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,710
time away from a computer I like to have

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,270
a glass of wine every now and then I

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:58,200
mean you can't type with one glass of

00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:00,750
wine in your hands that's yeah I like to

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,630
do nothing it's hard but I like to do

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,640
nothing as well I like to do drawing I

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,980
learned to draw earlier this year to do

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,060
sketchnoting and these slides were for

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,580
me the reason to practice that

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,560
um I like to read every now and then so

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:21,490
where do I put this coding in my

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:24,100
schedule what why am I doing this the

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,370
first thing is it it helps me become a

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,260
better designer it inspires me I look at

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:32,080
things from a new perspective if I get

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,390
new ideas looking at possibilities that

00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,150
are well things that are possible on the

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,250
web so if I look at that I'm just like

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,530
oh I get all these new ideas so I get

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:51,760
really inspired by learning new

00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:54,790
techniques I think one of the most

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:58,180
important things to learn code when

00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:00,640
you're not a programmer yourself for me

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:06,130
is to have better communication and

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:08,170
understanding of how developers work you

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,910
speak the same language like it's hard

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,580
for me to communicate with you if you

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:16,180
don't understand English and the other

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:19,090
way around if you would only speak

00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,760
Italian to me I like puzzles so it's

00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:23,860
good that I'm Dutch you're Italian and

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,500
we have English as a common language or

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:30,700
if you could at least say who you Martha

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,840
in Dutch you're wishing me good morning

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,080
buongiorno

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,090
so yeah you understand what the person

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,070
means so for me learning how to code I

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,080
get a better understanding of what

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,450
developers want to say or try to achieve

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,960
or what their challenges are when I

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:50,650
design something and they go like why

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,390
did you think of this so that's one

00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,840
important thing for me why I wanted to

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,840
learn coding

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:11,370
I'm messing my slides up pretty bit but

00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:13,200
this should be the next slide I get

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,980
meaning meaningful conversations on

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,630
Twitter when I post my updates because

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,460
I'm not just posting like this is what I

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:24,029
did but I also tried to be involved

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,380
people ask questions so Rhian wietfeldt

00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:27,990
I think she spoke at this conference

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,270
last year she's one of my friends I

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:34,260
organized the local WordPress meetup

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:37,080
with her and on day 20 I learned about

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,960
opening and closing a pop-up with the

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,960
target selector and Ariane wietfeldt is

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,440
she's an accessibility expert and she

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,110
has a certain opinion on modal's and she

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,210
always says all modal's must die I think

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:55,140
that still relay the code of Congress to

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,970
say that so I mentioned her and she

00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,070
responded to that and someone else

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,840
responded to the heads but also with

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,610
other questions I had because I've been

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,799
learning some accessibility as well and

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,289
things I learned on the course is people

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,840
gave me new resources and they along

00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:12,270
side they learn me things as well so it

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,169
was good to have conversations about the

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,169
topics I was learning

00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:31,930
it really isn't this should be good let

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:36,020
me see I think we're at this light now

00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:39,620
it's called a hundred days of code so

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:44,420
maybe you ask yourself what happens on

00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:48,200
day 101 will I fall into a deep boredom

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,720
after that I'll get back to that in a

00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,830
minute

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:57,110
because maybe some of you have been

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,650
paying attention it's not that early

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,490
anymore

00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:04,130
yet your espresso so you're all awake I

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:09,800
started at January first and the current

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:11,300
day of the year is day 327 so you think

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:18,680
I should have been done by now

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:23,600
doing my hundred days I'm sorry this is

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:28,430
my last update and the last update is of

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:31,250
12 November and I was at day 19 so for

00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:34,400
me the hundred days of code one hour is

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,470
not a thing that if I miss a day I have

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,530
to start over again I do it up my own

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:43,790
pace so in the weekends I don't do it

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:46,010
when I travel it's a bit harder and also

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:50,540
the last few weeks I've been really

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:58,640
really slow in coding because I started

00:20:50,540 --> 00:21:00,440
learning JavaScript and it's because I

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,670
was doing this hundred days of code and

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,410
some of my friends from the WordPress

00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,090
community said like hey do you want to

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,950
be in a study group with us and we want

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,680
to learn react and there's this course

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,060
from the University of Helsinki and it

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,490
would be good if you joined us and we

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:18,350
can level each other up and I was just

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:20,090
like I'm the one with no knowledge and

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,430
you all know these things so why do you

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,140
want to do that they said well it's good

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,170
for more experienced people to learn

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,970
from people who know less because when

00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,590
you explain someone to someone this

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,270
experience do you learn from that as

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,050
well you get a better understanding of

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:37,050
the things you need

00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:42,060
so I'm like okay I'll join your

00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:45,480
JavaScript react group and after the

00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:49,290
first lesson I was totally clueless it's

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,770
like I'm not getting this I'm not

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:54,780
enjoying this but we had our

00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,520
accountability meetings and they

00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,160
convinced me like how we can help you

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,570
move forward and it will you don't have

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,880
to like it but you will get a better

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:06,690
understanding and I was good like okay

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,630
and then after two meetings I sort of

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:13,080
moves away from that reacts because I

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,840
don't know developers may know about

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,540
reacts but I've not heard anyone talk

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,740
about like oh I like this I understand

00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:27,330
this but I realized I missed a basic

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:29,370
understanding of JavaScript so I went

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,610
back to that free code camp and said I

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:34,650
need to do like es6 javascript basic

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,810
JavaScript first

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,150
so went back to that but every time I

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:43,950
open my laptop and did that like after

00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:49,710
half an hour I was like oh I don't like

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:54,570
JavaScript so maybe you should learn it

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,860
deeply but I don't want to so actually I

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,600
did this talk on Wednesday in the

00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,150
Netherlands and there's someone else

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,010
like why don't you quit with JavaScript

00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:06,390
do something you like remember rule

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:10,200
number five so I'm stopping I'm not

00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:12,570
learning JavaScript Hey so maybe the

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,440
last ten days will speed up again a bit

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:20,420
faster because I'm moving back to CSS

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,420
after etre returned from this conference

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:32,040
so ten days to go I'm gonna make it and

00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:33,390
but what happens after day 101 well what

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,120
you can do you can just continue

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,580
learning you can go to round 2 what I

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,240
see people do is do new updates so now I

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,690
post with day 1 100 days of code and

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,760
you'll probably see me continue with

00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,890
round 2 day 1 108

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:57,270
of coats but it won't be the alpha

00:23:49,890 --> 00:24:00,870
script I promise that what this talk

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,790
basically is about is not well it is

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,170
about learning coal because when you're

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,330
in the profession of web development

00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,670
when inputting you're a writer or

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,350
whether you're a designer or whether

00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,640
you're front-end and you won't need to

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,830
communicate with backends

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,610
I think it's so important if you learn

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:19,500
new things but it doesn't have to be

00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:22,290
code I think I think learning new things

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,680
helps you become better in whatever you

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,620
do

00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:29,640
so if coding is really not your thing

00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:32,910
you can think about SEO drawing design

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,300
writing gardening learning a new

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,770
language why not 100 days of walking I

00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,570
don't know if you heard about this Dutch

00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,450
guy who walked toward camp Europe this

00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:46,940
year he only did it for 30 days so it's

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:51,240
like you know you can do porto next year

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:53,760
so it can be anything you like and i

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:58,260
think that's basically my main message

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:02,160
like start learning if you're in web

00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:06,450
development design try to learn

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:09,060
something new that challenges you gives

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:12,600
you inspiration and you should be good

00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:15,810
and yeah i'm happy to help you out or

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,550
point you to resources if you have any

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,620
questions or if you want to share your

00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:23,040
updates with me like mention me on

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:28,770
twitter and say hey i've started i know

00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:31,160
give you thumbs up so thank you that was

00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,160
my talk

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:46,910
and these slides are up on my website

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:50,150
it's blue media dot u WC m IL 19 and if

00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:52,610
that's not working I also posted a tweet

00:25:50,150 --> 00:26:02,990
that will send you the right link

00:25:52,610 --> 00:26:04,880
if that'll works thank you before

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,480
opening the questions I have a question

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,900
for you

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,900
speaking of coding do you know there's

00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:15,290
this misconception of WordPress and

00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:18,260
coding so do we need to be coders I need

00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:24,770
to have Korean skills to contribute to

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:27,950
WordPress in European Lee ok stop is the

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:30,590
para un po di questa fronting Demento

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:34,400
maltose pays socially Nakia so separate

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:36,800
caliber Aria WordPress NHS sorry aware

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,460
del competency technique in photo de

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:44,600
programación so yeah that really is a

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:47,630
big misconception when I attended my

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,940
first work camp Europe in Vienna I was

00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,890
constantly making excuses when people

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,110
say what do you do it were piss and I

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:57,020
was like I'm not a developer like if

00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:59,300
that was the only thing and so you don't

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,380
need to be a developer to either make

00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,670
money with WordPress or be a contributor

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:10,280
and people have done that before will

00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:14,660
probably say that's true so no you don't

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,330
need it you you can do design or writing

00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,550
or beyond the polyglots which is very

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,130
important if you need to trip make local

00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:26,590
translations for instance for Italian so

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:30,320
no it's not necessary for that thank you

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:34,000
Jason and Amanda for the Deaf Arlen

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,000
italiana pull a rabbit um

00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:44,889
hi Monique

00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:47,750
I I missed I missed the beginning so

00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:50,570
what I don't know is what was your

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,549
starting point did you already were

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,169
you're already into web designing stuff

00:27:52,549 --> 00:28:04,730
like that or did you start your course

00:27:56,169 --> 00:28:08,500
from like zero I wanted to use this no

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:12,139
I've I've been a web designer

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:15,019
professionally since 2011 and before

00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:20,990
that I did it as a hobby from the 90s on

00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:23,600
so I already learned HTML like past

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:27,470
century so I had some basic

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:31,039
understanding but I think a lot of

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:33,259
people are self-taught in a web design

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,299
and web development and what you do when

00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:37,220
you need a certain bit of code you

00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,100
cherry-pick so you look up what you need

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:43,990
and you learned that bit so at some

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:47,059
point I also missed the overview of css3

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:51,049
so I knew some parts but the connecting

00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:54,230
dots like the CSS best specificity if I

00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:56,029
say it right so what comes first and at

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,070
what level and elements I learned stuff

00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:00,620
about that that I've been doing it

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,980
phrases but now it was like oh okay so

00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,250
it's I got a better overview connecting

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,259
dots

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,840
I said answer your question I asked the

00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:13,009
question because I've been trying to

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:17,409
work out for myself stuff on Drupal for

00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:17,409
10 years and I didn't go get anywhere

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm not good at programming but at least

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:27,889
you know it's now for two months that

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,409
I'm say with WordPress and it's like

00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:36,320
more motivating but doing this these

00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:39,470
hundred days one of my sensations

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:43,070
especially which you feel so alone when

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:45,260
you get stuck on stuff so I wonder if

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,320
doing it like you did

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:51,830
maybe like more fun because I haven't

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,650
had fun that's that's the thing if you

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:57,200
post it out people respond to you but

00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:00,590
also I think within the WordPress

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,870
community if you've met some people here

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,880
and you think they can help you or just

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,510
if you know them they will know people

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,300
who can help

00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,770
I'm already meeting people yeah so if

00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,620
you would do the hundred days of code

00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,460
like I said if I got had questions on

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,460
accessibility

00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,290
I would ping people who would know such

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,420
a thing and help me fertile I look into

00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,400
these resources so don't be afraid to

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,760
ask for help all right and you don't

00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,990
have to start January 1 right no you can

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,990
shirts you can start tomorrow

00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:41,090
other questions everyone starting

00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:46,940
tomorrow at did I inspires some people

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:49,340
to start doing this yeah it well looking

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,650
forward to seeing your progress and I'll

00:30:49,340 --> 00:31:04,130
be here all day so if you want to learn

00:30:51,650 --> 00:31:07,790
more like I'll be around coding and

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:17,180
working maybe speech will help like

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:19,130
speech coding I'm actually trying to do

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,170
two challenges now I'm doing a hundred

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:24,530
days of writing as well that's gonna be

00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,610
hard because you need your time to make

00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,920
money as well right

00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,510
it's the idea if you can combine it if

00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:38,650
you get paid for doing your hundred days

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:38,650
of code thank you so much grazie

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,440
