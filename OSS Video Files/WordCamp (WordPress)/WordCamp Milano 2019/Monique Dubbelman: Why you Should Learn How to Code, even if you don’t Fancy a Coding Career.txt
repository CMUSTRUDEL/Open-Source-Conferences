Publication date: 2020-02-14
Playlist: WordCamp Milano 2019
Description: 
	This year, Monique took the challenge of #100DaysOfCode. But why? Is she new to code? Does she need to learn code as a designer in the first place? And what does it behold? Is it a fixed format?
In this talk, she’ll explain what #100DaysOfCode is and why she took the challenge. She also challenges you to join, even though you don’t fancy a career as a frontend or backend developer.
