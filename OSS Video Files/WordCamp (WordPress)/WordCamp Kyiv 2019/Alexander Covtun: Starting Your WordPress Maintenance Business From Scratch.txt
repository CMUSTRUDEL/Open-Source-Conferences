	00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,660
about the expectation towards this

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,289
presentation so what I'm going to talk

00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,960
about because it's a pretty big

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,329
topic to start your WordPress Minh

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,559
Chinese business from the scratches I'm

00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:28,079
not going to talk about some legal stuff

00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:30,449
because it might be different the

00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,160
independence of the region for example

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,010
in my country it might be some stuff in

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,970
your country might be different one but

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,879
I'm going to tell you about my

00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:46,460
experience of starting this project

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:50,129
because unfortunately there were two

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,769
previous projects that failed and they

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:56,369
helped me to learn some important stuff

00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:58,790
about how to start your project and make

00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:58,790
it successful

00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:09,119
so click here so I start with the my

00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:11,850
name the steps that you will see now

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,770
aren't going according in the

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,320
coordinates to the development process

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,899
for example you might start with another

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,030
one just or I prepared my presentation

00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:23,700
with this one because it helped me to

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,070
follow the logical structure of my steps

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:32,760
for the presentation so did my name how

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:37,080
should the my name be so as the lady

00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:42,229
said mitem I did my name dot I have

00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:45,840
chosen for my website is WP dandy

00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:48,150
what does dandy mean so WP all of you

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
know it's WordPress yes what they mean

00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,340
is free for example so what we should

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,420
consider well choosing in my name first

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:01,979
of all is I think it's of course it's an

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:05,189
advice to choose come to my name does

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,890
come to my name surname and why to

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,229
prioritize account of my name

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,689
does come to my name instead of these us

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:18,239
in for because they're all wonderful but

00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:20,580
on lady is that nowadays users most of

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:26,819
the time associate any kind of Des

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:29,580
Moines name with calm for example I have

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,380
observed just looked into dashboard Mary

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,280
a wordpress website and I have observed

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,410
odd some of some of you already entered

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,180
website and he supposed mostly because

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,910
of these branding for some way of

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,740
looking at WP Dandy which Association

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,840
come into your mind first of all when

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,690
you're going to Google I mean are you

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,610
going to associate it with just W dandy

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:58,800
dotnet for example were most of the

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,800
times will be calm most of the users

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:07,160
nine it's already proved by some by some

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:11,040
researches that nine of out of ten users

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:15,060
they will search your Des Moines into

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,090
the come to my name one more thing

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,550
why we should choose dot combine and

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,959
instead of others to prioritize let's

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:28,770
say like this is because those Des

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,970
Moines are associated with palm so if

00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:37,560
you want your newsletters to reach your

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:41,900
audience most of the time calm will be

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,690
the choice because otherwise people will

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,720
spam your address of course we can

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,030
somebody might say to okay I'll do some

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,410
SPF so for example and so on Sephora and

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:58,050
I will secure my but one you know once

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,480
again it works so what else we should

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,190
use it so of course it's an advice is to

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,500
use for example if you're going to start

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,989
a business in WordPress is to use WP

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:12,769
because once again many people associate

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:17,970
WP with WordPress so if you will use

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:20,190
prefix like WP on in search engines most

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,290
of the time people will presumably

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,130
they'll have to choose between a couple

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,860
of domain names and the one will be you

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,169
are the my name in search search results

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,450
so it most probably the people will

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:37,229
click your the my name instead of waters

00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:40,530
it's a kind of of a trick that will help

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:43,560
you to get better results what else is

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,270
so another advice is to create an

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,570
appealing a member of the bomb into my

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:54,389
name for example when I was choosing my

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:58,100
the dominican using now it was pretty

00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:01,410
difficult so I ended up with even

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,600
because it had a idea how it should be

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,230
because we are providing Montana

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,290
services I headed up even it was such

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:14,280
situation that I thought for a couple of

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:17,270
reasons to name WP nanny like a

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,430
babysitter so it's kind of tricky but

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,760
fortunately and I ended up with WP dandy

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,560
and I supposedly the kind of good advice

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,900
for you to choose something that's a

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,280
member or for people and also it should

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,400
be appealing for example if you are

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,820
providing Lexi montañas services in this

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,889
situation it should show your user why

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:43,530
they should choose your service already

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:47,940
for the domani that you're using so this

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:51,180
is a regarding the domain name we're

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,850
going to the next it's hosting already I

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,610
suppose the most of you know a lot about

00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:01,440
hosting and which one would be a better

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:06,690
choice for your website so I thought the

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:09,510
same but I found some points that I

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,310
could cover here some advice would be to

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,550
choose a housing that is located in the

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,470
exact area with your clients I think

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,590
most of you will agree first of all

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:24,720
there is some pros in using hosting that

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:26,430
is close to your client clients I'm a

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,380
future clients for example we are

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:33,810
providing we are orienting mostly on US

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:37,770
clients so that we have chosen on the

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:40,710
domain in that area while it's a good

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,770
choice a good idea to choose at the

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,960
minor a hosting into the area first of

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,450
all the law this website with a lot

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,250
faster of course we could adjust our

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,220
website and do a lot of customization

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:57,150
only to work to make it work faster but

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,610
anyway your website will load faster to

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,580
users to your targeted users if you will

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:07,820
toss it into the region and of course

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,820
Google Google uses their searching

00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:17,180
algorithm them is the local businesses

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,650
so they see a good I mean Google sees

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:23,700
the location of your website and they

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,030
automatically think that it's suitable

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,890
for the United states-based for some

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,690
clients for some of course it's not the

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:34,850
only one that should be considering and

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:40,320
ranking but it is just one place for

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:44,070
your website another one is to offer a

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,360
highly reliable top-notch hosting of

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,810
course there are different kinds of

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:54,830
Hosting's and when we are starting our

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,830
project we mostly look because of some

00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:03,030
economic things for example like to save

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,680
some money we might choose what's a not

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,240
a very reliable hosting it is not a good

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,700
idea it's better to pay a little bit

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,740
more and to choose a reliable hosting

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,560
instead of one that you'll pay less and

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,080
as a result for somebody had a such a

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,530
situation when I started previous

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,150
project it was just a freeware hosting

00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,220
provider is like hosting your possibly

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,080
some of you know and I thought oh ok

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,750
it's a good choice for some I'm going to

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,970
toss my websites right here and it

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,060
started and was a kid would load very

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,210
key for me but when people started to go

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:41,070
to the website it would just shut down

00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:47,480
and so would not work ok the next

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:51,840
question is theme and it's controversial

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,320
because I wanted to name it design and

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,960
theme D is of course we can do do

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,710
whatever we want with our website for

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,020
example you have a lot of money you can

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,150
hire designer a developer that will put

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,790
all this together and create a custom

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,320
theme but once again it's with the

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,970
condition that you have

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,970
a good amount of money to get started

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,070
what I would advise here is to use a

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:29,370
multi-purpose theme instead of velvet

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:30,810
one and here are two two purposes why I

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,480
would advise you to do this

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,090
of course the thing that you devote

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,450
yourself as a developer might work but

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,340
it will need your time develop an Angus

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,890
and in the situation that you you are

00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,020
let's say one or two person dot doing a

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:50,040
lot of stuff and these kind of business

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,780
is pretty difficult because alongside

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,640
with your website you have to support

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,840
many other websites so you need more and

00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,420
more resources so in case you will

00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,970
choose already made multipurpose theme

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,120
for example you can adjust it by using

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:09,210
child theme for your website theme and

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,120
in the station all the updates will be

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,770
practically for free for you and they

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,780
will be secured and that's not for sure

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,400
you don't you won't have to to to spend

00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,820
your time developing and maintaining

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,530
your own theme another advice here will

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,840
be to choose and optimize both theme

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:31,830
because I'm going to talk and the next

00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:35,000
slide what does it mean exactly as I

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,160
said if you decide to choose premade

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,150
multi-purpose them you have to look into

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:46,460
the theme and to see if it works really

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,460
it is optimizable of course

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:53,640
so speed speed of your website it's also

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:57,660
very important because we know that

00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:01,800
there a couple of points in Google's

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,810
search algorithm that are very sensible

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,040
for the speed of a website somebody

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:10,520
mentioned today about a and P of the

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,040
website I don't think it's an option for

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,980
business until now because it is a very

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,430
very cut version of what your website

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:23,030
can provide and but a good optimization

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,950
is a mass for every business dot store

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:30,910
on the website Amazon for example has

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:34,460
some statistics that tell us that around

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,940
20% of the clients will leave your

00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,310
website with each passing second dot

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,560
will your website will load for example

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,320
let's say you have 100 percent you load

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,050
for example 2 minutes 2 seconds and so

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,990
if somebody will wait for 3 seconds they

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:54,620
will leave and so on so forth so after 6

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:59,590
seconds you have almost no clients on

00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:04,810
your website I'm sorry forgot how we can

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:07,460
choose which team to use of course I

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,870
mentioned when I send it presentation

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,120
that is mostly for those who want to

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,100
start your business but now I see a lot

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,200
of developers so some of you might not

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,120
agree with me because you can you know

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,460
your job you can do even better but this

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,040
is for those who don't want to spend a

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,450
lot of time in turning their theme and

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,450
doing stuff like these but instead they

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:30,800
want to spend their time for something

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:32,750
else so what how we can see if our theme

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,730
is optimizable for example we can run it

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,000
through the speed checker for example

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:40,490
like PageSpeed insights from that is

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,910
using lighthouse and if it doesn't help

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:47,660
for example because sometimes it doesn't

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:49,430
see those Broncs and that from stuff

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:56,000
that happens with your website so GT

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:59,690
metrics might help you so even those

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,130
well may theme need some optimization

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:05,720
because when you enter all I say a demo

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,220
theme for example and you're looking

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,830
into the same it looks pretty good so

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,710
you're going for the through this

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:16,430
checker and your series around 90

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,860
percent in google pace before someone

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,690
say ok that sees my team but you can get

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,550
even better for example if you optimize

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:27,020
your theme so yeah there are some

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,180
different type of practices in this

00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,700
situation so you can optimize the entire

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,830
code or you could use some plugins that

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,640
are free of charge on in ultra

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:42,650
suppository for some I personally

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:45,460
I use I'm using just a single plug-in

00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:51,770
for this purposes is Auto optimized and

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:54,860
some caught into HTP access files so it

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:59,630
helps me to get some good results around

00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:03,470
90% for the digital version in Google

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:06,620
PageSpeed of course database

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:09,200
optimization the very beginning it will

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:13,550
work for you but with time as your

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:16,730
company voice your website a few more

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:19,130
means okay thank you very much okay so

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,930
and the last version of the PHP it also

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:26,260
very helpful why I'm talking about it is

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:31,000
because yeah you want your website to

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,000
get high into the searchers in

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:38,360
engineering and the security of course

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:42,290
security also matters very much so

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,320
so you have let's make an assumption

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:48,770
that you have started your web website

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,190
or business websites so and you might

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:54,320
observe that some people might try

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,670
penetrate your website so of course

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,950
there are a lot of practices how to

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:02,330
secure website and here just some of

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:06,590
them because there is no 100% proof and

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:11,200
games talking nowadays I also okay let's

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:16,310
go from top to down so using HTTP see

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:20,660
HTTP encrypted connection is helpful it

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,730
it is even more effective when you

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,980
receive payments on your website for

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,160
example I observed that some businesses

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,990
in my field like montañas for example

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,990
some of you might know this website like

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:39,560
WP curve for example there are some more

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,780
so that they are not using the users

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,850
using just a couple of forms that they

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,580
get the information from the clients and

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,110
they don't use payment but in case you

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,030
will be using payment right on your

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,720
website for something is a good plugin

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:54,199
that might for

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,470
registration is called Project Tapia

00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,329
that it helps you to get the project

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,120
tasks to communicate with your clients

00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:04,100
right on your website and even payment

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,529
might go through your website so in this

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,829
situation encrypted connection will be

00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:14,029
very helpful so to keep your WordPress

00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:17,540
core plugins team up to date it's an

00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:22,370
obvious point but yeah we have to keep

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:28,220
it secured auntie Peters plug in some

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:31,069
personal I use I don't remember Zack we

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,370
have some emotions but it's a good use

00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:37,490
an anti-virus even though it's not very

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:42,139
practical so you'll have to do most of

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:45,319
the checking by yourself but on yeah it

00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:49,220
might be helpful to hide your

00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:51,649
identification all pages mostly once

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,339
again for the security reasons because I

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:57,379
VI is if this is a homemade hacker so

00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:01,209
they might interview over saying look

00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:05,750
just for and also there's a problem with

00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:08,990
google dorks for example I have learned

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:12,110
about this topic for some time ago and

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,689
observed that even my website would be a

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:18,020
potential victim of the hackers just

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:21,439
introducing in Google just these two

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:24,530
commas and wp-admin and they would find

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,600
at this WordPress website I used two

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,429
factor authentication mostly for the

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:34,520
admin panel had any possible information

00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:36,620
regarding the CMS actually I think it's

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,530
pretty easy to do in this situation so

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:42,169
you won't need to spend all the time by

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,700
using a child theme that will have no

00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:45,440
information about the website of course

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,659
you can dig deeper and find information

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,210
but once again it might be helpful for

00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:52,549
at least for the first time and RAM

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:56,480
penetration testing possibly some of you

00:17:52,549 --> 00:18:03,380
are using this kind of like software

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:04,519
like WP scan on Kali Linux for example

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,759
each time I update

00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,919
my website I am looking running I'm

00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:13,479
running it through the WP scan well to

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:18,320
see it if it doesn't have some

00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:20,989
vulnerabilities as you were okay

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,789
I'm not very good in SEO but there is

00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:25,999
some because once again I have started

00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:28,820
in on my own and I can't afford now

00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:31,219
paying for a good as you all experts so

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,269
I have to do I had to study a lot of

00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:38,149
stuff on my own and so for already half

00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:41,899
a year I am studying very hard this

00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:47,329
topic and what I can advise you here is

00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:49,519
a good American as you all expressed

00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:53,209
like nail Patel I don't know if you ever

00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,829
heard about him he doesn't tell one high

00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:58,940
person would have to do but it's pretty

00:18:54,829 --> 00:19:04,369
pretty good a pleased to know all that

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:06,919
stuff so in terms of SEO we know those

00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:10,129
who are good in as two all will agree

00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:12,349
with me we have two stages in like

00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:15,649
working with that so it's on page still

00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:19,309
and off page so and some advices once

00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:21,440
again this is not at not a to-do list

00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:23,599
just a couple of advices from what I

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,489
observed first of all four on page so

00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,519
what we have to do we have to run and

00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:32,809
implement and initial one on page so I

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:34,700
did can we do it on our own I think just

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:40,009
searching for some information on Google

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,779
we can do it on ourselves another advice

00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:44,239
would be to before and DEF keyword

00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,979
competitive research of course somebody

00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:47,899
some of you might say for example okay

00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:52,789
you need a lot of time a lot of money

00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:56,749
for example to pay some tools like I

00:19:52,789 --> 00:20:01,009
don't know a is your F for example were

00:19:56,749 --> 00:20:04,099
Sam brush once again for a very tight

00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:10,070
budget you might use nail Patel's as the

00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:12,739
oh mmm tool that is called uber suggests

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,499
it's uploaded for free and even though

00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:18,200
it doesn't give you 100% accurate

00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:23,090
results but it at least help you

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:26,359
in a couple of things to work with uh of

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,429
course he didn't find and contract an

00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,899
expert um I'm sorry

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:35,029
but you get a waste of probably work

00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:37,190
keywords so my mistake in my previous

00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:39,200
project was that I have put myself the

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,940
pre-work keywords I have done some

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,320
articles and I would expect to get

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,840
resolved but it doesn't matter this way

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,669
so my advice would be to choose those

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,460
keywords that you want to rank for and

00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:51,799
after that you can unleash the

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:56,149
creativity of your copywriter

00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:58,190
so don't I don't know let's see ask them

00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:00,980
to do just use these keywords and that's

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,470
all for example just try to limit the

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,590
area for example if this word press to

00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:08,570
be word press and it did find contract

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,190
and expert native speaker as super

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:15,970
writer some devices would be here when

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,399
you are contracting this kind of

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:23,419
personal is to choose a copywriter that

00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:27,529
says the language of the region that you

00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:30,889
are targeting for example I have worked

00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:32,840
with some British copywriters with some

00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,419
even with some Indians because I would

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,129
think at the very beginning the lower

00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,049
price is better but after that I

00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,419
understand it doesn't work this way so

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,789
you have to pay a police an average

00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:46,190
price in order to get some results that

00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:48,799
might be useful for you because paying

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:51,200
less it doesn't mean that you get

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,289
because if it would be this way everyone

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,450
would be I don't know expert so

00:21:54,289 --> 00:22:02,149
copywriter so that from my experience I

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,940
found an average price and I am using I

00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:06,289
am contracting now only American

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,399
copyrighted because once again I'm all

00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:13,730
renting on American market and I can say

00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:15,679
that it works I have observed that those

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,869
artistic articles that were written by

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,480
British cut providers those the same

00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:24,320
language is English but most of the

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,899
people future clients that would come to

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,129
my website would be British once and

00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:32,060
some Indians so as I'm not going good to

00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:34,190
you covered

00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,820
markets so I decided to switch to

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:42,050
America practice so now I used just this

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:44,690
once and have your hazard content

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,120
published of course this is all ready

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:51,200
for the next one but okay so some of

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,910
page SEO is to identify a website that

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,590
are closely related to your niche in

00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,260
order to do some link building of course

00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:00,320
it's a very huge topic to discuss about

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:03,590
but what I would suggest you to use the

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,540
same language the website that have the

00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,290
same language like American English for

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,780
your website because once again you will

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:14,000
narrow the targeted audience of your

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,360
website and Google somehow also sees

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,970
these things so it gives give you some

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:25,220
more G's contract their own guests by

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:28,430
the way there is a way how we can build

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:31,400
a good link being strategies by using

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,920
guest passing I think all most of you

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,870
know Bo this so I'm not going to talk

00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,870
very much about this but once again try

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:41,570
to choose only the best quality websites

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,250
for example some website they have some

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,040
trash articles you know don't need even

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:52,580
though they will give you a link but you

00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:54,410
don't need this kind of get a guess what

00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,480
published have your back laying and

00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,070
repeat it once again so time bed time

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,820
don't work it 110

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:04,760
well articles try to do the best of your

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,130
own to get the best results that's

00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,060
article the best link so the next one is

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,600
the poor channels

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,910
once again on when we are providing

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,390
support channels I observed that some of

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:22,700
the competitors in this same field

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:24,410
they have some poor poor channels

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,300
communication channels for example some

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,100
don't provide like messenger for example

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,850
some don't provide the contact form and

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,210
so on so forth first of all for the

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:37,250
point of view of trust Americans were

00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,960
like say what they're European countries

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,200
they won't trust you until you don't

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,120
have at least a phone number in the

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,920
country for example as I mentioned I'm

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,279
Orion you're an American marking so I

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,649
have

00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:54,440
phone number how to do this I personally

00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:57,379
use and seep I don't know if I pronounce

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,450
it correctly sleep softening until I

00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:01,879
won't find some guys that who I will be

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,969
able to deal with them because we are

00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:06,649
working with a company that but we need

00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:08,779
to find an agreement for example which

00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:10,669
project they take for themselves which

00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:15,259
projects are we going to give to them in

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:17,119
order to do this kind of business so and

00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:19,070
to another advice would be to use a

00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,899
project management panel so ultimate

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,999
ization is very important if you're

00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:28,509
going to use as a normal contact form

00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:30,589
it's just zero to optimization so

00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:32,179
contact man I'm sorry

00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:34,519
project management panel would be very

00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:37,039
useful for you in order to optimize of

00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:39,710
course you can also use a CRM for

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,899
example to do some more optimization and

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:46,299
as I mentioned previously to use a u.s.

00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:53,809
phone number it's also increases the

00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:58,549
level of trust ability to your website

00:25:53,809 --> 00:26:00,950
and that's all because I don't have more

00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:03,289
time so in case you have some questions

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,349
so be glad to answer your question once

00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:08,629
again is just what I observe it and it

00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:12,109
helped me to get those results so it

00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:14,869
might be a lot of even more points that

00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:16,279
might be useful in the station but at

00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:22,839
this point this is what I would like to

00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:22,839
share with you thank you very much

00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,819
[Applause]

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:37,710
thank you for first of all thank you for

00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:42,090
your speech I have a small equation the

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:45,630
world Google have known you'd an area

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:49,490
like dot depth and what do you think

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:56,160
about use this for development of

00:26:49,490 --> 00:27:00,980
wordpress for block or another this do

00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:03,390
you know yes dot def like instead calm

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:08,790
no one ever heard about this possible is

00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:11,220
my my mistake now we heard about this

00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,950
but the idea if I would choose another

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,120
type of domain name for this actually I

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:20,010
thought that I might use also AO because

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,070
I thought my project would be something

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,570
very innovative but I pretty quickly

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,580
understood that there are a lot of

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:29,220
companies that do the same stuff so all

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:32,760
I have to do is to keep real for some

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:35,070
let's say like this and to do the job

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,890
that most of the people do but to do the

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,380
better for example I don't know for some

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,150
of you enter some of the computers

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,190
website there are a lot or some just

00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,020
introducing Google WordPress montañas

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:49,650
and you will see a lot of computers that

00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,660
do the same stuff but they their website

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,720
are loading very slow I suppose it's a

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,810
kind of their mistake so not making them

00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,360
lot faster but about what you answered

00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,070
what your question was I wouldn't choose

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,830
another de mine instead of just calm

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,530
once again there is some reasons why we

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:09,420
have to stick with Comte de my name and

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,950
of course if your project is very

00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,260
innovative and in providing something

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:16,140
that only your project can do its

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:19,170
io4 example it's also very trusted a

00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,110
divine name but mostly when I entered a

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,910
website I choose to come the dot-com

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,680
domain and after that they moved to IO

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,870
if I think that it might be something

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,160
innovative thank you very much for you

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,160
very much for your question

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:40,409
