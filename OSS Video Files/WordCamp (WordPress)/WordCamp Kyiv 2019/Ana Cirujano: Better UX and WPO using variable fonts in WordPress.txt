Title: Ana Cirujano: Better UX and WPO using variable fonts in WordPress
Publication date: 2020-02-12
Playlist: WordCamp Kyiv 2019
Description: 
	Using variable fonts in WordPress we can get the texts of a website to adapt to the context of the user, in order to get more readable and attractive texts, achieving great performance, without sacrificing the loading speed.
Variable fonts can change their properties -such as width or weight, for example- using just one file!
We will see how you can use it in WordPress (CSS code) and all the advantages they have comparing to standard fonts. We will also go over real examples of how to create and apply variable fonts.

thank you all for for being here and

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,650
thanks to the organization for trust me

00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:25,239
trusting me and well let's talk about

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:29,559
phone about design well I am Nishita

00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:34,600
Hannah and I killed Regina for you and I

00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:37,270
am from Spain and I am a business owner

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,379
and Spain I am a freelancer and designer

00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:44,410
and I am in love with typography and

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:53,590
with WordPress it says you can see my

00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:56,470
contribution to WordPress so one of the

00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:00,180
most important aspects of communicating

00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:04,360
win with type is to establish a strong

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,740
typographic hierarchy visual hierarchy

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:13,539
tells people people were to look and

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:17,399
what things are most important look at

00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:21,850
the typography of these well-designed

00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:25,209
magazine covers there are many different

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:29,409
typefaces different weights lighter and

00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:35,109
bolder different stretchers content said

00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:37,719
or expanded ok these variations are used

00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:41,829
to create visual tension and hierarchy

00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:44,139
control the pace and guide your i-phone

00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:47,099
work variations can also be used in

00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:52,209
order to add emphasis for smaller sizes

00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:55,719
without reducing a legibility these are

00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:58,590
some samples of printed design but what

00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:01,719
happens with web design could we design

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:07,539
something something like this for a

00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:10,959
website when you said our variation in a

00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:14,590
font the so where uses a specific font

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:18,130
file foot for that variation a standard

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:22,050
type family you can have up to 20 or

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,050
even more font files

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:32,620
a website using too many fonts can have

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:35,080
a great impact on performance in 2016

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,560
some of the biggest tech companies

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,470
around the world signed off on a new

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:47,080
standard that is part of an update to

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:50,200
open type variable fonts variable font

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,040
is a single fund that acts as many

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,870
phones and these results in incredible

00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:01,720
performance benefits here is a website

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,500
performance test of the liberal Franklin

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,410
Holt I faced family compared to a

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:14,650
website using liver Franklin variable

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:18,070
font the variable font results in fewer

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,070
HTML request a smaller file size so

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:28,330
large larger savings of downloaded data

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:30,489
and faster loading speed it's variable

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,180
phone has different font variations

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:37,989
defined by the font designer in the font

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,340
file there are five reserved or

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:49,200
registered axis weight with Optical size

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:49,200
italic and slant let's see they wait

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,209
here you can see the difference between

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,489
a fall bald and a real bold a football

00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,860
is created by the browser if the font

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:03,700
file is missing and a real ball is

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,720
decided by the phone designer using real

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:15,430
weights is very important for a better

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:18,310
legibility also return beauty these are

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:23,260
the weights you can set using standard

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:26,590
font using variable fonts you don't just

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,110
have those individual master weights you

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:35,169
have access to all of the values in

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,980
between you can set 102 or 547 because

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,520
they access

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:42,310
we interpolated so using CSS we can

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:47,170
animate these values to get a smooth

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,580
transition so I'm going to activate the

00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:56,620
video okay

00:04:48,580 --> 00:05:02,100
I know Tillich Russian okay

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,100
maybe this one just leaked

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:31,150
okay you can see the the axis wait a

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:39,690
very okay changing changing the end away

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:39,690
from 1350 to 1007 ball

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:50,669
the activate yeah here okay okay so

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,949
let's see there with the axis widow

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:56,800
this is the wit axis just like wait

00:05:53,949 --> 00:06:00,150
you can set an animate our range of

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,150
values of width

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:14,080
okay you can look and see it switching

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:27,190
from 60 60 and a 100 or with condensing

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:29,830
and sponding span it a variable phone

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,949
can contain many different axes that can

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,130
do different things at the same time in

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:38,469
telegraphy you can you can see the

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:42,759
letters the carters changing the width

00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:48,779
exceed axis and the weight axis at the

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,779
same time so let's see optical size

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,710
optical size is an axis to improve the

00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:58,690
eligibility in smaller sizes on the

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,330
right you can see the glyphs for bigger

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:05,830
sizes with more color contrast and

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:12,630
detail on the LED for for smaller sizes

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:20,139
with less contrast and it'll this is a

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:23,349
sample more contrast and detail and less

00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,620
contrast of meeting with just a one font

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,620
file

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:42,649
let's see the italic and slant axis you

00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,769
can set more or less slanted text and

00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:48,469
you can set italics you can tell the

00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:52,759
difference between Islam and slanted

00:07:48,469 --> 00:08:01,569
text and italic you can see for example

00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:04,909
a a that is so different or the P

00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:08,959
character that is so different so it's

00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:13,729
not the same slanted test or italics I

00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:18,610
really thought it so how can we use

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:18,610
variable phones in our WordPress website

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:27,759
browser support is really good actually

00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:31,339
with this level of support we can using

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:37,490
variable for phones now or at least

00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:41,089
experiment with them the way we use

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,360
variable fonts in our CSS is pretty much

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:47,300
the same as the way we use phones now in

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,240
our WordPress website we set up the

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,910
phone using font face and we need to

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,879
provide a fallback for older browsers

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,759
the main change is that we need to

00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:03,920
define our range of values for example

00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:07,639
we can define 200 to 600 for the font

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:13,120
weight out of this range we can't

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:14,809
declare any value once you've done that

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,180
do declare

00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:27,009
the values for the properties as you

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:32,300
usually do in CSS you can also use now

00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:35,839
google fonts Auto is in beta version but

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:39,529
this is the way you need to declare the

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,010
to import the font family and declare

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:44,900
the range of values you can use

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:48,410
in the presentation we are going to

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,350
share with you and you can find a link

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:59,540
to more information about how how you

00:09:51,350 --> 00:10:02,900
have to declare your CSS and as you know

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:06,890
in the new theme standard film that is a

00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:15,820
include in the new WordPress version 5.3

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:19,370
that is about to be M is including

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:22,040
variable funds so you can as you know

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:25,820
it's open source it's WordPress so you

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:29,480
can check how it's doing how is

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:34,430
declaring how is using this interval a

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:41,330
variable form and see how is the code

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:43,760
made okay all right okay this is a these

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,740
are all the values you can declare for

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,170
the con for controlling any of the

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:53,510
standard axis the five standard or

00:10:48,170 --> 00:11:02,360
registered axis let's see they cast on

00:10:53,510 --> 00:11:04,610
axis I have another video here and the

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,350
type designer can create custom axis

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,470
that provides a developer with the power

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,600
to control every aspect of a font for a

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,550
sampler this is our for example this is

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,160
a custom axis for controlling the serif

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,950
you can create a phone with more or less

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,600
said if I don't know if you can tell but

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:27,640
it's a phone switching from Salif and

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,640
non-serif with just one file

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:45,660
this is another video we could also

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,760
change the hair height or depth of of

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,390
ascenders or the sender's you can see in

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,390
this video

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,210
Costin axis can be created for

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:13,570
controlling every little detail of the

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:16,810
glyphs shape since we can create any

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:31,780
safe in a font file the phone designer

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:42,760
can also create something like this I'm

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:48,010
sorry or this this is just 1 glyph CSS

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:57,160
and a keyframe animation let's see how

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:58,720
we can make it okay in this example we

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,480
can see a variable phone with the

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,260
vectorial drawing of a horse with an

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,660
axis called

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,720
time and a keyframe animation in CSS

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:12,370
this is all they call the code we need

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:24,070
to make this animation but how is they

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:26,440
found file mate okay this is the

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,290
variable font file we have just one leaf

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:34,390
with 16 keyframes as intermediate

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:37,570
masters that's it the cover is a

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,880
variable phone that has 15 custom axis

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:43,800
the versatility of the cover is a good

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:47,650
sample of the power of variable phones

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,770
when using our variable font with

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,880
capstan axis it's important to specify

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,820
every single axis

00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:01,420
the variation settings even if the value

00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:08,200
is zero let's go over some real examples

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:11,620
of bar even phones as we have shown the

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:14,290
problem with performance and we are not

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,570
limited by a technical issues we don't

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,200
have to worry about how many phone

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:22,080
baryons have load in in the website in

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,100
this example we can choose a typeface

00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,310
differ a different typeface for

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:34,630
headlines of good news and we can choose

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:38,610
a different one for bad news we can make

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,610
the character change on hover

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,770
using variable phones allows us to make

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,950
things more readable or smaller or

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:02,760
larger screens like an upper world a

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:04,110
projector a laptop or a phone we can

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,420
only fight a part of it to be more

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:09,870
readable and more legible depending on

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,510
the environment in this example when the

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,940
screen when the screen is smaller the

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,390
characters are narrow well we don't need

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,690
to sacrifice design for performance

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:24,960
creativity can start to determinate our

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:33,480
ptosis is still in stead of technical

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:36,600
limitations through interpolation we can

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,670
shift forward or backward smoothly to

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:54,089
highlight pertinent information for a

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:58,310
particular distant range we can create

00:15:54,089 --> 00:16:05,220
sufficient contrast based on the user's

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:08,339
environment maybe you can't see it but

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:20,220
when it's not light the the Carta

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:23,880
changes to be more readable here you do

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:27,320
have some resources for funding and

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:32,100
testing variable phones

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:38,160
access proxies is for for funding and on

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:42,690
testing also free phones or play type

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:48,209
details for you can write your custom

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:51,000
text as you can see this is another

00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,850
another resource for for testing funding

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,360
okay and this is a very interesting

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,570
website because you can just drop a font

00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,570
and

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:07,020
get the information about that phone

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:10,680
what axes are designed for by the phone

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:17,030
designer and how you can declare the CSS

00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:17,030
and also export the CSS to use that font

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:26,040
I would like to recommend you some

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:30,090
people are experts in variable phones

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:33,230
that is on par Melton Pimentel he has a

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,960
very good newsletter with the with the

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,480
latest news about variable phones and I

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,460
recommend you to follow him

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:49,820
and also Mandy Michael she has a lot of

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:57,360
good and samples also some samples with

00:17:49,820 --> 00:18:00,540
variable phones CSS and JavaScript yeah

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:05,910
to sum up some benefits of their

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:07,920
benefits or using variable phones using

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,440
variable phones health apps improve the

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,630
performance of our WordPress websites we

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,860
can create better experience for our

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,020
users by making content more accessible

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,410
even more we can create a better way to

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,480
communicate I hope you enjoyed this

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:34,880
presentation and I encourage you to

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:34,880
start using wearable phones spasiba

00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,470
thank you for the presentation you

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:54,290
showed a very interesting example of the

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:56,760
animated glyphs and I'm wonder how its

00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:59,850
how its achieved in terms of the

00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:04,880
technical side I mean is it really a

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:08,670
single shape for each value of the axis

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:13,620
yes you can see the phone fight you need

00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:16,710
a specific sort in order to design

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,090
the phoned yes it's not actually

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,049
changing the shape

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:24,659
yeah it's having a different shape

00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:29,850
vector shape for each of these frames

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:31,710
right I mean it means it would mean that

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,860
it will increase the size of the font if

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:37,500
you yeah is animation in CSS with

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:42,059
keyframes it's normal CSS animation is a

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,520
standard I mean when you design this

00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:48,080
font to create those variations on the

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:53,120
axis do you need to design a different

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:56,399
shape vector shape for each of the yeah

00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:01,260
you have 300 characters in just one

00:19:56,399 --> 00:20:04,950
phone file to draw every save you can

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:09,270
imagine or even in colors because we

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:12,600
have color phones support support and

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:15,809
and we can draw everything everything in

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:19,890
we can imagine yeah using just one phone

00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:23,600
file 300 characters yes but even more

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:26,610
this font file actually contains like

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,260
100 different shapes for a single letter

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:33,289
it means it will increase in the size

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,289
the forest yeah of course yeah thank you

00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:42,899
what do you think what is the best way

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,559
for example for the font size units on

00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:48,720
the responsive can we for example create

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:56,549
font size depends on the user screen

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:59,549
like with with the min and Max limits um

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:06,289
I don't know if I get your question but

00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:12,179
a I best units yeah a good question I

00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:16,820
could be always a flexible so you have

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:23,399
to do you should use em or ram-air

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:26,640
LEM because it's always the depending on

00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:34,360
the width

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:39,130
device you never set in pixels the

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:46,720
browser's rendered in pixels was always

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:51,880
declare in e/m or r.e.m and there are

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:56,110
that units in relative to the viewport

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,850
but these units are not accessible we

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:02,410
cannot use remote yam because it's

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:06,010
depends on the root HTML and yam depends

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:09,070
on the RAM I don't remember the parent

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:11,200
the per area font size so if we don't

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:15,420
change on responsive the root font size

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,350
we it doesn't affect any with the rim so

00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,580
what do you think maybe you have

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:26,590
experience to use depends on the font on

00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:29,350
the window screen size like with you

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:36,270
have change the before pupil units yeah

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:41,320
with em you have to be more monied to

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:45,040
plan do apply good planification yeah

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:49,510
yeah so you can use REM but a beautiful

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:53,710
unit is not accessible because when we

00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:59,070
are when we design or code responsive

00:22:53,710 --> 00:23:02,770
websites we are always have to be very

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:11,050
caring about we have to care about the

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:17,160
user in in the last the user can change

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:22,020
the font size in in the in his or her

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:24,790
browser so if you set the font size

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,830
depending on the width of the pupil

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:34,810
you are not respecting respecting the

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:39,309
user set so it's not-it's not accessible

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:41,769
and you can think about because media

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:45,129
Media queries are not working here

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:48,490
because I think about a TV or a

00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:55,929
projector you are setting maybe a media

00:23:48,490 --> 00:24:00,179
query with 1900 pixels or error am but a

00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:04,749
it's not the maximum size or the screen

00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:09,509
you know the maximum skin so it's so

00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:15,100
much better to to declare in and that

00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:17,379
e/m or yeah thank you for the speech

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,119
this is the first time I hear about the

00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:22,269
variable one suppose I'm a began

00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:25,710
developer but anyway I have a question

00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:28,899
how big is that file with the horse

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:31,090
excuse me how what is the what is the

00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:35,470
file size of that file with the horse

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:39,600
animation it's possible I don't remember

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:44,619
that's funny but this is not not much

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:55,119
I'll I'll tweet this for you thank you

00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:59,200
very much thank you in Guiana I have one

00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:02,740
small question as a regular user of a

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,619
website I'm using some google fonts I'm

00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,289
happy users are not so happy because

00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:13,539
they need to wait while all those google

00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:16,779
fonts are loading so does Google font

00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:22,720
already supports this variable font and

00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:27,279
if yes what benefits I will get if I

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,809
just enable or use variable font without

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:35,980
any other styling or animation as you

00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:42,720
showed us you can use a google fonts but

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:47,379
there are some just a ten or twelve

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,740
today a fonts now google fonts and it's

00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,030
not many phones now Anna and there are

00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,790
in

00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:58,800
the person but you can start

00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:03,540
experimenting with them and the benefits

00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,540
or using what what is your question

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:14,920
so I'm asking if I will switch to

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:17,500
variable font right I will take the same

00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:21,190
one and just use the variable font

00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:26,230
version what benefits it gives the

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:30,430
benefit is performance the main benefit

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:36,520
is you can you can respect the shape of

00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:40,900
the character as I for example the real

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:46,090
italic if you don't have the file in

00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:49,090
your server or or making a request to

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:52,600
Google font to that specific variation

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:55,180
for the italic you are making a for

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:59,220
italics not really italic so you are

00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:03,220
getting slant just slant but you need

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:07,780
real italics for a better user

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:11,650
experience and also the this optical

00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:14,980
size you you can get the real shape of

00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:19,860
the letter and change changing depending

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:25,300
on the screen and this is automatic and

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:29,110
also the this one you can you can use a

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:32,200
real bolt it's not just boarded in the

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:36,090
letter so it's the little bolder design

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:40,780
by the phone designer so it's the safest

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:43,030
better for legibility and for forgetting

00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:47,380
the the beauty of the of the letter with

00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:54,880
the contrast yeah it's for better use

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:59,050
experience and if you if you get this

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:03,790
one in now you need a minimum three font

00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:06,279
files but now you can use just one for

00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:10,970
files with open type with more

00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:22,250
tables and and you have all these

00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:32,870
benefits for the thank you are you using

00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:35,409
a phone display CSS feature for this

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:41,919
place yeah

00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:47,090
what is the question yeah this is for

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:52,730
when the browser is not yet is not

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:58,880
downloaded they found you can switch to

00:28:52,730 --> 00:29:04,639
swap in order to not so in the backup

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:07,880
font a fallback font so it depends on is

00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:11,210
for you it's important the exactly

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:17,710
typeface or for just not so important a

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:21,679
maybe you can use a serif or sans serif

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:24,919
the browser is loading the phone quickly

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:29,830
because it's the you shall have the

00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:33,159
phone in the in his pro or her browser

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:37,809
so if you Eve for you it's important

00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:42,260
because you know that they default

00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:46,700
change their size depending on the what

00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:49,549
type face is you you can change this

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:54,130
value the dependent is the most

00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:56,950
important for you or not to use swap

00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:03,830
depending if for is important because

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:06,769
the typeface is changing your design

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,570
because because they the typhus is

00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:13,490
changing the

00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:17,690
the size of the fault or not or for you

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:20,440
is not important but the user if they if

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:24,370
they've you said get the text before I

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:28,250
thought they don't get your typeface
