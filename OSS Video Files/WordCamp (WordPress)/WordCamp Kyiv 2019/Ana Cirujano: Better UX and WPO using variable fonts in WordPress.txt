Playlist: WordCamp Kyiv 2019
Description: 
	Using variable fonts in WordPress we can get the texts of a website to adapt to the context of the user, in order to get more readable and attractive texts, achieving great performance, without sacrificing the loading speed.
Variable fonts can change their properties -such as width or weight, for example- using just one file!
We will see how you can use it in WordPress (CSS code) and all the advantages they have comparing to standard fonts. We will also go over real examples of how to create and apply variable fonts.
