Title: Bill Gilmore: Building Better Themes
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	In my talk I will cover a wide range of interesting WordPress API features. We will start with the basics like pulling dynamic content from pages and posts, moving onto using featured images and custom fields to a build a reusable banner as a chunk of php to call into our theme templates.
If any of that sounded worrying please remember I am not a PHP developer, WordPress just makes life easy for all of us if you know to to use it. We will also cover topics to give your end user move control like custom shortcodes, widgets areas, menus and author bios.
We will then dig into creating custom post types and advanced custom fields, all made easy with Toolset Types plugin. Then we will focus on how to pull post types into templates using wp-query.
Finally we will look at WordPress customise features giving your end user control over all the content we have built so far as well as the colours, logo image and style of the site. This will wrap up into a dynamic theme with a user friendly interface… and there might even be some free DLC resources I have been working on.
Please remember I’m going to keep this talk in a language and terminology that everyone can understand, I am not a backend PHP robot, I’m an experienced developer and trainer. Hope you see you there WP Devs!

some certain little WordPress community

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,500
go on I don't want to dwell all this too

00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,540
long but I just wanted to let you know

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,860
we could I am not too big myself up but

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,829
more to give you context to why I'm

00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,779
telling you stuff okay so essentially I

00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,099
am the front-end developer I work in

00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:29,860
flinch studios it's a really exciting

00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:31,689
development folks that we work in we're

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,370
currently recruiting and responding so

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,630
if any our front-end developers back-end

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,790
developers and you're looking for a new

00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,580
challenge let me know because we really

00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,860
interested hear from you my five years

00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:45,760
experience building WordPress things I

00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,380
use HTML CSS JavaScript a little bit of

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,050
PHP which we're gonna look out today but

00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm not a developer a lot of WordPress

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,480
API logic is why I call them

00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,390
so I'm also the multi HJs application

00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,340
developer I recently developed to do

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,250
this which I release book release on the

00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,229
App Store doubled with a couple of wee

00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,140
things of search engine jQuery par that

00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:13,780
IV and stuff so I'm also a he's

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,060
WordPress Tom weight least WordPress are

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,250
self boosted blog back in 1999 with my

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,610
boy Kristen here where we move over by

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,060
literally the most um correlated stuff

00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,340
ever

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,140
I think we're just the excited to seeing

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,409
or

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,110
the phone then I like a little bit of

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,840
HTML CSS with also some help from my

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,850
friend Kristin here then also than the

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,330
Udacity I live again the vernal Art of

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,080
Living

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,450
Justin boost quite simple skills on

00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,100
WordPress together was able to I was

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,920
able to deliver like poets that a client

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,090
would actually really like so tried all

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,240
of the source all in different systems

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,890
as well drill jump on the triple even

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,570
the gem though from a sense if any you

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,070
guys here at work imaginative day and I

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:01,740
out you really have my sympathy we're

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,330
pressed achieved by 60% of all CMS's of

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,860
a party noise so that's a pretty music

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,470
thing in a huge market share which is

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,769
why I love it so much so as poor as

00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,269
important to you I am is who have melt

00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:14,550
I'm not a designer as you're gonna see

00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:16,650
from this example of me today knowing

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,030
real passion about design I'm just

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,830
trying to show you the functionality for

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,430
a press API so it's gonna look pretty

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,570
nasty I'm not a PHP developer so even

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,860
though I thought one was a little bit of

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,720
PHP here and there it goes

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,880
par WordPress I would never describe

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,470
myself as like a Tom the PHP developer

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,950
it's just the WordPress makes it so damn

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,140
easy for us I'm not fond of playing Bach

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,860
and tennis or playing konjac tennis with

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,750
backends

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,610
poppins load Magento we fix something

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,989
they break it they go back to us we

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,549
bring it it just moves back and forth

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,100
and back and forth that doesn't happen

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,780
with WordPress a client comes to us they

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,060
get a really nice design from our design

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,230
team and I deliver a full scholar and no

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,579
need for going to back-end

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,670
because WordPress this makes it so easy

00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:58,049
for us importantly I'm not even smarter

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,209
than your average bear just like our

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:03,900
friend you here I'm definitely not no

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:07,079
huge PhD your monster is no model end of

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,970
training just working kind of with

00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,670
online resources unlearning as much as I

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,690
could but definitely not any smarter

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,280
than you want some straightness and

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,880
everything I can do you can do that I'm

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,320
sure just a quick note I toyed with the

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,880
idea of doing some light coating to make

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,010
this more

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,720
Marcin but if anybody is from they learn

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,330
at lunch Hiromi Widow here had a

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,730
Nintendo treated Mario Zelda he had an

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,770
epic fail doing a live demonstration of

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,780
e3 but five years ago and intended never

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,160
did one sense so three recordings good

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,570
enough friend Tendo is good enough for

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,740
me

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,240
let's get into this we've got a lot of

00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,590
stuff to cover today I just want to say

00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,480
thanks very much for everybody can come

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,250
it's a really great honor to be able to

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,750
give even something very small back the

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,240
community doesn't get such a huge

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,680
difference in my life

00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,670
so that's somewhat limited in using

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,320
world of WordPress API so initially I

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,120
met all of this like I wanted to take

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,000
you from like new code to a finished

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,500
product I made all those resources and

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,060
then I ended up having to go to them

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,830
because I did a time of it and it was

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,000
over an hour a half so I'm just going to

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,590
really quickly however through the

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,880
basics because we all use WordPress and

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,100
I'm sure you guys all probably knew

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,190
these times but this is a quick look at

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,400
them anyway let's get oldham going so

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,830
we've got just PHP x wrapped around or

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,570
press API on a thumbs up not magic

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,010
forest and we don't often worry too much

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,320
of like but it does some really cool

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,060
stuff we can call a to talk to as a ball

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,980
game folks or just buy you a plugin from

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,840
me and login to the description we can

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,820
pull out the name of the site the

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,080
description of this site same with title

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,850
and content you're plugging with the

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,380
title whatever push the pager on the

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,180
content of your booster page

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,620
ceiling panels that are inside bark

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,690
you're just pulling content to be

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,500
hammered PHP in your sidebar HP and your

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:48,200
footer so let's scoot past this so if I

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,540
give you quick example here we have our

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,910
deem or description or title in our

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,830
content packs area we just look up if we

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,270
just put them on the pH this is what we

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,880
would get name of our site our

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,640
description our title on our pH content

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,870
simple simple stuff so let's talk a

00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,970
little quick look at the featured image

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,760
a really nice feature WordPress that I

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,080
have been loving since day one I'm going

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,000
to click on video for you here you can

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,380
see I don't have any featured image here

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,910
it's not that it's hidden in the screen

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,710
options or anything it's just not there

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,270
committed nothing yet so we're going to

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,730
use square there are functions about PHP

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,480
I'd say op team support Polly some nails

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,670
that's it

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,500
that's all I have the odd luck on all of

00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,510
a sudden just by magic we have our

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,100
featured image here so I'm sure you guys

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,750
sure people have done this before even

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,520
if you're even if you're just a blogger

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,200
or whatever you should probably use your

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,180
featured image just going to upload it

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,050
really quickly I put in a picture of

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,900
Queens this is an example of a featured

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,580
image and it gives us a little bit of

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,680
feedback here it's on it and then we

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,480
head up did I'm all ready to move on so

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,340
that's not a quote and you can see the

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,260
front end we don't have anything yet

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,640
obviously because we have to go back

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,800
into our theme and then we're going to

00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,420
add the calls that we got so I'm just

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,700
creating and you can call featured image

00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,870
of the finder just drop it and then I'm

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,660
going to put into the post thumbnail

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,820
that's a little bit of API Lamar you

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,980
display the image object all our page

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,960
already looks a little bit nicer with

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,520
simpler and you can see that I've got a

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,160
designer right it's looking pretty nasty

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,900
so far but can we make this a little bit

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,800
smarter hopefully use the image to be a

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,360
little bit smarter

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,610
hey Gatsby pound we're going to use the

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,470
post thumbnail in URL so we're going to

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,210
get the address of where that image is

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,470
hell and then we can use it to style

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,720
around it to the make it look a little

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,180
bit nicer so I've got my father

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,960
dedicated here on this their operation

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,820
to hold it in place

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,590
and the pH so it doesn't become the full

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,470
width okay something special there and

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,990
then in the style tag I'm gonna pass in

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,000
my post thumbnail URL this time instead

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,550
of just the URL and then we'll stir on a

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,740
little tiny bit of CSS here just for the

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,730
bar to make it responsive is to me sighs

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,300
cover some like big colored white for

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,620
the h2 tag which is just about a content

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,550
we've put some hot emo not to make it

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,220
look a bit nicer

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,689
hey Preston just was about tiny bit of

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,819
CSS and a little bit

00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:05,249
safety I fulfilled a nice feature for

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,669
every page a little tougher the hustling

00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,709
of honor

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,569
instead of code 3 every page you go to

00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:13,439
and pull through the image I will bring

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:14,879
bring out the stomach title so the

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,979
problem with that is when we add

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,569
features to a site and then we have

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,879
clients for those features we get

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,729
trouble every single time so we're going

00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,019
to do it without in a little full lock

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,999
you can see this is exactly the same

00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,479
code except this time instead of having

00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:33,689
just plain fungal URL I'm just using PHP

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,519
to ask if it has a thumbnail then use

00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,439
the thumbnail but if not we're going to

00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,050
fall back to this this is a really nice

00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,149
API here our template directory that

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,489
gets the URL of our working template

00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:46,559
whatever we're using and then the IMG's

00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:49,769
a pool that I created just a normal

00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:50,369
image I'm Phil Murray is a picture of

00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,229
Bill Murray

00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,909
but it's Bill something out so if any of

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:55,379
you guys ever meet websites and they

00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:57,599
clunk the client which they never do

00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,159
never get any pictures we use use

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,159
placeholders nobody's Phil Murray

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,860
because it's a lot more fun so we can

00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:08,279
see that we have the code and plants

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,719
that are up here then if I put this by

00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,579
my inspector to those you can see that's

00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,939
nice and responsive but I was tiny bit

00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,739
of CSS does matter what size because up

00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:18,360
then also if we're completely Dodie

00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:20,759
clients and we remove the image or

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,559
forget to them we now have our film

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,559
re-fall like the beautiful motor self

00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:30,749
refresh the page and there is so even

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,610
though that even the dumbest of clients

00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:36,089
can't mess out of both of us which is a

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,889
great feature is exactly what we want so

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,599
that's a good custom fields next I said

00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,550
that each to title it was on the top of

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,839
our partner it's just static we don't

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,309
want to have the same thing coming in on

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,250
every single pH so we're going to use

00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:49,649
custom fields to meet that to make that

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,180
different for every page the wrong so

00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,800
you can see them and I have no custom

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,660
fields down here there is nothing in the

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,399
final plus because I've turned on just

00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,059
my screen options sometimes it's all by

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,589
default and then I go put it up I'm not

00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:02,800
into different types of custom field

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,090
here okay

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,250
idle who's obviously gonna replace that

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,990
father title and then I've also been

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,290
using a more interesting way I'm gonna

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,910
pull three of the seal type in so this

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,590
one is called Ian's let's pretend this

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,900
is a page where I'm making a list of all

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:20,720
my favorite video games okay so games

00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,100
Mario game Zelda theme splatoon I'm

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,960
gonna put up a big nintendo fanboys

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,630
wells where pressing Keys you'll notice

00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,430
so this one is going to be unique it's

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,800
only gonna be used once but this one is

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,170
going to be what we call an array like a

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,210
bunch of the same thing when we're going

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,790
to use them as a feature on this pH okay

00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,730
so I hit update here and that updates my

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,410
father or updates my post and then

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,510
there's two ways we can serve a populace

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,700
okay we can just use the old Central

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,410
Time no matter what bubble do is

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,750
literally just dump everything just like

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,550
Crocker whole I don't repeat so you can

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,380
see it's given us a booth of our custom

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,170
fields and it's also given us our

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,270
options from our custom or our values to

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,860
be given to the custom field I think

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,200
that's cool but it's not particularly

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,700
like a great feature just like that

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,010
so what we're going to do is improve

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,640
this with a little bit of PHP very very

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,830
simple PHP so this time we have the same

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,230
difficult meta but we're going to cover

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,640
the QP very local games I could really

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:23,390
do with longer arms or at least or

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,710
either lose an option okay so organ at

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,030
this time just create a PHP variable

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,120
called Ian's

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:31,850
it's not games can be populated by the

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,340
post meta that is I declared was called

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:37,370
even Murphy called for the vodka and

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,350
then for each of them and games we're

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,420
gonna act like one less item and it's

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,370
gonna be the iam also I put a little bit

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,750
of CSS in us just see connect I'm just

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,120
gonna put them into the sides I get some

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,280
sort of a sidebar okay and then we go

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,060
back with it from them and I have one on

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,830
the side we're here

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,590
right so I can be a really cool thing

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:58,260
like say for example you are doing your

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,880
your your crime is looking to make like

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,900
top fives they're doing like book

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,130
reviews or something in or anything that

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,840
they want sort of grouped together by

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,280
thought you can really easily make up

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,220
and then just give them like a little

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,690
list of different custom fields they can

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,320
use of the feature in each of the

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,510
templates

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,970
there's also quick shot to advance

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,920
custom fields plug-in which does this on

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,840
like a hopefully a slightly better way

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,850
but I thought just wanna stick to

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,290
WordPress API today but once I start

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,080
trying to cover plugins and that's what

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,280
was making like my things away plus we

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,080
have our next speaker here is going to

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,270
tell you I'm in a really cool bag called

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,190
toolset which also does this and then in

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,040
a sort of higher level on the also gives

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,880
you custom post types of food so well

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,830
here my pop next just in grid so the

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,550
minute this is a PDF like Jim but not as

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,560
we know it

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,940
this isn't all no longer like just as

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,500
found their needs we're starting to put

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,000
an extra features that are only going to

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,260
be unique to this template or maybe

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,510
another template that will make from

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,270
this so what we want to do is start to

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,010
use word presses page templates this is

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,870
brilliant this is something that like in

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,840
other systems so it's not like be a

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,310
machine but in other CMS's is really

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,110
freaking home bullard isn't difficult to

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,760
do and we're pressed just like

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,910
everything it's really really simple

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,440
okay so here's my pH Dolph PHP my

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,090
standard what every page should look

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,920
like on my site okay

00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,540
it has new templates in here that's

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,340
because I'm creative company yet and

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,110
it's literally this easy I'm just gonna

00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,850
paste it enough pocket it's all there

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,470
tempted the in custom layout you can

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,530
hope God custom laid whatever you want

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:33,060
it could be the comp I pH it could be

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,950
Bill's page it could be Pikachu's notes

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,690
anything you want to call it doesn't

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,470
matter but what you do need thing is

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,440
when you name it

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,570
prefix it in the end the template so I

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,280
called it custom template there it was

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,190
hot stuff - templates on this highly

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,050
talk daily two key ingredients so when

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,850
we refresh we go back in here and we're

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,420
going to refresh the page you'll see

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,580
them all the sudden way up there

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,800
here called template and you can see the

00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,110
knee and custom language is not PHP paga

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,980
to put at the top so I'm just going to

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,270
keep this on my PHP develop a pizzelle

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,680
PHP shouldn't have all these extra

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,680
features so I strip them all either

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,350
however really good think about that's

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,170
to make sure I don't miss anything if I

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,180
remember yeah strip I thought that I

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,060
hurry up though

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,440
impossible so yeah I start with all

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,510
these features because this is like each

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,010
dot PHP it's going to use this first on

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,540
their page and the client is gonna fit

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,700
all the cool stuff they want to the

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,560
content area so that we don't have to

00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,970
kind of deal with out there arm and then

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,860
you can see when I reload it it's moose

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,040
tune up or engage I want to change back

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,570
to my custom layer that we justified

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,520
comes back to our cool pendant we

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,740
building so that's a really powerful

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,030
tool what you want to do or what I don't

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,400
want to tell you guys what you want to

00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,960
do but what I do a lot of jobs is every

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,090
piece that is unique and has unique

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,590
features to it causes some comfit it

00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,910
means that the user can come back at the

00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,530
end they're like oh I want to make

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,360
another for another Phe social

00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,740
acceptance off site my contact form I'll

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,630
use the contact time they know I put

00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,400
extra stuff in the content area it's

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:05,170
just a really powerful and simple to

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,760
leave so just a note post completing is

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,890
just as easy we were looking at a page

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,080
template there you can use this for

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,820
posts as well so we just put the see if

00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,020
I get caught but this time we're going

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,300
to put an extra thing at the bottom

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,310
called template post type and we're

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,170
gonna put in post all they say if I need

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,910
a comma and put in page after that I

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,520
could use that template on page as well

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,590
if I need custom post types which maybe

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,000
might get runs into the next time and

00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,740
you custom post types like I'd get a

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,800
product post type or whatever you just

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,250
performed only I love whatever the

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,050
whatever this lovely or the of the post

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,610
pet days and you'll be able to call it

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,290
up in the scene exactly seeing my

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,050
thought that little amount of our or

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:48,630
metabolic box here and you just change

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:53,100
it so that's like a template parts what

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:55,500
we built the okay so here's what we

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,390
build for the Bonner okay this is good

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,399
because we built a really nice feature

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,750
for them for our site okay I'm not

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,430
trying to like make up my own code would

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,350
like this imagine this is a really well

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,209
developed feature okay but we've got

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,040
about nine and we're going to use it not

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:09,750
just on the homepage template not just

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,310
on the invite page template not just on

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,170
the contact we're gonna use this on ten

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,519
or fifteen different templates like I'm

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,130
working on the side of the minute or

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,779
like I think it's like pushing about

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,640
forty templates at the moment this is

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,459
such a huge site and everything is

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,110
bespoke on each page so if I wanted to

00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,850
use off and I put that code at the top

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,440
of every one of those templates the

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,570
client comes back too many years prime

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,459
he goes I want to change this part of

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,290
the template part of the banner and I'm

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,940
like thinking oh my god where did I use

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,560
that code like I'm doing through each of

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,570
these files or servicing them at the

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,820
elements one absolutely neck Merida of

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,920
dick so what we do is we see this on you

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:50,820
as a PHP file they just called honored

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:52,649
of PHP and we're gonna do that but if

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,440
you some more wordpress api and cola

00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:58,050
violin so all the time at the top here

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,480
is put if I get template Park bomber as

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,670
fighting back men goes no template mark

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,790
Bohnert very tall we don't need to write

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,470
enough PHP actually just API does not

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,290
and it grabs that file and puts it at

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,459
the top so then when I use that and ten

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,230
different files are twenty different

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:15,060
files the client comes back in a year's

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,800
time and I changed one file and a bowl

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,649
of the templates are updated so it's

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,970
just a part PHP really comes not trying

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,529
to say that WordPress is due to this

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,730
like peach peach doing it but WordPress

00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:28,839
uses are about API use mixer

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,730
easy to do so that's quite a lot of

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,730
stuff I'm talking boss because I'm

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,339
worried at work so let me do a quick

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:41,350
recap as nobodies enjoy about to eat

00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:43,000
tuna copy of nuke sold seriously so

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,680
we're pressing yacht we looked at the

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,300
blog info using the site in the

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,269
description so obviously like if you

00:16:46,300 --> 00:17:00,010
make a theme it's not gonna it's there's

00:16:49,269 --> 00:17:02,019
not ten minutes for me obviously the

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,399
next person's Lulu comes to the next

00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:06,309
person's title comes through the top

00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,839
okay so we live in pH title content

00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,689
which obviously will be unique to every

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,459
page is loaded on every post the sidebar

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:15,699
doesn't mention that one using a

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,620
featured image is the URL custom fields

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,360
is well we looked at peach boost and

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,520
templates you think to have eight parts

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,020
I would know I like the apologize for

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,429
anyone being as a seasoned developer

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,809
that was probably a little example for

00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,579
you the next parts a bit more

00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,200
interesting on the final part I think

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,049
might actually there might be something

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,340
even from on crystal aircrew notes so

00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,530
the next part right giving the client

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,360
more control the client always wants to

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,980
have control over the sites that we

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,600
build for them they don't want to be

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,919
coming back to us for regular

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,340
maintenance for a really really simple

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,600
stuff so these couple of tools will sort

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,940
of make things a little bit easier for

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,559
them first up we've got short codes I'm

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,540
sure everyone's used to short code here

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,950
anyone who goes on top forms on their

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,929
site is probably using the square

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,299
bracket contact form seven square

00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,890
bracket we can actually just make our

00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:03,880
own store codes so then we can have

00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,950
content on it and pry the control over

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,020
content that is code bases we thought

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,330
about being able to see or more money

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,970
break the code so we can save a little

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,419
chunks and we find music so here's an

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,530
example that I've been any designers

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:20,169
care any friends when you see this

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,909
example here's it

00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:24,190
other leagues outplayed me of like a

00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:26,200
little offer the clients going to offer

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,149
and how the call to action at the bottom

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,980
so every time they are having a special

00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,929
product they can fire in this and then

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,029
they can cut a little call to action it

00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,590
has some simple CSS it just adds local

00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,950
problems of awkward image get ready to

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,289
cringe designers so this looks like our

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,269
content finishes and then this comes in

00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,620
but they fine cut controller they don't

00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,360
know they can put that anywhere that

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,039
wanted me to wanted of every single

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,110
piece so what we're going to do is keep

00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,940
that HTML with me and uh we're going to

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,580
minify it if you have a part of that

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,200
expression before just google HTML then

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,580
a fire and it just takes a lot of each

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,600
tip mallet makes it a bit more big long

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,100
line with no spaces here we go surviving

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,470
that our function is called PHP where

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,700
all the magic popping some more press

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,320
you can see our proof some nails is

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,860
still here just underneath we're gonna

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,750
add in our odds shortcode API and then

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,340
we're gonna call it where it come demo

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,899
that's actually higher than what the

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,120
user will use to call it's on the other

00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:22,389
side and then we're gonna name our

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,220
function here which is we're confident

00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:26,380
with shortcode obviously you can tell

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,149
anything without forward come is just

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,409
for you to be in you don't need to see

00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:31,450
naming conventions there's going to be

00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:33,669
called other network bump and all this

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,220
does is I think what you saw this in the

00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:38,320
previous one just here it's burning your

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,960
HTML here the minute what we're gonna do

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,630
is piece our HTML code over here you see

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,850
about so that's what excitement we have

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,250
our short code here with our HTML on it

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,019
and then what they can do is if other

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,580
user is they can just put it in wherever

00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:54,360
they want so it's not gonna be below the

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:59,019
contents will be part of the content

00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,700
they can hopefully great deal call the

00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:03,190
action anything anywhere they walk on

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,330
their website and you can make up if you

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,549
had a lot of problems so there's a

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,950
common feature so I got in the site what

00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:10,330
you can do would be really

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,920
like a little library for them a little

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,640
short coos and then they can pop them

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,410
kind of like whatever they want right so

00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,110
the minute where we're starting to get a

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:22,150
bit of a messy function stuff PHP which

00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,010
isn't something I'm not fond of like

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,530
you're kind of like my functions off

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,940
page be super clean mainly because I

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,410
want to scroll through super powers and

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,420
lines of code at the end of a project

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,320
but also because the next developer who

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,700
takes it off me

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,350
it doesn't want to do that either they

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,880
were like okay I would open this I want

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,670
to please stop I want to take this site

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,520
so I like to store everything and then i

00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:45,940
NC bull versus the bull do I think I

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,920
just need to learn and then all of my

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,400
function stop each week so the system

00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,050
and I said it uses this include and then

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,910
because as we saw earlier on get a

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,370
template directory against our octave

00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,800
template and then include folder on

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,390
short code of PHP so that just means I'm

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,070
not looking at all of my code in one

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,560
place so it means like keep it separated

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,270
right which is a lot cleaner

00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,800
so that's funny that the widget area is

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,150
as long as we start to add all this

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,420
stuff in you would see the function

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,100
speech penis scrolling on kids so that's

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,810
a better widget areas what we're going

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,850
to do about two different which there

00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,650
isn't here you can add as many as you

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,700
want reason I put into is just to show

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,860
you that you could just take this

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,470
cooking coffee and piston as many as you

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,750
want it's a really good I'm sure routing

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,310
of widget area is here but it's why you

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,050
sort of drag and drop with a user

00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,660
interface different like chunks of code

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:37,360
in obviously go to plugins use widgets

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:41,260
as well like which is great so we have

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,780
our we're just going to option here word

00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,920
widgets a network um that's that's what

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,110
we need to tell that's going to be a

00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,440
widget this is our what we defined here

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,660
work

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,430
and then that calls our function up here

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,440
it's register C's you'll see that these

00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,600
are both the seal but they both have

00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,400
unique Miam of a unique ID and that's

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,050
really important the nyan is for the

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,700
user so they know where they're putting

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,170
the widgets the idea is for us the

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,740
developer so that we can call the right

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:08,180
one so back in our site part of PHP

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,990
where there's a static content there

00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:14,600
here we have a quick if to see if their

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,130
sidebar widgets ID is active and if it

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,460
isn't one of the spy or widget or

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:21,830
dynamic sidebar sidebar widgets we fill

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,030
up and then let's you can see you come

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,190
back from the front of the site but

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,780
there's nothing here because I've also

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,010
separated this so I did a few columns

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,900
knowing but there is nothing new

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,490
actually I'm out of them this is a great

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,560
one fishery that I've separated that

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:38,450
mean content area with 7% unreflective

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:42,050
30% for my sidebar there's the active

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:44,450
code it's going to run here is my

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,770
sidebar this book down as well where we

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,080
talked about the if statement and

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,040
importantly the ID go to get the ID

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,980
right you're going to call their own

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,440
thank you three or more called monthly

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,660
then we go back to our wordpress oh

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,210
sorry the last thing about the day boys

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:01,190
it's from bhaktir functions PHP and make

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,560
sure it'll be call it not extra PHP file

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,570
that we've been inside the Inc folder so

00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,170
again that including time we're gonna

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,270
see it again

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:11,750
or get found a directory really really

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:14,650
good to get sir octave template then the

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,650
actual address

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:35,140
seems like I'm typing really so actually

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,230
pretty terrible what was actually pretty

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,940
so we go back and we

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,040
here here which is going to be the

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,230
custom or our widgets area and that's

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,910
because we've initialized widgets

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,990
WordPress is like hey this guy's can use

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,880
widgets I'm going to put this in the

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,430
area in here we're using the drag and

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,560
drop some some widgets in but again

00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,570
which it's a really powerful it is these

00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,670
are just the default or press ones that

00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:59,800
I'm sure everybody's seen well there's

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,270
also like a whole library of plugins

00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,980
like if you want to pull your clear to

00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,740
their about a good while you go to

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:09,970
search for is Twitter widget plug-in

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:12,430
and there it's just so you just

00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,870
everything see you is what I'm gonna do

00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,480
the first part of artistic got very

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,920
confused then we go back and refresh

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,320
side but you can see we've got a new

00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,030
sidebar area over which is three and two

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,410
which is create fine slows up because

00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,330
then they can play with them on

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,190
experiment and if you do is not just

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,870
always in the sidebar but in different

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,080
parts of the site they really like that

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,780
that they can put in their own stuff so

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,310
you also just say that the federal agent

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,470
is going to be cold in there and you can

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:41,830
add in just call the MPS Coby jihad in

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,790
as many widget areas as you want so the

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,920
next thing I want to look out really

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,870
briefly is menus that's a really nice

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,480
bar fulfilled you'll see here that I

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,730
don't have a navigation bar but I have

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,220
made a little ages just like pretty much

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,930
as low or maximal news pages but I want

00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:59,290
to make a navigation so that everybody

00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,790
can get to those pages I experienced

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,500
that when I first started my job people

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,090
were doing this topically I just

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,190
couldn't understand why it's like the

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,720
clients comes bhakti it takes was like

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,730
I've made five new pages

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,310
I'm gonna put them up so we put in our

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,540
WP now menu either for me I call that

00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,940
work

00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,290
again this is just a look at the CSS

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,030
it's going to part it super simple

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,200
there's just a couple of C elements to

00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,090
make this draw flowers that I'm going to

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,500
show you the very reasonable CSS as well

00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:27,120
but yeah so it's a black pine cone back

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,530
moving that they want to see you know

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
they're do five pages they bought it and

00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:34,470
now far this just gives them a really

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,730
amazing user interface that they can we

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,280
go back in here we're going to make a

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,900
new menu from our parents menu chemical

00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,330
or a compass up with the ID to be

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:49,680
assigned to I'm just going to drop in

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:51,480
all the peaches here so dropping all the

00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,980
pages and then you can see that I can

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,450
drive you drop these are on a really

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,060
cool feature as well as I can change

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,190
that they hi that was too long for an

00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,570
obligation I can change it to hope that

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,790
doesn't change the address of the page

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,320
the URL it doesn't change the title of

00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,330
the page it just changes it for the

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,950
mouth which is a nice feature I can also

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,840
drag and drop because these are children

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,340
pages of WordPress so I can drive them

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,310
in so they're gonna set this children

00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:18,570
pages I'm not tiny bit advice to CSS

00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:23,250
there will will have to work so you can

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:27,180
see we've just pulled up really nicely a

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,680
little bit of css3 first transition yeah

00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,620
that's a really nice kind of harmful to

00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,710
as well so this is the thing that I you

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,940
don't see you nice and on sites

00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,960
itea and use it really well but low I

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,850
don't think they're far but we're

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,040
oppressed but it's a thing so that

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,780
whatever you write up a post if you have

00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,030
local bloggers like my friend Matthew

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,560
here a bragança some website but with

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,090
multiple offers on this is a really

00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,950
great feature that at the end of the

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,680
post it'll tell you a little bit about

00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,960
that person who's been the article so

00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,080
you can see here this is my information

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,610
on my horrible work photograph they

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,519
maybe do it for here it's usually a

00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,169
picture of a pencil

00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,559
but they made me put on my professional

00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:07,509
ones they says I hit so this is

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:09,789
information about me I look up a bio

00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:14,799
here I've got my website address

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:17,499
I go mini and so really really again

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,599
super simple API code that allows me to

00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:22,080
do really cool powerful things that's

00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,269
all I did for bio a couple pick in there

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:29,080
I'm going to grab my avatar using my IDs

00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:30,820
mic we're using my emails my ID then I'm

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,909
going to say find out more about the

00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,889
author's name iam description which was

00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:37,389
that bio and then I'm gonna have a

00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:39,279
little thing saying you can contact me

00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:41,829
via and then that link is just dropping

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:45,070
my URL that I put in there or on my

00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:46,899
website so at the end of every blog post

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,909
every author will have there will be

00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,979
unique things show up there find more of

00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:51,459
my build by more white prison by more by

00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:53,229
month

00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:54,849
whoever it is leave that picture it will

00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:56,529
be there by oh I think it's a really

00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:58,320
nice feature to use on sites especially

00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:00,879
for use in a football game

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,739
so we've got that's pretty far through

00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:05,169
this I'm the next little bit I'll just

00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:08,049
read top this I think we looked at using

00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:10,929
custom short codes we looked at widget

00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:13,179
areas we looked at WP knobs you're

00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,549
making nice interactive navigation menus

00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:17,829
we don't think alter details which I

00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:19,479
also like cosine off because it's like a

00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:22,229
nice way that like say like have a

00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:24,639
sign-off at the bottom or a cold auction

00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:26,169
okay another last thing I look on

00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:27,969
there's anyone who's really seasoned

00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:29,679
developer I hope I didn't bore you too

00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:30,789
much for the simple stuff that I was

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,440
really aware there's gonna be a

00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:33,940
different range of abilities here and

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,440
there's nothing I hate more than going

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,999
to talk on someone just dives into the

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,589
deep end I'm sitting there going what

00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:40,419
the heck were you talking about and

00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:41,469
getting nothing from this so thanks for

00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,999
bearing with me if you're a very

00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:45,820
seasoned theme developer but this should

00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:49,880
be pretty Co this is uh being introduced

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,710
in WordPress 4.5 so the WP custom

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,679
allows us to literally customize

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,910
everything on our site and it's also

00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,289
gonna wrap up all the other stuff we

00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,390
kind of talked about so far

00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:01,940
so in our functions.php we're going to

00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,429
activate this by putting in action

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,350
customize register we're gonna call it

00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:09,710
again work from customize register which

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,179
I'm sure you can guess is just the key

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,580
and that may not be cool with everyone

00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:17,650
then we go in the back and within a new

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,429
area come up here on customize so

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,960
because the thing about this is

00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,780
everything we kind of talked about so

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,000
far is my controllable from one place so

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,740
the user is going to be looking excited

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,650
Anthony Jeremy talked about they've log

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,570
into both the title and the tagline when

00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,340
they open they're seeing a line of it

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,140
that this happens you know like as we

00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,610
type it in we're going to get to see why

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,980
this is going to affect our site and

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,950
then we can add publish we go back to

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,020
the front end that will actually be

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,030
iPhoto environment from them so no we're

00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,650
going to print look at the menus you can

00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,120
control your menus in there after widget

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,820
areas we just see it you can control

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,350
them from there you can even have a look

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,330
at the home page settings where you can

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,039
change it from being a global page to

00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:00,620
static page from which is what I did

00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:02,720
earlier and then we'll see you cannot in

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,190
CSS here which is really good because a

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,380
lot of clients are going to want a week

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:08,809
month or 15 year old nephew who's

00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,270
encoding with a bit of a pebble mr. site

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:12,890
okay that's great because he can fit a

00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,870
little bit here as you can see I've been

00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,179
an evolving time and I say explained on

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:18,080
instantly it takes a side away he's not

00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,580
playing the molding

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,350
means they can fiddle around in there

00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,270
and they can have you CSS with what

00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,650
getting near your core CSS and

00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,690
completely breaking your site and then

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,679
blaming you for it so it's really good

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,360
that you can kind of have a quick

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,789
experimentation there I can see a live

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,990
feed but what's even cooler or not

00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:34,640
because that is pretty awesome

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,490
but you can actually add more features

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,280
to it so we're going to look at the moo

00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:43,250
moo here which is a really nice feature

00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,490
this is some not to be borrowed HDMI or

00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,380
look about these be more doing here's

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,419
again

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,890
being support for a custom pattern is it

00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:52,690
is what they call it and then we're

00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,150
going to lose some defaults here is an

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,340
array of our defaults up here so we have

00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,470
again of the film Murray fall back just

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,049
because some of them something in there

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,789
I'm around them default set defaults we

00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:06,059
put in a bowl of different defaults and

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:08,350
husband likes cycle through that okay -

00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:10,600
then width and height I just wanted to

00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:13,000
be 156 this time and there's a little

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,500
bit there like things you a lot of other

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,210
settings you can put in there and you

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,919
can also put in whatever you want the

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,190
pillow to the front end to which I will

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,460
shoot you then the next thing we have to

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,080
do is go to there are functions PHP and

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,090
called up file because I'm sorry

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,510
completely skip out but we made it our

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,919
new file open loop HP again inside this

00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:37,270
thing folder where I like to keep on

00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:39,970
with code and then we go to the header

00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,049
on PHP we qualify so it's just as normal

00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,480
anybody you've done any type of

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:45,460
government at all this IMG comic very

00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,049
very simple it looks very excite group

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,900
it on the four 9s that's just so I can

00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:51,669
assess them I can see I'm sorry sure you

00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,880
get a little bit easier okay so with our

00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:56,380
source our polarized PHP header image to

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,990
mother actually gonna pull at the URL

00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,400
not image we have the height and this is

00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,130
where you can sort of activate anything

00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,080
you want so the high key say echo get

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,299
custom header and then whatever the

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,429
value you assign enough so when we apply

00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:11,770
any weight going on then all is this a

00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:14,950
little time that I always odd just gives

00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,539
us good practice for accessibility then

00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,880
what we got the front man we have Phil

00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:22,630
Murray looking a bit grumpy there he is

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,010
our Lulu for the pump our site but the

00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,690
cool thing is we can go in here now

00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,330
because this controllers come into the

00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,910
scene place where Mitchell

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:32,730
from so we can go in here we can pick

00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:35,400
out a new image I already hung one in

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,840
here but if it wasn't 150 by 150 it

00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,280
brings up the cropping tool and then you

00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,720
can crop it to be whatever size you want

00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,600
there's another really nice feature for

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,010
press Island the a life without hitting

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,510
there for us and then if we have

00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,490
published up at the top you can see the

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,260
change that we made inside this editor

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,120
are actually pulled through to the live

00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:54,720
site it's like updating our code for us

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,200
which is quite simply amazing there we

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,690
go

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,460
so the next bit is even cooler than that

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,980
but this is where it's actually getting

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,140
beyond my area of expertise in PHP I

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,060
would call myself PHP developer as I

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,770
said or Eric but all this code is all

00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:12,270
right there for you in the WordPress

00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,760
documentation I'm just there for you to

00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,320
sort of use pretty much I hate the set

00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,820
the copy of this it's kind of like a

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:27,060
funny thing you say I work all the time

00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:28,440
I call the IPS I web developer but we're

00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,980
gonna make a new file here well the

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,330
theme colors HP ok so this is broken

00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,440
into two slides here because I couldn't

00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,330
fit all along but I'll show you the

00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,730
venue next anyway but what we're going

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:41,880
to do here is a cert function that was

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,230
called whenever we setup or customize

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,330
the first place so we're calling this

00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,220
function we're making an array called

00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,909
colors and then each of these is an

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,979
array

00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:52,139
a different color see you see there's a

00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:54,209
slug which is our ID what we as

00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:56,009
developers Nicola we have a default

00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:58,469
which we can set that any color of the

00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:01,019
bike we have a label which the user will

00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:04,019
see whenever they are saying from them

00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:05,519
and then don't you see me gasps constant

00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,749
work cowbell so you can change that

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,690
label to be so they're grouped together

00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:10,919
you can not change up to do it everyone

00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,690
then thud opponent we're going to loop

00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:15,000
through each of them so panic so these

00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,649
settings and controls that this is the

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,960
proper high copy I can slide web

00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:19,819
developer job just got less straight

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,519
from the from the WordPress

00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:26,429
documentation yeah everything just works

00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,559
so much easier than words and then the

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:30,389
final the final importance of this it is

00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,669
a very last thing we're going to do is

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:34,500
see if PHP variables that we're gonna

00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,299
pull through from get option header

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,460
color and then we're gonna cost these

00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:40,349
into your style bike this importantly

00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,359
should be below your call your CSS

00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:44,639
because the two were writing the CSS

00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,990
over in the first place so the cool

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,210
thing is you can kind of can come to get

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:51,299
these together as well this one that I

00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:53,700
give am idea of header BT color but the

00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:55,649
users gonna see the tie me and theme

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,900
color so I can have the header in the

00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:00,089
sidebar like any headers we want them to

00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,339
take off me in theme we can have them

00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:03,809
all can come in there and then we also

00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:06,180
have to steal their two settings as well

00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:08,819
the header on the footer or the entry a

00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,980
is any link that's gonna be in there so

00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:13,349
just go quickly to the demonstration oh

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,819
yes sorry and then one last time we have

00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:18,599
to include governor come to install PHP

00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:20,190
otherwise no Craig knows it exists so we

00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,630
go back to someone looking a little our

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,099
code is you know that it's not anything

00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,420
different what I do we just showed on

00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:27,119
the screen and not people were saying

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,859
there's our functions there's how split

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,509
into two slides store where we could fit

00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:32,339
all of the school going so you can see

00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:35,990
though and here's our header with the

00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:39,210
exact C and PHP variables of style five

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:43,710
and then we go back into our customize

00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:46,650
area we have a new Aryans of the nook

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:50,670
called colors you click it about and

00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:52,830
then the clients oh I would probably

00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,500
exercise some sort of here

00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:56,880
because you give them given the ability

00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,619
to change every color in the rainbow and

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,300
they will use every fully colored area

00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,930
boat sir

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,150
every since like uh maybe slightly

00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,440
cartoon like creative picture book yeah

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,790
you can see that they give us a life

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,020
update just like what was on there

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,000
feature styles which is a really cool

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,589
thing the WordPress school of the

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,380
Federative RTC in here but once they

00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:20,310
change the color it pops in nicely then

00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,380
we can see that so so many controls to

00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,540
change everything about the site and

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,740
it's all in one place so either the

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,630
client is going to be looking at a page

00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,339
or a post enough where they're going to

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,050
control the content that your post

00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,550
anything else they're going to be

00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,960
controlling from this one area you don't

00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,280
have to treat them to go oh and you'll

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,510
have to get this who did this part but

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,220
you want to go to this part of this part

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,380
everything is going to be controlled

00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,089
from one place which is just a really

00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,330
really good product to give a client as

00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:47,160
an end product so but with you may be

00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:51,920
asking yourself how does all of that

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,920
work and there is only one I'm sure it's

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,300
will be expelled all these features

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,680
workers you kinda blew my mind with your

00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,660
talk there know the important thing is

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,280
guys we don't need to know why it works
