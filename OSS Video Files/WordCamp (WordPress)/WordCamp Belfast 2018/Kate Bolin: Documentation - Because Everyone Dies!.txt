	00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,000
so I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:13,630
documentation because I hate to tell you

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,059
this everyone dies you think it give a

00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:27,009
of us then for your projects are going

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:30,369
to first it is okay if you fall asleep

00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:32,950
it's the end of the day it's hot

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:34,780
you've been busy listening to lots of

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,570
things I know when I'm at a conference

00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,320
I'm just trying to kind of stand all day

00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,320
and if I sit down like five minutes I

00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,750
doze off so I'm not gonna be offended I

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,329
totally get it

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:54,039
secondly it's okay if you can't quite

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:57,399
understand me I grew up in Los Angeles

00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:01,289
and then New Orleans then I moved to

00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:07,960
Navajo and now I'm here in Belfast I

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:10,030
know my English is not your English come

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,260
get me afterwards we'll try to make it

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,630
make sense so start out I have two

00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,050
stories these are things that happen to

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,820
me

00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,070
like we said I've directed my first

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,460
website maybe five I've been working in

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:28,960
the business since about 2000 a lot of

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:33,490
terrible companies the first one was I

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:37,120
was temping for a job for our CSS design

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:39,040
job the designer had broken his collar

00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,290
bone in an accident and could not type

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,080
and they desperately needed to get this

00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,710
website done urgently they needed

00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,350
somebody to come in and be able to do it

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,670
this was in 2004 so when CSS knowledge

00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:57,540
was not so hot but I wasn't given

00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,310
something like that I was given

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,580
beautifully laid out code he had

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,650
comments and explained

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,980
but if each single bit did he had

00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,170
everything organized file perfectly and

00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,330
I learned more about CSS in those two

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:14,390
weeks and I had the years before because

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,410
he just documented everything so damn

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:21,860
well I don't know who that guy is

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:25,430
I loved him too my second one

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,350
it was a developer he this was when I

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,270
was working for a tiny e-commerce shop

00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,960
and I was in charge of all of the front

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,040
end stuff

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,470
Avni outsourced to all the back end the

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,840
development the hosting and had a

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,250
problem with her website it was down we

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,310
were losing tens of dog pounds to tens

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,400
of pounds my god it was completely

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:53,150
broken and we kept them trying to call

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,980
the or the owner and if we're trying to

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,060
get the developer involved we didn't

00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,180
like what's happening what's happening

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,250
what's happening the site's down and it

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,070
turned out that the one guy in the

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,440
company who knew everything who was

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:11,780
responsible for any society who had all

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:14,270
the skills was bit by a dog and bit my

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,280
dog on his hands to the point of needing

00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:19,220
stitches and you could not take four

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,040
weeks to get our site back up he had to

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,200
go in stand there and tell them how to

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,880
fit to the site while basically going

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,500
like this bad documentation that the my

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,420
site they can go back up and I got

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,800
yelled at for the whole tens of mountain

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:39,530
we lost so documentation is incredibly

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,610
important it's incredibly important to

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,400
you you are also important to you this

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,390
is why you should document stuff it

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,500
gives you a reminder of what you've done

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:58,600
how do I do this what magic was this was

00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:02,300
you're never gonna have to go was nice

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,030
what am I just done and it also tells

00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,590
you what things connect to that way you

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,150
don't look at a piece of code you did

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:13,400
five years ago and go I have no memory

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,380
of what I've just done here okay magic

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,070
what if I change something I approach

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,739
and everything Oh God so it gives you a

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,470
reminder of exactly what you've done it

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:27,800
gives you a process this way you know

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,950
that when you make the game it will

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,900
affect B and then that will produce C

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,540
because you're breaking all down exactly

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,760
what it does and that means that if it

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,490
does go wrong you could go

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,740
I wrote down where they're wrong last

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,530
time I'm not gonna do that again next

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,950
time it's gonna go like this because you

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:52,550
remember how it all works and above all

00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,980
it gives you proof you don't know how

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,230
many people I know who have two are

00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,240
suddenly told write up what you've done

00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:03,979
for the week and have absolutely no

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,990
memory just go I need something but look

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,690
it shows you look at all the work you've

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,340
done look how much you've grown over the

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:16,460
years I mean if we look at back at my

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:19,669
web site in 1995 dams and basically it

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,620
means that if you go to your job your

00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:25,070
performance review or you go to a new

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:29,300
job you can go look at everything I've

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,290
done give me all the money they might

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,030
not give it to you but you've got

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:36,950
evidence and it's very important to

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,270
everybody you work with I'm not just

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,919
talking about your boss I'm talking

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,080
about your co-workers I'm putting that

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,280
your employees I'm talking about people

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,630
you don't even know

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,220
yet but we'll be touching your coat

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,850
they're also important to them they have

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:56,060
their own lives they need you to be

00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:59,120
better to document it gives them the

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,540
support that they need what works where

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,250
how does everything connect but above

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,120
all else they don't have to bother you

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,540
anymore

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,580
I don't be personally I hate bothering

00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,870
people I know you don't believe that was

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,740
Church I hate to ask people what have

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,780
you done here

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,270
oh is this broken how can I fix it

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,570
because I don't want them to think that

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,860
I can't fix it for them I don't what to

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,310
have to ask them how things have

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,590
happened

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,320
I just want to be able to do it good

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,240
documentation I can just do it I don't

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,070
have to bother people especially holiday

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,020
finally you finally have two weeks in a

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,790
beautiful place do you really want to

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,800
get that phone call of somebody who is

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,889
apparently just learning how to change

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,240
one CSS file

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:52,340
you don't documentation and that gives

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,100
them the understanding you want

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,410
everybody to be on the same level you

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,470
want people to understand exactly what

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:04,550
you're doing and then that way you can

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:07,820
all work together you get how they get

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,039
how you're working they understand they

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,560
can then build upon that to make even

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:18,770
more neat things and everybody's on the

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,400
same level or improving together and for

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,950
management

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,039
it gives them what it is they know what

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:27,380
you're doing they know how hard you have

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,289
worked but not you have worked so hard

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,539
why don't you show it to them and then

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,030
they throw all the money at you and if

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:38,870
they don't then another company will

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,729
throw all the money in you and I know a

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,150
lot of people go oh god no this is too

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,220
hard

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,910
I can't cope I don't ever want to do

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,970
documentation no it actually

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:53,230
is really easy you don't need to be

00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:55,030
writing ethnic manuals no I've done that

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,810
you know what nobody reads them it's

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,820
horrible you document what you work you

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,480
don't have to comment out every single

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:08,740
line you don't have to provide a giant

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,470
manual just wait little explain what's

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,080
going on this particular bit of code

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:17,470
creates a bucked that's two left and

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:23,860
it's blue and if you put it in here it

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:25,750
turns green that's it then if you want

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,380
to you can document after you're done

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:31,420
you can produce the bigger picture

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,820
overarching giant detailed manual

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,169
it can also that can really help you

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
because then you can don't look back at

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,620
what you've done taking those little

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:44,770
bits of comments and go oh if I had done

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,940
this bit first I wouldn't have had to

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:50,710
spend days on that stupid part because

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,820
you can understand how it's been working

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,560
and then also briefing someone else you

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,300
know the rubber duck Theory where you

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,530
tell your bugs your rubber ducks or

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,450
understand what you've done

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,290
so it's a second person you're talking

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:07,510
to talk to a real person

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,390
you tell them what's going on you figure

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,130
out together how things work and maybe

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,840
you'll pick up these things maybe

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,460
they'll think that these things maybe

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,200
you guys will come together and then

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,510
create the next multi-million dollar

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
super project because you just talked

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:26,110
about that tiny bit of code it could

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,510
happen so why is that because you know

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:34,900
some again you know it is it is it shows

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,940
you what you've been doing it shows your

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,100
co-workers it shows your boss

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,750
well if open source projects hell it

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,340
shows the entire world what you want you

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,680
want people to know that you are making

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:53,890
fantastic stuff and why not tell them

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,060
why or even better why not just be left

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,550
alone

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,780
by not having 10 people question you

00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,340
about things because it's all right

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,170
there

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,780
you can either be showing off or you can

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:09,400
be left alone you can do both with

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:13,000
documentation so if you have any

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,420
questions you can I knew was under 10

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,510
minutes

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:21,010
hot damn I'm on Twitter I don't

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,660
recommend following weeks it's literally

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:28,540
pictures the cat that hangs up I would

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:30,310
go up your engine go team and if you're

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,850
you can find me tomorrow I'll be at my

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:45,820
stand any time you have questions now is

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:47,080
the chance to eric documenting that or

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,790
not I'm gonna have to go back and watch

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:54,700
the video of this document some big

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:59,110
benefits the phone call Thursday

00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:03,790
afternoon we're on the beach while

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:23,110
you're making Easter dinner and I said I

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:25,870
have the first question what exactly is

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,510
documentation it could be anything that

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,410
explains what you've done because I

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,890
would have thought it could be

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:35,500
everything from comments on a lot of

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:38,710
code to engage the mid message to the

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:42,130
true life story of Thomas Ward article I

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:45,070
know you've done that thing it can't I

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,680
always like because basically most of

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,150
the time I come into a project it's

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,580
after somebody's left and there's

00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:56,650
nothing and anything that remotely

00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,480
resembles documentation is therefore a

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:03,850
godsend so yeah you can it's all

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,860
dependent upon how what you need to do

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,690
during the process

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,920
you're making something a lot of people

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,070
go I don't have time to think about

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,440
document again you have five seconds to

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,490
write a comment it'll help you in the

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,770
end in the morning they'll help you

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:20,040
anyway or you might have you might get

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,530
lucky and you might have a proper sprint

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,030
system where you have the meeting

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,240
afterwards where you go over everything

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,930
is done and those minutes if you want to

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,270
take minutes

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,640
the minute you can take minutes and that

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,860
can be your documentation on it so

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,990
basically there's a lot of opportunities

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,060
that you just need to go you know since

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:45,210
we're talking about this let's just

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:46,890
write it down I can empathize as well

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,050
with sometimes when I write to

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,880
documentation before I pleasure a soap

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,590
opera English I write just bullet point

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,380
notes with very short hands and not

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,150
single person people the in terms of the

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,340
writing documentation are there any

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,450
things you would recommend not do things

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,980
to avoid it balls giant paragraphs

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,980
phenomena you know how you start out

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,300
people bullet point and that's fine

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,100
oftentimes that's all you need you might

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,060
want to maybe expand that to a sentence

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,210
I actually just wrote a guide for our

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,090
resellers on data protection keeping it

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,160
very vague so I know I'm not a lawyer

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,840
and I started up I just basically

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,640
bullet-pointed everything I knew I

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,530
needed to put in there and then most of

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,350
the time it was just turning it into a

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,400
proper sentence and it was done if you

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,790
know that you want to talk people

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,730
through a particular process ordered

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,760
list one two three four click click

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,860
click go immensely save so much people

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:49,740
so much fun they go wait wait where do I

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:51,180
go and don't forget final names take

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,380
this is the book that tells you

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,770
everything

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:59,540
pushing documentation for you um usually

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,490
most of my documentation is that it

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,970
would be internal so it sits on our

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:09,020
internal confluence site which very

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:12,440
clearly said this is this thing but

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:15,050
other times if it's say a manual for

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,460
customers it goes up in all the

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,730
appropriate channels that they people

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,710
might see it if it's a project that we

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,530
worked out of a burly crowd up we'll put

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,330
a blog post about it going hey check

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,920
this out this is all the stuff it does

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,930
here's where we might have had some

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,580
snacks but we totally got it sorted

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,560
because we're cool and this is how we're

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,120
cool but you then treat that like an

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,760
intercom and artifact where you think

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,520
come back to it six months ago today or

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,230
has that gone stale or is it really just

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,140
you're extending like a Content team

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:49,910
around documentation or is this the

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:51,350
content to you sometimes I do go back to

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,870
it sometimes I got well no that's how it

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,640
was at that time and if I were to go

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,860
back and fix it then I'm going to put

00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,600
something new up because things have

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,790
changed which is the big thing to say

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,770
well you know back then that's how it

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:07,060
worked we've had to make some changes

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,650
here are all the changes now that works

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,570
anybody questions ask you may be related

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,040
to what columns asked there with that so

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,870
you said all of your stuff is internal

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,950
documentation I presume nice processes

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:20,270
the way your team works with it yes so

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,660
therefore I presume time would change

00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,580
freaks are over time oh I guess

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,540
revisited

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:31,120
it changes so my best example is for

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,040
some reason WordPress and our blog and

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,830
our servers don't like to talk to each

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,720
other but you can be much too much so

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,220
you have to change your host bus so you

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,380
go to the state keeps numbers you can

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,920
upload the images right so then you can

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,420
sync them in eventually we're going to

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,390
fix this and then I'm going to go back

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,740
and I'm going to go again so that's gone

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,440
you don't have to deal with that now we

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,810
can make it easy right now it's a

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,459
disaster so a lot of it is going well

00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,860
this is currently a disaster but your

00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:08,320
our fixes around it then when we get it

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:09,420
fixed here is how it actually works this

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,100
was a great job

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,120
it was a great example of doing this

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:19,240
right so here's so many people saying

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:30,010
our documentation terrible but like

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:31,420
someone because they have it all out

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,160
there and they say this is exactly what

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,950
it is and it doesn't get as bogged down

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,670
as style meds get way the logo must be

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:42,760
50 pixels that way and then a lot of

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,770
good a lot of newspapers have up their

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,250
tone of voice articles as well those are

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:54,899
all fantastic when the metro doesn't

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:56,950
have that and then just basically non

00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,300
software companies because they might

00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,360
have

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,410
playing up there and it tend to be

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,410
especially the bigger companies they

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:07,949
tend to have an entire company involved

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:11,579
around it I'd like to think some of my

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:13,050
documentation is good I'm sure everybody

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,770
can tear it apart so it's usually just

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,179
me going what am I done

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,800
okay that was awesome I can't think of

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,010
going finished today so thank you very

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,010
much

00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,549
