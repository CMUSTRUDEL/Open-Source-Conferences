Description: 
	Lightning Talk
The good, bad and the ugly of contributing to open source.
Ulrich has been contributing to open source for the last 6 years in different ways, from support to documentation to bug fixes, and organising events.
He will talk about how this has helped him but also about the challenges involved to contributing to open source.

but I would talk today about the

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,029
realities of contributing to open source

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,279
so starting off or is open source and

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:23,279
then how you go about contributing and

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:29,489
then what the realities of contributing

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,989
to open source so as you might know most

00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,090
of you that open source software is

00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,570
something that's freely available may be

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,670
redistributed and modified that gives

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,570
you the power to make changes as you

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,719
wish so with this will open source

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,250
software you mainly have four freedoms

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,230
the first is that you can use the

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,910
software it had a meaning any

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,149
restrictions you don't need to pay for

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,359
it depending even it's premium where you

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:01,140
get pay for access you're not paying to

00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,480
be able to use it another one is to be

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,780
able to redistributed if you wanted to

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,370
you can download copy of WordPress put

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,160
it in a flash drive and pass it on to

00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,070
your friend you can't do the same with

00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,490
your DVD movies you normally get allowed

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,210
to copy rip the DVD and then pass it on

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,820
to your friends another one is you can

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,400
modify it so you can modify WordPress

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,340
have a great new feature innate and then

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,570
share that with your friends too or any

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,370
other plug-in or theme and the last one

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,140
yet you know distribute is modifications

00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,380
there's multiple times where people have

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,990
a plug-in not being further developed

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,910
and someone else has taken it forward it

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,850
and continue the development of it so

00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,410
what makes orchid sauce so special you

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,680
know like minutes before it's open

00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,990
anyone can use it next thing is the

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,610
community is a community around it I

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,530
mean if you look around this room here

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,960
we're all people we enjoy using word

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,360
press open source software and we all

00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,190
can work together have great discussions

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,510
and learn from something from each other

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,030
another thing is with open source

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,570
software can be continued who you see

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,880
that was WordPress before WordPress

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,370
existed it was a different software and

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,010
then that was not being continued and

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,560
might little and Matt Mullenweg decided

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:36,640
that the needed to be a solution and

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,739
that's how they created WordPress so

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,800
there's not this is no central

00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:46,600
government or organization was managing

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,890
the software an innovation you know

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,040
different people have different ideas

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,989
they can try things out when we see with

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,050
the project of Gutenberg that's being

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,600
developed on github we can innovate and

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,720
is not affecting the core product and

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,940
then we can see you know that when it's

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,190
ready if we integrated into WordPress

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:11,709
and third lastly security in the code is

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,870
public anyone can look at the code and

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,570
if they find an issue there they can

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,900
report it and that we can be fixed very

00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,970
easily we recently had a client come to

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,410
us and said they're developed was

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,430
working in Adobe

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,840
said WordPress is not secure and we have

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,769
to disagree with them and explain to

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,769
them that so many people review

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,870
WordPress yearly and there's so many big

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:41,140
companies that use it and do regular

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:44,470
code reviews security reviews attempt to

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,110
hack it that they're a derby system

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,360
which is not public does not have the

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:55,150
same amount of security testing done on

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:58,510
it WordPress soft or the open source

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:03,090
software is free but how is it funded we

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:06,610
you got is different tools here that run

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,780
on open source software and each of them

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,709
have got a different model

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,910
you know Firefox works on donations and

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,970
sometimes

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,290
from Google for having their search

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,370
engine in the browser

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,200
you've got react that is sponsored by

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,950
Facebook you know as they use DNS their

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,130
own tune

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,080
you've got WordPress that is being used

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,640
by me or different companies who invest

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,800
their employees time into building and

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,720
improving WordPress and then you've got

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,390
something like ghost which is a

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,320
nonprofit that sells the services and

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:45,990
the SAS program to sponsor the work done

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,500
on ghost that people can use on their

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:52,800
own servers so we're just going to do a

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,780
bit of audience participation so raise

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,730
your hands so who are you who have

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:03,030
contributed to open-source before half

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:15,030
the room okay and so how many of you

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:16,820
want to contribute to open source so who

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:22,440
wants to learn where to start

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:24,980
okay that's good one day I was a

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,980
last-minute addition

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,490
so the different teams that you can

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,470
contribute to I mean today has been like

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,970
a lot of the community team we've got

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,470
like the work camp

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:39,480
we've got speakers we've got meetups and

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,460
these are all volunteer work and there's

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,300
everyone working together this is one

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,820
way of contributing back another one is

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,100
through supporting documentation in a

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,250
documenting WordPress speeches how to

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,460
use them helping users how to when

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,300
they've got issues with WordPress

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,980
another one is translations

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,500
accessibility doing testing giving

00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:09,420
feedback then we have design and testing

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,970
if you're a designer this is a way that

00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,310
you can contribute help the developers

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,530
who may not be so great and design to

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,400
come up with better UI in user

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:22,770
experience then we've got the review for

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,289
the themes on WordPress support they're

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:28,520
reviewed for insecurity

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:30,860
issues worthless TV and this videos

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,930
today will be uploaded to WordPress TV

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,169
and these need to be processed and

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,879
edited before they can be uploaded

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,699
they've also got teams that do training

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,589
and marketing too so that people

00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,770
understand what workers really does and

00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:48,409
that is useful for wide range of clients

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,930
from agencies to smaller businesses to

00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:54,439
understand why WordPress can be useful

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:58,339
for them and then some four teams are

00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:02,059
mobile and hosting who also they build

00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:04,759
the workers Commack and also see that

00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:08,149
how can we improve hosting for WordPress

00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,399
sites and then the two bigger ones which

00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,610
you might know is WordPress core itself

00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:16,639
in the code that goes into WordPress any

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,249
bug fixes and improvements Gutenberg

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,409
belongs to the core project where you

00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:25,490
can contribute and then you've got the

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:27,499
WP CLI which is the command line which

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:32,319
is joined the WordPress project last

00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:35,659
year and lost nearly lost

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,259
we've got meta that runs and improves

00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:43,059
wordpress.org itself Heather mentioned

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,059
before that there's a privacy team

00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:54,680
you'll have to choose the color yourself

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,900
with you so I promise

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,900
cartoon on internet and I thought was

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,360
quite cool so how is it you know you've

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,430
had someone pass me you know telling you

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,469
that you need to contribute to open

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,099
source and so what I know other things

00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:12,830
will be really great so you come up with

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:14,599
an idea you have a bug fix but then the

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,090
feedback you get is our maintainer

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,919
already fixed this or you come up with a

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,779
new feature and then you get the

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,840
response that's great but you need to

00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:25,580
read our style guide first on another

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,680
case you might have you want to improve

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,729
the documentation but you get the

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,860
feedback oh maybe someone else is better

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,560
at doing this or we're going to make

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,079
this change or there might be a simple

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,659
type of correction but you made the

00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:44,420
correction in the wrong place and at the

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:47,000
end you feel frustrated you want to

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,649
contribute but your contributions

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,180
weren't accepted and I've experienced

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,810
this before you know there will be

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,240
hurdles and I think what if you start

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,970
knowing that there will be hurdles you

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,800
can plan for it I mean there is a case

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,800
that we should try to reduce these

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,329
hurdles as much as possible but there's

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,750
always going to be someone who is a bit

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:15,890
negative who comes across wrong or has

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:18,769
had a bad day and has affected your your

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,350
experience of contributing and by being

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,180
aware of this situation beforehand you

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,490
can take in your stride and realize oh

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,500
maybe this is someone else I can talk to

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,019
maybe it's another way around the

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,790
solution you don't need to climb the

00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:36,880
mountain maybe you can go around the

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:39,589
mountain and contributing is for

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,110
everyone I mean this is the first

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,660
contributed a attended I'm somewhere at

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:48,620
the back this was in wordcamp europe in

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:54,350
Leiden nearly fifty five years ago now

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:57,650
and yeah it shows that anyone can

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:02,600
contribute it is not restricted to a

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:05,660
certain person but you will have

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,280
frustrations I've experienced that in

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,500
the last six years I've been

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,280
contributing you know you come up with a

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,950
cool idea

00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,380
you want to get it implemented but then

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:18,470
there's always something not working

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:22,370
this is always someone says oh maybe not

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,070
maybe we can do that bit later and it's

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,850
just working out how to deal with it and

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:30,410
maybe even taking a break you know say

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,230
it's not working now I'll come back

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,000
after a week or two weeks and then see

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,400
where it's going can I talk to someone

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,830
else is there another way around it the

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,470
big poem mercy was contributing is also

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,990
communication I mean most of us here

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,390
have any as a mother language is your

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,180
first language you can understand other

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,220
people easily but large number of other

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,020
contributors in the WordPress project

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,480
don't have English as their first

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,120
language and so that can make it

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,190
difficult to understand or they express

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,430
themselves in the way that they would

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,920
would in their first language and not

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,470
just that but we're writing together in

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,970
text you know you don't see the motion

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,730
of the person's face

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,130
I mean I've written with a few people

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,320
and then I thought they were angry or

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:24,530
irritated but when I've talked to them

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,890
later on in person I realized that was

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:31,220
not the case and so it's being aware of

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,590
that using perhaps emojis to better

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,300
express yourself to make sure that the

00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,490
other person realizes you're not

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,640
irritated and some time thinking about

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:43,340
the tone of what you're writing if you

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,670
write a mean text on snack or in any

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,670
other place

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,470
another thing is motivation you need to

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,050
work out what's your motivation for

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,500
contributing if you don't realize what

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:00,579
your motivation is it can be difficult

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,399
you shouldn't contribute just

00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:06,010
told you to I remember I started

00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,440
contributing to the Support Forums

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,279
because I was learning something there

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,490
another time

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,320
I mean for me it's been a lot just from

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,930
learning I've been helping with the team

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,550
review code automation the things that

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,480
I've learned there have been very

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,940
helpful for my daily work and so are you

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,240
doing it to make a career for yourself

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,160
are you doing it to make yourself known

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,839
are you doing it just to have a good

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,850
time to meet new people

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:40,089
and I think it's important to think

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:43,570
about this before you start contributing

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:46,930
does bring your profit but it does not

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:50,470
do it in a monetary way you're not gonna

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,800
get paid to contribute unless you work

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,950
for some companies that have you allow

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,350
you to contribute to WordPress but

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,140
there's so many other ways of profiting

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,050
from this I have been the past received

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,690
jobs offers often having contributor

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:11,949
after having a certain visibility in the

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:14,560
community you may also profit for your

00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:17,529
company inner youth build a feature you

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,350
share it out and then everyone else can

00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:22,600
profit from that and also yourself your

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,000
company can profit from these new

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,310
features that are being worked on this

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,890
new Gutenberg project we think how many

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,019
hours are going into building this new

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:35,019
feature and you get it for free in your

00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:38,290
company and so this is a way to pay you

00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:40,589
know contribute back and help everyone

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,589
else

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,730
so the things that we looked on today so

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,950
first is the freedoms of open source

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:55,120
anyone can contribute it's not produced

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:57,910
to developers or engineers of designers

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,930
even if you've got a certain skill like

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:05,830
event management to organize a word camp

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:09,310
that can be useful then working out how

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:12,060
to deal with frustration and taking that

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,650
into account you want to communicate

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,390
positively you will have a positive tone

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:20,200
you won't have a positive influence on

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,510
the community and then work out what

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,890
your motivation is why do you want to

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:31,600
contribute to an open source community

00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:34,150
and then at the end you might not see

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,190
the profit straight to wave but you can

00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,650
when you reflect back on your time in

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:43,980
contribution you can see that there is

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:46,840
some type of profit so I'd like to

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:50,250
appeal to you to support each other to

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,250
contribute to open source

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,759
