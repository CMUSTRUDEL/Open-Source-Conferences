a silly SS contest today people are

00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,580
already confused but folks it doesn't

00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,369
going to try to make comics but sympathy

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,110
and first thing the fan say hoax and

00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:19,420
filters are absolutely everywhere throw

00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,759
it out the WordPress source code this is

00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,980
just even a core and Logan's also have

00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:25,689
their own and if we didn't have them

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,369
WordPress you know we couldn't do

00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:29,410
anything with it's our it's a

00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:30,880
developer's gateway into WordPress to

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,439
make all these channel and handsome

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,110
let's say we didn't have an appointment

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:39,190
of any plugins that we do have massive

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,270
amounts of plugins to do so if you find

00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,920
a source code

00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,899
I go survival searching for things that

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,120
you actually might apply filters and

00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,250
when I see those you know those code all

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,620
their final that's an opportunity to be

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,390
to interact with that with that plugin

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,109
or with WordPress setup for your point

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,579
of time and so you know like Emerson is

00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,289
fantastic it's after that ones bees

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,000
around the place so you don't have to

00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,649
have to go on hacking those and

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,939
certainly WordPress core as a lot of

00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:11,950
them as well and I get I did a search

00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:16,240
for WordPress 495 and I found 867 to

00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:24,250
action calls and 43050 filters called

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:26,350
Hugh and one of the actions that they

00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,780
might come across we had

00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:32,299
we see a lot of having teens and so

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,729
WordPress itself adds a lot of uses that

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:40,399
particular action mm Oh totally there

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:43,789
I am so 20 and behead the examples of

00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,429
what what it's doing in those cases I am

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:47,869
so first thing to do is what's the

00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:50,539
difference between actions and filters

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,490
folks is a bad name of ingredients you

00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:55,569
know doesn't media employees but might

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,310
be you can push your way into this or

00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:00,649
into the execution of WordPress and do

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,909
something but with the actions of today

00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:04,189
and filters which are the two different

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:06,259
types that are available to code and

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,840
actually some allow you to is when you

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,269
see direction that's in your action

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,620
points and the word press is gonna see

00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:14,930
who's gonna be who wants to run at that

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,910
point of time what it's doing is you can

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,769
run your code back to that one time you

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,450
don't return any data and that's the

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:22,519
difference with others but you get to

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,040
run your code when you see applied

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,840
filters it's what it's going to do if

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,170
anyone who wants to run to call to that

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,269
point of appearance and data at that

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,000
point and they're you know through your

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:39,200
code and your your expected returns to

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,850
make a wish so the way the to give it

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,010
metaphoric and to try to help understand

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,170
this and I would describe you know

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,720
actually like a music festival so for

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,250
example the BBC biggest new things we

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,100
can is on at the moment over near to

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,900
time for today right so let's say you

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,269
decided you want to see me in charity

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,769
this afternoon what would win this with

00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,750
the music festival here you say you say

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,819
somebody kind of a unitary give me a

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,560
call which is coming onstage and you

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,230
know when you get that call these

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,360
cherry turn on it but I got a hill they

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,740
will see well as sushi way back there

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,360
and you know get all ready to show a

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:15,440
real fine you know remember all those

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,480
worries type impressions on and so is

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,740
that you know we need your code you're

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,290
going to write something like out action

00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,080
this is the actual name so you see a do

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,140
extra color on it has a that's it there

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,959
and this is the name your color and this

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,180
is the position and white befall this is

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:37,870
army number 10 when he decided is to do

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,870
a Cuban so when the from the homework

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,850
to action by name kid has a playbook

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,230
it wants to be called who wants me call

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,540
them all order you might decide I want

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,010
to be called first second third and that

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,390
becomes more of that's penny what you're

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,250
going to do but most of times people

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,780
don't threaten their tennis behind and

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,960
you know they pick ten so you can tune

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,370
over numbers and I really want 10,000

00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,470
there's no over there's no over number

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:08,560
to it

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:11,410
so okay so with Corbin Winston card the

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:22,840
two actions in WordPress I said I saw

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:24,520
there was a book like when your page is

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,320
an execute you know you make requests

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,600
always the end you know hey you

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,580
delivered the core calls a number of

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,770
plugins or actions that you know people

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,780
are typical to use you'll see things

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,100
like plugins odors which indicates all

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,350
the focus of all voters you know

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,560
absolutely to do something and after the

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,090
theme is never eroded and each one on

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,360
show that yesterday when he was very

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,640
wrong when he was showing the zombies

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,160
you do that he ought to show previous

00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,860
posts and you know where you can decide

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,320
to modify filter I want to show it a

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,690
double ups so butters there isn't one of

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,120
there's a particular codex reference and

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,890
this facing them and it gives you an

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,730
idea if you're doing something with you

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,710
know and the thing

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,960
and with your wordpress and with your

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,400
page where you want to execute for

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,750
example you have something that you'd

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,060
like the very angry do you want to do

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,090
some Titan yeah but it missed them all

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:21,550
there and there are ups you know 2010

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:25,300
more and the means with regards they're

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:27,100
all mine in certain times okay they

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,190
become quite importance especially with

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,160
the plugin loading an example of that

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,080
vessel if for example plugins and

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,790
there's a there's a database into you

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,550
which has active plugins and a list of

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,500
all alphabet I am and what WordPress

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,720
Mustafa just once and all cells always

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,880
that order now if your WooCommerce name

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,980
right down the end outfit if I plug-in

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,630
is called amazing you know advanced

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,630
WooCommerce it's going to get drilling

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,910
before we cross so if I want to do

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,830
something we promise I can't start

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,170
running WooCommerce functions until

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,200
that's you know what I have to do my

00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:04,570
code is I'll say oMG my code agreed

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,610
amount of non monotonic loading zone in

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,890
action so that won't actually get well

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,330
so that's like saying tell me when

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,800
everything's loaded and come back to me

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,900
and I'll go my code so when everything

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,180
gets loaded that WooCommerce started now

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,000
I can come back I know I'm calls and do

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,950
your stuff now so and so I'm not moving

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,230
stuff already having scenarios where but

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,370
I always a this function doesn't exist

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,590
and you know you're actually so saying

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,690
so what we deal with this later

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,730
I do it I need to see what you're doing

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,440
all your code mean when you have your

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,300
plug-in if you want to run something at

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,650
the very end you know your plugins I

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,140
should know what it's really early on

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,370
but you don't get your code all day long

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,690
that's the whole thing about actions and

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,580
more just putting it like that music

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,229
actor said you know I'm

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,539
registered registering my interest very

00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,220
early on but you know I'm not gonna get

00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:53,469
called to the most to the appropriate

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:55,509
right time and so super simple is up to

00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:58,810
what it would look like and I say even

00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,000
the college in so you do like action

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,280
this is the actual name to see my

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,319
function name I just and there for

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:12,389
example because it's an action I said it

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,389
was its you actually gets into something

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,250
code I've often said to people and if

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,030
you want you know there's only actually

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,800
my clothes not working you know you know

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,330
has a comment to something that I

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:35,770
mentioned what the page be produced but

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:38,319
these do produce or you know and I say

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,000
you know this third one is defaults

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,159
pants hidden each other but just just to

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,139
show you work I mean was any positive

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:50,560
number and the example are gone was WP

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:52,930
head and he saw it a small screen shot

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,029
from one of the core source files that

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,250
over the twenty and it's one of the

00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:59,740
coldest items with so within WordPress

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,139
core already this is the line that calls

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,419
all those guys and so what we're pressed

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,190
goes ago though and all those guys at

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:09,010
once we want this bigger point

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:13,360
so this this function here which is in

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:15,490
this is 20 trader and said actually

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,960
Billy Pugh head called this function and

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,270
that function actually pretty much just

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,700
does this particular market so when you

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:26,400
look to see you don't you know you who

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,400
view sources are working out there

00:08:26,640 --> 00:09:20,590
that's why it was such a simple example

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,390
there I so you know that what you can

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,370
also do is you know when you do another

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,950
action and also do with the organs and

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,450
running even

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,010
comes in on action say oh by the way I'm

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:35,850
going to remove something else at work

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,980
so they might say we don't want to

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,040
expose the WordPress version so what

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,260
they will do is no you answered this was

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,040
behind by this so why are you doing this

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,990
with Clark invisible because I'll see my

00:09:47,040 --> 00:10:02,100
chromite mine coal gets long before this

00:09:48,990 --> 00:10:04,829
my say hey remove the DP head I'm gonna

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,600
jump in and move just just before just

00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:09,889
jump ahead in the queue before this

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,139
other one got it birth to be run so

00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:20,190
that's where those probably do something

00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:23,070
similar you have to go that number that

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,779
you already run it's too late you know

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,510
you're gone so you have to don't jump it

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,970
before I will take that and and you can

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,040
do that anything bit of an action then

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,339
I've actually you can pretty much jump

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,560
ahead of it and remove you know so you

00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,390
can disable stuff with you know commerce

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,820
so that you know has adds a lot of stuff

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,100
without action again you can use this

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,019
it's no jumping in before the Everland

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,040
do something to take them out change

00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:52,260
their order another scenario in this we

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,899
will congressman instead if you want to

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,520
move stuff around so WooCommerce they I

00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,040
don't know what

00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,450
they changed their templates some set of

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,760
actually having everything in big

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,380
templates that were quite inflexible

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,870
that required you to an edit template

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,610
files that he moves they changed to be

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,440
in and out actions today what they would

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,480
have is like a single to action call I'm

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,010
turning on they were to say I adduction

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,230
they say oh I have the price of the

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,910
image out of Amanda the short

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,100
description oddly enough description or

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,990
a long description I mean there's all

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,060
those things i but uh and so what that

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,850
allows you to do is change things around

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,340
or removing the you society wanted the

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,170
high the title once the high priced

00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,460
software people are logged into your

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,640
site and that's what they could do if

00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:38,120
they replied if you have a template box

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,160
so for example here is my decided here

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,890
and you want to move things around and

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,990
okay so what I do is I jump in and she

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,820
also if I jump in this particular

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,980
options called before all this stuff

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,550
here so what if I do is I jump in pretty

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,710
early and then start moving stuff around

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,330
while I'm doing here this one here when

00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,250
you do a remove actually you have to

00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,140
call the interview you have to call it

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,170
exactly the same a deduction you know

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:06,020
but you just change my mood to so even

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:17,120
in WooCommerce code source code it'll

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:19,820
have actually all that what I'm actually

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,820
doing is instead of the period you know

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,130
the tenth position earlier for the price

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,570
will be very very high on the page I do

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,640
have an example my mom

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,050
and my own website Beverly just and it

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,120
very exaggerated it's not the way that's

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,100
paid to turn the whole page upside down

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,960
for doing this type of thing but I move

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,030
them all in another it's a completely

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,800
different order just to show if you

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,070
don't mean to the multiply template

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:50,810
class becomes a nightmare of a result

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:52,220
there's partly because it's a type of

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:56,090
syntax involves a locker

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,020
I am the so what I prepare it to like

00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,370
pasta pasta

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,890
hopefully everyone's familiar with that

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,870
idea party game where somebody has a

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,670
parcel and has a gift throughout the

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,140
site into multiple layers of Rocky's

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,550
paper and as it goes along and the view

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,620
that stuff child takes a piece of

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,950
wrapping paper off but then she went all

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,380
piece of paper it goes right in sir they

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,450
might not but so the type lady is where

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,150
they're being passed with your with your

00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,800
and with the other filters you your

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,900
functions given some data they're called

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,910
out the parcel and the WordPress expects

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,530
that person to come back know that

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,450
possibly you unchanged become a check

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,400
you know that you can have more updated

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,690
you can move out the paper you can

00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,130
switch it to bleed missing parts in

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:38,750
there what you do have to return

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:40,820
something back and so in essentially

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:44,960
when we have gone action call yeah I

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,420
called and it there but where is what's

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,280
Builders you might be when people might

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,050
be tossing a net number of pieces of

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,160
data to you so you know that's the

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:57,260
business accounting for that so I'll

00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,970
give an example of the content so when

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,970
you call the pumps of the content

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,560
they are very different and so let's say

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,840
what you call the content it goes calls

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,130
the content filter so that people

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,590
thought that WordPress for example to

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,410
change all the your Smiley's can get

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,520
changed you can actually it doesn't

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,640
there's a number of different things of

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,370
doors and like my paragraph tags and you

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,230
know that such thing as short clothes

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,790
are getting gone as well so if you

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,400
wanted to make some stuff for example if

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:31,550
I wanted to add to the end to make all

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,710
my posts come to the floor plan I would

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:37,940
do something I filter again it looks

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:39,620
like the action call and so this is the

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,940
actual name of the thing this is my

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,740
function because there's only one and

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:48,920
because I know position 10 you know in a

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:52,430
work has only one that rubber a default

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,500
is 10 on one so don't know what my next

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,060
I'm perceiving this bit of data that's

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,150
of what I'm home all I'm doing is just

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:02,060
taking them and returning they done in

00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:05,030
this again so gave us a very very simple

00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:09,130
way to do so that's a very simple

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:11,300
example they do sometimes get a little

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,810
bit more complicated this is where they

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,960
tend to come in so WooCommerce example

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:21,050
Clinton and but they but the other thing

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,580
is that the parties and stuff you can

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,220
decide to change it you could remove it

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,130
dies off removable points and or even

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,170
went inside

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:35,610
you know they say it's on sale this is

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:37,500
not - it's on sale so with the outfit

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,399
for you to say different now here might

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,529
differ function name when you have a to

00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,990
hearing on and on so what we're going to

00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:48,990
say it's too likely password so well it

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,880
becomes possible to you is it's possibly

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,490
in the stranger would say install and

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,139
it's passed me in the product object so

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,649
when I have this product of the exam I

00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,810
can

00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,790
this is not like check I can check the

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:04,019
price because I say but it's on sale

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:06,240
return nothing otherwise return it so

00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,920
that's again a simple way of changing

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,300
stuff I didn't have to apply a template

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,490
files those banks conditions here is

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,980
this may be changes to say hey super on

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,990
Cinnabon out already or you know it's

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,889
not set just stay with it that's why you

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:26,480
can choose to change and another one I

00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:29,370
often do I'm learning has a particular

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,630
filter I am the officer to say well I

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,959
wonder if this is the like fifth but

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:35,730
chosen for this particular both days and

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,620
you might where they often do it anyway

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,750
I check the date that's coming to me so

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,519
I for example here what I'm doing and

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,660
this goes back to it the talk this

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:49,709
morning about debugging

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:52,079
I am so I doesn't modify anything it

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,880
returns the data thought I made a point

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,680
about you know I think what David came

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,650
into it I'm running into the air at all

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,170
but hopefully it's my at debug

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,480
area and most developing the page so

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,790
therefore what I can do is I go in page

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,190
nothing has changed I can go to the

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,660
airlock and say hey you know what cuts

00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,730
what day it was past this function now

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,070
what page was and I can learn something

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,510
about it you know and if this is a very

00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,450
simple one that was been tasked with

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:21,780
life and with the WooCommerce moment

00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:24,590
fine past 80 plus you know I maybe

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,300
didn't know I don't know up spring

00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:30,750
what's there I think I should do I can

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,370
do a borrower export its second what the

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,410
day's convince me and I see well is this

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,160
going to be using or kind do I need to

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,290
use that they find something else are

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,570
and so the big question that I have is

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,860
is where does all this come from

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,720
so if you if you were to write this

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,690
small a little bit of code about where

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,730
you work and you know you might not want

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,230
to put it into your theme you know you

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,640
may only have a parents name and you say

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,970
why can't we want to find out it's not a

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,590
credit at all and you say well but I

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,900
think it's actually much easier you know

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,030
you have a talking you control into its

00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,610
function stuff PHP file but you may have

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,230
told this you want to say so I'm going

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,790
to be changing this team that's why this

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,980
particular bit of code word I don't want

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,180
it to disappear you know and no matter

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,250
what team I'm going to use my I'm gonna

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,980
have this particular feature so then you

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,420
want to put it somewhere else I would

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,270
recommend something called functional

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,610
logging and previous talk Tom said you

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:27,820
can go generate those weird video comedy

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,840
but it's very very simple one is a but

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,030
they call it that

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,670
I am I gave it to you real quick

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,800
descriptions these certainties to this

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,810
the text will appear under and under

00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,780
plugins so you know we've put in is

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,490
there I think it's also very useful that

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,140
you can when it's blowing you can

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,580
activate a deactivated especially with

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,920
something you only have temporary use

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:52,540
our very short-term use quite a few look

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,330
I am so I ain't if it's like okay how

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,830
they're gone because out of elux and

00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,590
also because that you know you can say

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,910
deactivated invited or if there was a

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,000
problem with like it's a bomb though

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,440
they were trying to if you put some code

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,720
in here let's say you have a spelling

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,670
mistake or a title in it and when you

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,930
try to activate the WordPress is going

00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,880
to trap that thing there are not

00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,710
activated at all so these two happens if

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,110
you put it into your function about PHP

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,610
you had a mistake in there you build up

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,140
the page you put your white screen you

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,330
know where is you know this one need

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,180
cause you haven't affected anyone you

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,940
know at all just go back fix it

00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:31,540
activated no to save and but so the

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,130
summary is that they say my metaphors

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,020
for our actions is like getting a line

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,250
for concert you know you're just doing

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,840
so you know you're naughty

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,820
you know you just might not when you do

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,680
your thing off the booth where your

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,060
filters I can pass the parcel you're

00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,570
actually dealing with data you have to

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,800
return the data to bonafide as well and

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,780
functional going on things are very safe

00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,700
way to hide your code that won't damage

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:55,230
anything won't get lost and updates on

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:58,230
their boss and that mean changes either

00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,230
right

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:09,289
[Applause]

00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:11,629
I really like the analogies or well my

00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:14,169
only issue with half the hospital rusty

00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:16,070
PHP developer for business merely

00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:20,299
antipasta parts where I just kind of

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:22,759
paper off so is there any like filters

00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:26,330
just to me sometimes are quite difficult

00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:30,049
it just talks in terms of understanding

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:32,120
what an applied filter in its intention

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:35,119
is doing are there any kind of tricks or

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,190
ways to slight green how to use a filter

00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,159
that you kind of come across because it

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,379
might be exactly together right yes so

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,679
just got incredibly complex in terms of

00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:45,259
heavy

00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,879
I agree some are written I mean I find

00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:48,799
it struggles for a while they where you

00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,509
see a nice filter call especially when

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,749
it's the advantage in a line of older

00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:55,669
stuff and especially this one of those

00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:56,419
triple Cola those ones that they're

00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,340
really cute

00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:01,070
the one thing I want is try to try to

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,169
remember and easy very easy to spend is

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,080
when you have it when I says if I apply

00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:07,730
filters the next parameter is the data

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,889
that's coming they won't come back to

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,409
you so you can have some of this one

00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:14,749
it's gonna miss it said I said applying

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,820
filters this video and said HTML and

00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:20,840
then thought and you know and that's

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:23,299
where you think yes I expect it was

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,309
multiple planners and that's exactly

00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,139
where you're buying me this debugging

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:30,649
things and they always experiment

00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:32,690
yourself something I always do a bar

00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:34,610
export at Howard airdog through the

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,179
Maranatha virus or of the day we see

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,980
what it was and today only one sound I

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:40,980
was going through that filter and then I

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,070
were

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,220
I might go back but this is a very safe

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,630
way always you might need to be you know

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,130
you know you're not trashing so you're

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,910
not gonna get to 5-under areas and so

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,110
forth and but yes it is especially when

00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,270
they're written if they're written on a

00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,799
single mile and I've gone you know

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,809
update that equals apply filters

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,250
something dangerous that epoxy their

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,200
positive in the Senate right but again

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,030
they're easy they're easy to understand

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,520
when it's embedded in line and that's

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:12,210
what I always built this yes I say bar

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,640
export and what's the one true yeah

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,640
cause if you do for whatever underpaid

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,100
so it's it's narrative of our export I'd

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,020
always use that it will send my data to

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,419
it it won't send you a browser extends

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,460
go arrow dog I can go look at it go oh

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,470
you know anything and especially if it's

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,110
a especially person object or it's

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:38,870
already and now you can understand what

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:38,870
part very much young everybody

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:48,330
it's very easy to thought the big kind

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:50,880
of sequential list of filter selections

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,070
and because she's a little bit sloppy I

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,830
was kind of wondering it's running

00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:01,159
performance issue Obama's resisted pump

00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:03,840
in our folks was fun and also actually

00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,309
started by adding an extra book it's

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,580
always things all that too many cook it

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:11,039
but WordPress I mean because if your

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,870
function about PHP or in a book it it's

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,100
just another bit of code there just hunt

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,899
of different names you know you might

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,909
say oh it's in my team it's in my

00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:23,250
functions of PHP my team and that's a

00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:25,440
huge you know these things are all

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,129
extremely buddy this thing they say over

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,230
the next period

00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:30,090
you know the pen where you put it but so

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,440
they don't wanna say I don't leaves any

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,809
performance benefit for having an in

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,580
your team or anatolian by everything is

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,649
easier to manage it's in Logan because

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,389
you wanted as able if you ever save it

00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:44,159
will sound one bit it sort of feels

00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:47,309
wrong I think it is a misconception in

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,590
some with somebody's justified to not

00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,840
having too many buttons I but I think

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,200
about that people are gone they're too

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,450
extreme

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,370
there are plugins were completely but if

00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,970
small the cases I think you know

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:06,570
you know what you do to manage things

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:08,610
not like I have I have folder and it's

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,620
just basically like WordPress I think I

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,820
called cyclic it's like oh I'm all these

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,670
different things for example this one

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,560
you know if your body type will tell you

00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,840
you know the pain like it doesn't tell

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,030
you the page URL and it has another few

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,330
things that might say no js' or a few

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,860
other classes there well one of the one

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,200
that have been years ago was padding the

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,050
page template into it and I think the

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,940
the URL so if you decided on it because

00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,800
where it might now and your body type

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,870
your custom type page that's twelve

00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,790
thirteen now that's what we did ideally

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,760
pages I don't everybody paid by P

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:44,040
whereas if you put into pace your

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,500
interview of your about Us page it's

00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,720
going to create a page that shows so

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,980
when you reconcile your CSS everyone

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,160
knows about me you know it's very

00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,570
logical what that means and you know set

00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,310
it to page twelve thirteen who know

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,590
who's ever remember what that is so

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,510
that's a small insight dogged by just

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:03,060
rolling it you know it's a very simple

00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,190
one-liner filter you know very shortly I

00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,800
just said into it okay that's something

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,270
I was just dropping I briefly cover

00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:14,940
those things into a client area they

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:18,270
were loads faster than using like you

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,350
know so it's really quality of your book

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:24,270
of the day of the person I have

00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:26,160
sometimes how they add a WordPress

00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,350
website they had a massive big plug-in

00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,690
and eighty modules in it they were only

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,600
using two one of the most for example

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,990
related to displaying related part of a

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,150
public page and that was you know I

00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,980
don't about had to remove

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,310
and was just removed insert or remove

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,870
action call so now there's something

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,400
sender with the other bunch of using so

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,800
just by how to make choice your lines

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,080
I know remove that whole booking so even

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,790
though the only use it to Monday not to

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,530
though with all those modules and check

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,930
I even use that you can use but all that

00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:59,750
all the motive departs so now I diffused

00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,850
so you know you can't from a couple

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,340
might have personnel and on the mm I do

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,660
it was a good to put that in there you

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,450
know otherwise they'd never figured out

00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,270
my hospital miss out like oh well it's a

00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:17,990
color figured out book and small you

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:20,480
know in case of that I think it's you've

00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,970
ended up with a huge motion pod of those

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,070
into those filters you need to start it

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,510
off from her own but that you're worried

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,190
about a huge beach would really small

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,930
bit maybe should have felt three on all

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,420
this cool there's maybe a shots about

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:34,160
you started all the wrong faces and we

00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,960
were trying to do too many things do we

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,390
actually mean all the booze things or

00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,190
the state for the basis we saw golfer

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:43,280
was well the weight or might actually

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:48,380
once we get to that book Tom to rebuild

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:52,600
all the way back yeah I know it's

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,710
questions yes gun I'd like the idea a

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,430
functional plugin that you can turn on

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,450
and off its third way of having not but

00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:04,190
you can enter

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:07,760
the code in your admin interface yeah

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:10,010
you can actually a few if not sometimes

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,260
the editor give the backend editor'

00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,390
turned off what if you were to plug in I

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,950
think Logan's I think I know what I know

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,550
that you could the interfere is all my

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,070
fault

00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,870
and if it seems you know you can

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,460
actually go it gives your doctor theme

00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,440
in it you take the fall you want and

00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,740
actually probably I don't think it is

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,850
there's another game called Coulson yeah

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,560
which basically lets you monitor in this

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,470
case of good management remove generally

00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,180
don't actually see that quite a lot

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,550
myself but I've stopped using it because

00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,140
you lose version control so like

00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,750
environment maintained and they can

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,340
tweak to something if I might if it's

00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,030
code that's sitting on my harddrive and

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,440
I've got it

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,030
committed to a git repository and I

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,040
write something I can roll back course

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,410
code snippets the plugin while it's

00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:58,010
great using yet an easier it's not

00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,960
worker gionee but that would be that

00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,160
would be these is one the way to achieve

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,170
what we're looking for it

00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,370
you know so he's just copy this from you

00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,840
know from your Facebook group something

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,250
and you just drop it in there and it

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,810
will be you know the ones activate but

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,090
again it says that it's starting to

00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:17,270
stick it made your error you might you

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:19,100
know that they don't know what often you

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,470
could go back in actually database in

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,520
RDF G's could be enough to rename okay

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,880
no yes

00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:29,430
so where is loaded wine and activators

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,290
like you know they are

00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,360
and I upload one with them staying is

00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,830
going to fly over there I mean you know

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,390
you have to have to pee and take it out

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,320
whereas it was in the database that

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,610
could be even harder

00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,650
you got to find where it is in the

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,680
database and you know group and then

00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,510
maybe it may be in a serialized where

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,680
you know where they they've taken all

00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,610
the codes names and put them in one

00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,380
database entry you know an exodus that

00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,390
could be a major mess so I don't know I

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,610
hope they stored it there about but and

00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,560
so that's why that's why you know if you

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,090
put up with a bit of code that to be and

00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,380
it is up and your font you're flying you

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,490
know you're about to get back to where

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,000
you were then you figure out what

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,070
happened

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,870
you go to your hair laws and whatever

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,940
they all this stuff from the debugging

00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,780
WordPress talk this morning figure out

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,780
what actually went wrong

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:22,200
getting all their songs a roommate let's

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,200
get big grandma thing

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,840
