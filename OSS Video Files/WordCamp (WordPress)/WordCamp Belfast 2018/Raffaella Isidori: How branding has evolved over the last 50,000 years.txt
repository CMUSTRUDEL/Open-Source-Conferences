Title: Raffaella Isidori: How branding has evolved over the last 50,000 years
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	The practice of branding can be traced back to 50.000 years ago. The concept of marketing branding to 4000 BC.
And with the (r)evolution brought forth by Internet and Social Media, today we are all brandsâ€š and as such, we all need to be aware of how a brand is best managed.
This talk is a primer on the origin and the evolution of the concept of branding, so to better understand and care for our brand(s), regardless of their being a company, a product or a personal one.
The talk will highlight key aspects of quality branding, and serve as a theoretical introduction for the workshop where I will teach the basics for building, tending and grooming a brand.

[Applause]

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,610
ha I'm not gonna say that because

00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:17,080
someone read it yesterday and I said ok

00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:21,939
I'm just gonna let it be seen but you

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,189
know hello good morning I'm going to

00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:26,110
before I get into my talk and I'm gonna

00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:27,090
be spitting because there's a lot of

00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,840
content

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:37,030
allow me two things the first thing that

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,490
I want to give a shout out are Mike

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:44,710
little and Matt Mullenweg

00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:47,890
for coming up with this idea and most of

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:51,250
all deciding to make turn this into an

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:56,380
open source project and giving us

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:59,290
something to do our blogs

00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,590
build our businesses but most of all

00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:05,229
create a community which of all the

00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:08,590
WordPress things for me was and is the

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:13,920
most valuable and the second thing that

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:16,450
I want to celebrate with you was the

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,280
results of the referendum in Ireland

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:25,120
yesterday because I think it was awesome

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,490
I spent most of Friday crying for like

00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,909
no real reason except it was everything

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:35,740
was very moving and the other reason is

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:42,460
brings me to this very special slide

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:49,119
because as a woman and as an older woman

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:52,720
in tech I am minority and Yost has a

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,270
fund to support minorities come to you

00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,250
speak and without them I wouldn't be

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:03,520
here so I'm very grateful but I also

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,790
want to speak more and more about the

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,360
need that we have for more women and

00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:14,390
more older women Tammy spoke about

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:19,430
listening I was at a

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:23,260
the event a few months ago in Milan I

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:27,650
live in Milan nearby @x enter

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,230
interactive which is you know they get

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,750
to do a lot of really big important

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:41,870
projects and the panel was five people

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:44,780
five men white and the second guy

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,680
started off saying you know we're a team

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,709
of 200 and we're like scattered in four

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,850
different cities and the average age is

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:59,930
26 and I wanted to get up and leave

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:02,300
because I was like the average age is 26

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,010
and I did some math I mean not a good

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,860
math cuz I'm a designer I'm not you know

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,440
a nerd but I kind of said so that would

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:13,250
make like the oldest people in the team

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:19,959
be 35 and you guys wanted to some design

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:24,590
things for me let alone my mom but so

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:32,890
diversity is really important that said

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:38,900
how about you how many designers okay

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:43,610
how many developers okay how many

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,590
marketers okay I'm trying I'll ask you

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:50,959
later what the other of you do

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:53,959
but anyway so our holo brands because we

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,920
are over ends today and I'm gonna try

00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:01,940
and show you how we got there meanwhile

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,640
this is me I do a lot of things I used

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,340
to be embarrassed because I grew up at a

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,660
time where if you did a lot of things

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:16,030
you were bad at all of them and if not

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:19,370
if I've discovered that no it's not true

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,890
these are the three representations and

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,289
at the end of my talk you're going to

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:28,280
they're gonna make more sense than now

00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:31,010
and I want to go over three

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,080
with you today the first thing is what a

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:38,660
brand is and what a brand is not the

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,139
second is to show you a little bit about

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,540
how the idea branding has evolved

00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:48,320
because it has taken on more and more

00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:52,220
meanings and the third is I'm gonna give

00:04:48,320 --> 00:05:01,669
you my little blueprint of how to go

00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:05,570
about branding so let's go okay and

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:08,540
usually this is there's a bike what do

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:12,700
you mean and what I mean is that a brand

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:16,520
is not a logo these are not synonyms

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,860
okay this happens all the time you hear

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,700
people referring to a logo as a brand

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:27,710
and vice versa and they're not and I'll

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:35,330
show you what I mean what is this Nike

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:40,280
right so this is my right the attitude

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:44,720
the the mission their vision their what

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:49,840
they want us to feel about that so this

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:55,669
is Nike's logo but this is Nike okay

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:59,990
it's that thing you know we usually get

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:03,410
like also you get parties it's like

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:07,280
Canon and Nikon you know Mikey and like

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:10,700
adidas it's like I like leaning here and

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,950
while leaning there another example okay

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:17,840
most of you are gonna know what this is

00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:21,140
do not say it this is a logo right

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:26,960
by all means right but it's not a brand

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:29,479
this is the brand okay this is the logo

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,690
of the New Zealand All Blacks it's a

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:35,300
symbol it's it's a design it's a visual

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,630
icon but it's not the brand

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,669
it's the representation of a set of

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:46,830
intangible values

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:49,020
that set us our company our product

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:54,150
apart from something else

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:56,900
so the brand is that set of intangible

00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:04,259
values okay that's why we talk about

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:10,979
brand equity tomorrow from hand handling

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:14,669
who borrows from zefrank and me now the

00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:17,840
brand is the emotional aftertaste I like

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:20,879
that a lot because this is what's

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,789
happening more and more you know when we

00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,439
meet a brand we almost get the same

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:29,939
feeling that we get when we meet a

00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:32,669
person you know I like you where I don't

00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:38,789
like you you annoying me right off you

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:42,449
know from the start so a logo we can

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:46,740
think of as a two-dimensional icon of a

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:49,680
multi-dimensional experience which is

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,620
the brand and I'm sure that if you look

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,080
at any one of these you get that feeling

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,539
right you get it you recognize it and it

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,990
triggers something in your mind can be

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:07,740
positive can be negative can be neutral

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:12,289
but it's something that goes beyond you

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:15,960
know the design but how did we get here

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:20,399
so the first thing the first practice of

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:28,259
branding and it started about 50,000 BC

00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:31,680
is ownership and the purpose of the

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:34,320
first branding was to recognize

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,800
someone's property from someone else's

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,930
property so there is evidence in the

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:46,350
Lascaux caves of cattle marked probably

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:52,589
with paint or tile to be distinguished

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:54,920
from others and there are addiction

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:58,320
funerals and

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,880
documentation that it that depict

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:08,330
branding in the in a more permanent way

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:15,410
which started about 2000 BC which is the

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:19,680
burning and in fact branding comes from

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:22,290
the north blender I don't know if it's

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:30,900
pronounced right but you know sorry I'm

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:34,020
forbidden which means to burn so ii need

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:40,200
solved by branding was to establish a

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:44,580
product's origin and along with the

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:49,980
origin very often who made it where it

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:57,660
was made which material and so on so we

00:09:49,980 --> 00:10:02,370
have engravings found on good from china

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:05,190
ms the Patania Greece India and it

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,000
basically also tells us that it was a

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,030
need that everyone had to somehow

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,240
identify their products and also the use

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:19,920
of their products there's a whole

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,580
conversation going on here there's a lot

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,620
of things written in there in Chinese

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:30,350
that said that gave a lot of information

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,930
about that pottery and in room

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:38,010
archaeologists have identified about

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:40,350
1,000 unique Potter's marks that were

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,380
used during the first three centuries of

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,800
the Roman Empire so we can deduct that

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:50,040
there were about a thousand Potter's in

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,510
Italy in Rome I'm sorry and they all had

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,670
their own little shop with their own

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,370
little brand and they were probably like

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,890
you know the trendy you know Potter of

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,170
the moment you know I'm going to that

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:05,060
Potter because he's he does you know

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:07,930
better things than the other and further

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,120
these are oil lamps

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,480
that were found in Modena there was a

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,730
big fabric of a factory I'm sorry of oil

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,040
ants and I know if you can see it but

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,310
they all have a little different stamp

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,310
in the background in the back in the

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,250
bottom I'm sorry

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,770
so that's forward to the Middle Ages in

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,410
the Middle Ages guilds that started

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:36,310
using marks to distinguish their work

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:39,430
from other guilds so print makers and

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:45,250
and paper makers would use watermarks

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:48,670
and stone makers and parries developed

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:56,020
this elaborate system to identify their

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:59,670
work or the origin of the stones in the

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:05,920
Renaissance artists like Michelangelo

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:10,150
started this is a detail of the area

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,300
across Mary's chest and they started

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:18,420
signing their name instead of symbols on

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:20,980
their artwork and by doing so they also

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:24,640
started introducing the concept of

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,820
authorship as opposed to and

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,190
recognizable authorship as opposed to

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:34,450
you know the artist is being someone

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:38,310
that big things and who cared also we

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,310
get the notion of brand as a reputation

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:48,700
fast-forward to the Industrial

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:51,880
Revolution and mass production equal

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:57,760
equaled a lot of products all the same

00:12:51,880 --> 00:13:00,160
so you know how are my jar is

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,850
distinguishable from your jars we're all

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:08,890
making jars but so the first thing that

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:12,220
people did was to brand put signs on the

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:17,850
containers that the goods were shipped

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:22,170
in and then they started branding the

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,360
actual packages and by the way

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,950
I always freak because they're like so

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,570
much better than the ones you know like

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,750
Campbell's soup I would love to buy

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:35,990
Campbell Soup those you know like look

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:39,269
at the mouth that we are talking late

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:45,930
1800s okay so this is like the birth of

00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:49,589
packaging and by the late 1800s

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:55,740
companies that started to invest and pay

00:13:49,589 --> 00:14:00,779
money on branding and so they demanded

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:04,589
their legislation so that their products

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:08,970
could be safeguarded so the trademarks

00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:12,600
Registration Act of 1875 did two things

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:16,170
it allowed protection so that's mine and

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:22,290
you cannot make a copy of that but it

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:26,519
also allowed a brand to become sellable

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:30,060
to become company assets and therefore

00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:33,089
the ability to give value to that

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:39,089
intangible value that I had built for my

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:40,920
product okay so we have the factories

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:45,029
and the factories are doing all these

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:50,670
nice little products but I have to

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:51,690
convince people to buy them you know cuz

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,910
they're gonna get there and they're

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:58,680
gonna go okay now there's five jars

00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:00,779
which one should I get so you had

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,589
convinced them that you know your

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,510
product was better and that's the you

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,899
know that's what advertising comes in

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:11,850
right sorry for that horrible rhyme but

00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:18,329
there was no way to escape it you know

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:24,810
every time every time anyway there was a

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:27,449
young guy named James Walter Thompson in

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:32,310
the early 1900's who actually had a

00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:35,400
vision white you know farsighted vision

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,350
and his advertising agencies was the

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,140
first one to establish a creative

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:44,490
department to create content for his

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:49,160
clients but he wants even further he

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:51,900
wrote two books the Thompson blue and

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,940
red books of advertising

00:15:51,900 --> 00:16:00,600
he wasn't like a great copywriter you

00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:05,160
know but and they were actual guides for

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:08,760
companies explaining what opportunity

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,650
opportunities advertising could give

00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,620
them so they were like actually

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:16,650
advertising for advertising kind of

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,190
things but basically he introduced the

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,770
concept of trademark trademark

00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:25,850
advertising and an early definition of

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:31,650
what today we call branding

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:34,589
so between 1920s and 1919 40s

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:37,110
we have Preet and radio advertising

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:41,910
because obviously advertising needs

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:46,170
media and their reach

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:50,040
is related to media and so at first

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:55,370
budgets were dedicated to newspapers and

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:59,790
radio spots and then that uh you know in

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:02,550
1942 we hadn't afford it between the 40s

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:05,459
and 50s at the television changed

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:09,980
everything and now I would love to see

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,980
if this can actually go

00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:23,130
America runs on bull of the time I'm

00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,470
sorry did I wake you

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:30,240
it wasn't supposed to be that loud but

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:33,390
what you've just saw was the first ever

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,960
aired commercial no no no no no we're

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:43,200
not going to see this again freak

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:46,700
so that aired in 1942 and it was you

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:53,580
know the first commercial ever aired and

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:56,040
by the late 1950s and the 60s we know

00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:00,270
all about these guys right TV

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,700
advertising is the advertising and it's

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:11,550
generally referred to as the golden era

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:14,070
of advertising so in the 40s I'm sorry

00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,080
in the you know in the 50s in the in the

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:21,000
first decade of television advertising

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,340
and in general advertising the products

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,790
basically had to say hello

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:33,090
I exist by me okay because there was not

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:36,420
a lot of competition so the idea was the

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,820
unique selling proposition in the

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,640
decades between the 50s and the 60s we

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,700
go from that to an emotional selling

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:49,080
proposition because products start to

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:52,680
become more parity so there is more

00:18:49,080 --> 00:19:00,030
toothpastes and more soaps and so I need

00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:02,940
people to any duty to get some kind of

00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:07,770
emotional attachment or emotional

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:10,170
relationship with the product so the

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,740
communication becomes more about

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:16,680
feelings about not so much there's this

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,560
product but how is this product gonna

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,600
make you feel how are you gonna be

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:27,140
better a safer more secure more cool

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:33,570
more rich looking or

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:36,140
better-looking so the point is give your

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:40,800
products a personality that they can

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:44,460
that customers can relate to between the

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,830
70s and the 80s television sets are

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:51,090
basically everywhere everyone has them

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:53,670
everyone has more than one so we see the

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:57,510
rising of mass media product branding

00:19:53,670 --> 00:20:02,000
and basically if you had a good

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:05,490
commercial and a big budget so you just

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:12,420
you know pestered people it would work

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:16,970
people would recognize you and and and I

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:21,180
couldn't recognize your product but as

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,280
media theory becomes you know as media

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:27,080
becomes more important media Theory

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,300
becomes something to be researched and

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:35,520
reflected on as in the words of Marshall

00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:39,660
McLuhan between the 80s and the 90s and

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:44,370
the 90s we see communication shift from

00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:48,120
product to producers so companies begin

00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,820
to advertise their brand more so than

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:54,530
their single product which actually

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,330
makes sense because it gives you a wider

00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:59,400
opportunity okay if I sell you a product

00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:02,850
you know the product but if I sell you

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:07,650
the producer and I establish a

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:10,200
relationship with the producer then all

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:14,190
the other products that I made you know

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:22,230
bring to the market start with an

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:27,060
advantage so look if television was a

00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:30,740
game-changer internet was like the total

00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:40,140
revolution between nineteen in the

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:46,370
between 1990 and 2010 we see everything

00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:53,570
change Amazon is was founded in 1995

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,570
Google in 97 were pressed in 2003

00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:03,300
Facebook in 2004 and all these guys

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:07,890
totally changed the way we communicate

00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,930
and for brands this had two major

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:14,040
implication and has two major

00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:19,080
implications the first one is that there

00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:22,740
is nowhere to hide and we all have

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,490
examples you know of you know big bread

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:29,880
blunders like American Airline dragging

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:34,200
or United actually dragging a passenger

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,450
out of the airplane or I don't know

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,970
there's so many at this point that you

00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,870
know brands have to be very careful

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:47,520
because whatever blunders you know a

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:50,580
brand whatever failed whatever mistakes

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:55,550
a brand can make the world is watching

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:59,850
the world is recording and it just

00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:03,420
happens instantaneously so guard needs

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:07,520
to be kept up the second thing is that

00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:11,610
we all have become brands

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:22,250
that's because through social media we

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:29,240
now all can become VIPs but we can also

00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:32,400
be attacked and judged and bullied and

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:37,110
scrutinized and that's something that

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,600
used to be only you know VIPs I mean you

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:43,260
know it was like paparazzi's had no

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,680
interest in general people now the risk

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,980
is that I mean I have a little story

00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:53,240
that happened in Italy but that's

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:58,550
applicable I'm sure

00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:05,270
the in every country there was this like

00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:07,340
in inside contest in a bank and and bank

00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:11,000
directors were asked to make these

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,550
little videos you know to with with all

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,590
their employees like singing a little

00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:19,850
song and whatever and one of these

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:22,880
videos was leaked out and the pool I

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,970
mean the whole the whole thing was

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,290
pathetic but like and the whole idea was

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:34,210
pathetic but this woman who was in the

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:38,090
video was the video you know made to

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:39,980
reached Facebook and by within a few

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:43,040
hours she was like the butt of the joke

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:47,090
of the entire country and it was

00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,030
horrible you know her kids were like

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,800
picked on at school she had to close her

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:55,610
Facebook account I mean it was really

00:24:51,800 --> 00:25:05,660
really horrible and she's like you know

00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:07,760
he's no one me you any one of us so but

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:12,320
you know the good part is that we can

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,990
all be influences if you when I was

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:22,220
young a kid wanted to be a soccer player

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:24,500
and a girl like a ballerina okay now I

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,680
think you ask any kid they want to be

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,550
they want to be rich doing videos on

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:35,530
YouTube something like that right so

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:37,880
gotta fit on these she's now I think 31

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:44,290

00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:53,420

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:15,440
okay she deserves it when I was doing

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:21,220
research for this I found out that this

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:08,800
what you want to be an influencer okay

00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:12,470
so branding has evolved right from

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:15,170
defining ownership to defining the

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:18,620
origin and quality of something to

00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:21,590
identify that project to differentiate

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:26,900
that project from a product I'm sorry

00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:31,970
from something like it to become the

00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:36,400
company asset so sellable to be a status

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:39,530
symbol okay how many people do you know

00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:47,210
that are just so you know I have that

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:52,510
watch I have that car today your brand

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:56,450
is your cap promise to your customer or

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:59,240
to put it in the words of death basis is

00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,980
what other people say about you when

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,500
you're not

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:13,750
in the room okay which is reputation

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:16,540
basically okay so this is all cool right

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,740
people big companies with big budgets

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:27,220
with you know advertising agencies you

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:32,679
know what about us you know what can we

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:35,380
do should we build or manage or work we

00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:42,059
tend to our personal or business brand

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:45,250
and how and the answer is obviously yes

00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:51,070
to the first question and how I'm gonna

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:53,380
show you this of course is my you know

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:58,330
blueprint that's how I go about it

00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:04,210
it applies to any size of brand because

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:07,540
it's just the logical process so the

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:10,840
first thing that you need to know is who

00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:15,520
are you what do you do if you're a

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,740
product what do you do it's very hard to

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,280
sell something that it's if it's not

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:24,100
really really clear in your mind and if

00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:28,900
we talk personal brand this is actually

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:31,809
not as easy to do as if you do it for a

00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:34,570
product because personal brand is that

00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:39,370
you know like Who am I who do I want to

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:42,490
be and you know identifying that is not

00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:46,660
easy but is very important it's point

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:49,960
number one point number two is who are

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,450
you talking to your target right if you

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,440
don't know your target every

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:59,440
communication you do could be right

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:05,650
could be wrong could be somewhere in the

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:10,990
middle you know your market okay so you

00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:13,710
and your target are in a market you know

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,710
who else is there

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:20,170
how do you make you know how are you

00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,020
different from the rest and how what

00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:26,500
makes you valuable or different than

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:29,890
everything else and to know to answer

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:33,250
number three you need to know who the

00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:39,220
others are because otherwise it's a bit

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:42,310
hard you need to have a clear vision

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:47,320
aware of where you want to go and if you

00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:50,590
don't you need to get one because it's

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,640
like going on a road trip I mean you may

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:57,730
not really have you know the exact spot

00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,010
location but north-south-east-west you

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,740
know more or less that's what I want to

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:10,300
achieve if you don't have that clear is

00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:13,420
very hard to communicate that remember

00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:16,180
that bit about you know people have

00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,910
smartphones and they can like tape you

00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,450
doing really bad things and tweet about

00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:28,840
it in no time

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:31,120
values are important today and you're

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,500
going to be held by those by those

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:38,800
values even if you're a pizza place you

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:43,300
know if you say my PC is the cheapest

00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:48,010
that it has to be if it's super good

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:52,270
than it has to be if it's vegan it has

00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:54,580
to be okay if it's organic people should

00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,250
not be thinking you know I'm gonna be

00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,490
organic you know cuz that's not good

00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:02,950
there's another pizza place you gotta

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:06,160
have a plan you know I'm so glad to see

00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:10,290
that this morning you know other

00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:13,090
speakers spoke about having a strategy

00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:15,670
for a long time at least for me maybe

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:18,550
maybe it's just me having a strategy was

00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,890
kind of sneaky you know like if you had

00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:24,970
a strategy you had some kind of agenda

00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:27,250
you know and so always like you know it

00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,950
felt kind of weird but it's not you got

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:34,870
have a strategy again you're doing a you

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:37,990
know you want to go to London fine your

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:41,590
strategy is how am I gonna go to London

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:44,650
I'm gonna walk that I mean you could you

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:47,530
know you could but you gotta know it

00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,390
okay or are you gonna like bike too

00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:52,330
under you're gonna take an airplane to

00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:55,660
London and when and how much time do you

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:58,870
have and and what's the purpose okay so

00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:02,760
all these things you need to go into a

00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:08,340
strategy so that your actions are not

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:09,490
random this is the mind for it random

00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,810
okay

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:18,280
it is only now that we talk logos up

00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:24,640
until now there's no mention of logo of

00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:27,640
design of you know colors none okay

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,280
no is I have a plan I know what I know

00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,970
who I am I know who you are I know where

00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:38,260
we're going I got my strategy worked out

00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:42,280
so now I can start convey my personality

00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,950
and I can do and I can do this through

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:49,210
graphic design yeah you know we can call

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:51,580
the designer or we can call our nephew

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:55,780
in high school whatever you know it's an

00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,820
option the key here for branding

00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:01,840
purposes is consistency

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:04,780
okay you can't change your logos every

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,000
six months it doesn't work you can't

00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,639
change your colors every six months it

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,220
doesn't work you know it's it's a visual

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,929
code and people need to be able to

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,970
recognize you

00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:19,780
otherwise it's like you're resetting the

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:22,710
whole thing every time the second is the

00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:27,010
tone of voice and the type of language

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:30,550
again target if I'm selling skateboards

00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:35,860
to teenagers I'm going to speak to them

00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:40,920
in a certain way if I sell earring aids

00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:43,500
to senior citizens good

00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:46,890
in a different way probably loudly in

00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,800
the second case you know so and again

00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:55,500
you have to be coherent you know you

00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:58,400
can't be super funky in your image but

00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:03,240
then you speak like you know a lawyer

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:08,760
you know all of this has to be coherent

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:13,290
and makes sense then you need to think

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,960
about your communication you know wait

00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:19,050
how what are the better channels okay

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,350
and again it has to do with who's your

00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,510
target okay if you're talking if you're

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:27,270
selling earring aids to senior citizens

00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:30,650
you're probably going to opt for certain

00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:35,640
places to put your communication in

00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:39,450
probably not snapchat probably not

00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:42,540
Twitter as well you know and and vice

00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,880
versa and the key here is competence

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:48,120
because this is not something that you

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,090
just know so when you get to this stage

00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:59,220
you might want to ask someone for

00:35:51,090 --> 00:36:03,360
professional help and then whatever

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:09,150
you're selling you have a customer and

00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:12,450
your customer has an opinion about how

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:16,940
you treat them and if you don't treat

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:19,680
them nice they ain't gonna be happy and

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:23,250
it used to be they would just go home

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,380
and say to their five friends I am NOT

00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:29,490
ever going to buy that

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:32,250
you know bread that bakery but now they

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:35,880
may be influencers then they get to

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:43,860
Twitter and they tweet to their 247

00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:47,370
million followers that Bakery sucks okay

00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:51,360
we go back to the original recipe point

00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:54,690
number nine don't skimp I mean it's you

00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,390
know so you don't have a huge

00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:00,300
budget that's fine but you got to put

00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:04,440
some effort and love and and think that

00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:07,260
this is not gonna be a cost zero even if

00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,630
it's just your time you know writing

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,300
your blog post or posting to Facebook

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:16,220
we're tending your Facebook page or

00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,220
whatever it ain't gonna happen by itself

00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:25,349
it's also not gonna happen all by itself

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:29,040
if you're at the beach so you gotta work

00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:32,400
on it you got a stay consistent you got

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,920
a check check often make sure that you

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,450
haven't you know steered away from your

00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,310
original path and this you don't have to

00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,369
do but it's really nice and it looks

00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:47,550
better if you do you know being mindful

00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:50,670
listening to as you know Tommy was

00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:55,859
saying before you know paying attention

00:37:50,670 --> 00:38:01,230
you're in whatever context with your

00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:03,540
customer with your clients so you know

00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:09,510
you could ignore them but it's probably

00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:12,470
not gonna work out very well now if all

00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:15,349
of this applies to your personal brand

00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:21,349
steps one through seven are the same

00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:23,940
rules 9 through 11 are the same 0.8

00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,319
personality if you're working on your

00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:31,230
personal brand

00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:36,540
it has your personality okay maybe you

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:38,190
curb it a little you know but it's it it

00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:44,220
has to be true for you

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:47,369
okay if you are super funky yeah and you

00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:51,050
know shoot them or so they shut up kind

00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:55,859
of people colorful and friendly and then

00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:57,990
reflect that it's or vice versa you feel

00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:59,250
like very serious and introvert I mean

00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,560
you're not gonna have like a website

00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:04,050
that it's all blank and has nothing in

00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,900
it but you don't have to pretend you're

00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,220
like super friendly I love everybody you

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,640
can

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:14,150
just be yourself just like your nicest

00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:20,359
possible self so all this is to say that

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:23,000
a brand is not a logo but your brand is

00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:28,390
organic it's it's an organic living

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:35,570
breathing being that can be you know

00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:38,480
nurtured made to grow or it can also be

00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:43,190
made to die a horrible death if you

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,359
don't treat it really nice so you have
