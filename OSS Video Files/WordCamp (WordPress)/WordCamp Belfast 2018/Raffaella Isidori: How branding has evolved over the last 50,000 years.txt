Description: 
	The practice of branding can be traced back to 50.000 years ago. The concept of marketing branding to 4000 BC.
And with the (r)evolution brought forth by Internet and Social Media, today we are all brandsâ€š and as such, we all need to be aware of how a brand is best managed.
This talk is a primer on the origin and the evolution of the concept of branding, so to better understand and care for our brand(s), regardless of their being a company, a product or a personal one.
The talk will highlight key aspects of quality branding, and serve as a theoretical introduction for the workshop where I will teach the basics for building, tending and grooming a brand.
