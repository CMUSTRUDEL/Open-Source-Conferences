Title: Corey Maass: Stuck in a Rut - How I Overcame Six Months Without Progress
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	In January 2017, I set 5 big business goals for the year. By May, I accomplished 3 of them… And then everything ground to a halt.
I didn’t move forward for six months as I battled depression, doubt, jealousy, imposter syndrome, shiny object syndrome, not-invented-here syndrome, and so much more.
You’ll hear about how I was finally able to identify what was stopping me, move past it, and what I’ve done to prevent a lot of this ever happening again. I hope you can learn from my mistakes!

so hello my name is cory moss i and do

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,870
live and do and do indeed live near New

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,020
York City these days came over to visit

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,230
you wonderful people and after a few

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:25,320
days in Manchester I've had a great time

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:27,390
Belfast is great so first and foremost I

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,570
want to say that I am NOT a psychologist

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,960
this is a standard disclaimer right

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:37,110
there are as it is still technically may

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,730
it is mental health month which is great

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,000
there's a lot of attention being drawn

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,240
to the trials and tribulations that a

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,310
lot of people will go through and our

00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:53,550
industry whatever our industry is I

00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:56,700
guess is not to be disclosed oh I

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,620
encourage all of you to you know take

00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,980
this not necessarily what I'm gonna say

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,259
but you know take this stuff seriously

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,050
mental health your own health is very

00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:11,909
important so so with that going forward

00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,240
as she said I've been doing this for web

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,340
building websites for about twenty years

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,190
had been specifically focused on

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,210
WordPress for about eight my main

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:26,670
product is called Kanban from those of

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,650
you going what the heck is Kanban the if

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,350
you're familiar with Trello Trello is an

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,150
example of a Kanban board and if you

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,900
don't know what Trello is come talk to

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,640
me afterwards so what I wanted to talk

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,280
about is like I said there's a lot of

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,030
attention being drawn to some of the

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,740
bigger issues depression and physical

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,869
problems and especially where a lot of

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,439
us work remotely their issues with

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,030
isolation that kind of thing and well I

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,259
find obviously that stuff is very

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,950
important for me I went through a real

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,189
hard time last year but I didn't for me

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,439
I didn't feel like I warranted you know

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,669
the the diagnosis if you will of

00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,980
depression it wasn't that deep I was

00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,960
still doing fine happy with my dogs and

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,450
my wife and that kind of

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,320
and a friend of mine said you know but

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,300
you've still been going through

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,910
something and and so I kind of wanted to

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,240
share that story with you just to draw

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,480
attention to it doesn't have to be the

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,390
darkest days for there still to be a

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,860
need for community and and getting some

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,360
help so in 2017 it was actually the

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,220
first year I've been working on Kanban

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,130
for over a year and it was the first

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,070
year that I was a responsible business

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,510
owner and sat down and wrote out the

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,220
goals for the year I'd never done that

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,310
before usually I'd just flown by the

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,310
seat of my pants and for better or worse

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,530
I accomplished them by May so that kind

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,390
of left me going okay so now what do I

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,040
do and I felt actually really good about

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,510
myself I thought you know I'd gotten a

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,400
lot done so I decided to look at okay so

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,200
then what would be the next thing right

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,940
and suddenly I'm back into my old

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,180
patterns of flying by the seat of my

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:20,190
pants and the next thing that I'd had in

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,630
mind was to rewrite my my plugin so

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,770
here's where I'll introduce sort of the

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,090
first there's going to be there's gonna

00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,890
be some take aways here there's going to

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,510
be little lessons that I've learned

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,860
hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:36,600
but lesson number one don't go off the

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:39,090
rails so think long and hard if you find

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,790
yourself the type of person anyway who

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,000
does make a plan the moment you suddenly

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,560
sort of step sideways take a hard look

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,320
at that and I realize that

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,960
self-awareness is is very difficult and

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,090
I'll address that in a minute with some

00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,780
possible solutions but anyway so lesson

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,520
number one try not to go off the rails

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,130
the next thing was I said okay I'm

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,170
looking at this product and I really

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,830
think that I need to rewrite it from

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:11,060
scratch and for those developers in the

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,710
room you'll understand lesson number two

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,540
which is conventional wisdom in

00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,910
development as you do not ever write

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,530
something from scratch because you're

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,710
reintroducing all of the bugs you're

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,120
reintroducing all the problems and it's

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,210
a hard decision I still think it's the

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,889
right one but lesson number two here

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,440
basically if if conventional if there is

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:37,560
conventional wisdom if a lot of you know

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,120
smarter older people than you have sort

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,930
of laid down the law and said things

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:48,599
like rewrite your app from scratch

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:52,620
question it so that led me to thinking

00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:54,419
hard about okay so what what technology

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,840
is should I use and and last year if

00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,349
you're a nerd like me and or a WordPress

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,840
nerd

00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,220
going even deeper like I am you know

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,930
that there was this great debate about

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,639
what should be sort of the next frame

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,130
work that gets JavaScript framework that

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,319
gets introduced into WordPress and there

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,860
was a lot of discussion around

00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,139
should it be react should it be view and

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,030
I was already looking at some of the

00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,680
issues that had led me to wanting to do

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:24,030
this rewrite would basically be solved

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,430
built it with with the built-in

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,630
technology of something like react so I

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:33,360
was already looking at react but it led

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,070
me to you know this great internal

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,219
struggle this great internal debate of

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:42,449
like well a couple of things one is

00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:45,229
there is this syndrome called shiny

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:49,259
object syndrome if you're not familiar

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,669
the joy is inevitably you're working in

00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,229
the way that you know how to work and

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,849
there's always a new framework there's

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,729
always a new technology there's always a

00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,289
new app and it's always more exciting

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:01,310
than whatever you're working on grass is

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:03,389
always greener kind of thing so

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,210
thankfully at least in this case I'm

00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,620
looking at this and I'm going react at

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,630
this point is being adopted by the

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,849
WordPress community as being debated

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,789
highly as being used by smarter better

00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:16,380
developers than I am that I think this

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:20,819
is the right decision but again it leads

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:24,870
to it leads to a lot of insecurities the

00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:26,759
other thing is that I am a developer for

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,909
20 years I started this when there

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:33,360
weren't frameworks right and so I'm just

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:36,900
used to building a lot of things from

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,400
scratch for myself it also leads to a

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,219
deeper understanding right but that's

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,820
that's this thing called not invented

00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,840
here sin

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:48,210
which is any many developers suffer from

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,330
well I didn't write it so in of it so

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,680
it's undoubtedly inferior because I'm

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,880
smarter than everybody in the room

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,870
generally not true but so I start to

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,040
sort of end up in this mental cycle of

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,110
what I think this is the right

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,900
technology but is this the right

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,000
technology I didn't write it the other

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,250
thing that that started to happen was I

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,830
said okay well I don't know react at all

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,280
and I'm basically under pressure to

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,840
rewrite my product using this new

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,380
technology which means that when I

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,070
finally ship a product ship you know

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:29,220
that that it has react built in it's got

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:32,990
to be great it's got to work right and

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,400
so I don't have a lot of time to ramp up

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,030
which inevitably leads to yet another

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,950
syndrome that is common to our community

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,710
which is called impostor syndrome right

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:47,520
where basically it's a nice nice way to

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:50,490
say insecurity we all feel like we

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,230
aren't adequate that we don't know in

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,750
fact as much as we do because honestly

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,530
we are constantly bombarded with and

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:01,410
this isn't necessarily a bad thing but

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:03,420
experts who clearly come across you know

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,030
teaching us new things and whatnot and

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,880
so leaves you going well I don't I don't

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:13,920
know as much as this guy or gal you know

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:17,280
am I good enough so just to put a cap on

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,350
the first half of this story basically

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,020
wow I'm sitting there kind of learning

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,790
react kind of insecure about whether I

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,620
should build react kind of insecure

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,480
about well if I build it and react is

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,690
this going to actually do what I needed

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,960
to do and and and all that kind of stuff

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,610
I of course basically stopped working on

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,970
the product because I don't want to keep

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,180
developing it if I'm going to rewrite it

00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:44,610
so that starts to introduce feelings of

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,930
depression and anxiety while I should be

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,370
doing these other things but I'm not

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,520
doing these other things where are my

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:55,050
priorities I'm also watching other

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,000
businesses succeed you know everybody

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,640
vlogs about how great they're doing and

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,980
you go to a meet-up and and you talk to

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,660
people and and how how's your company

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,040
doing on we're killing it it's the best

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,730
year ever because what else are they

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,200
going to say right but so now I'm

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,420
starting to get a little jealous and

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,649
basically all these emotions are just

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,360
running through my head running through

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:18,440
my head and this is where I basically

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,610
just froze in place for a few months

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,250
where I just couldn't get out of my what

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,910
my own way I couldn't I couldn't decide

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,519
nothing quite felt right so I'll pause

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,760
there I'll leave you that's that's where

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:37,230
boy loses girl right or developer loses

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:40,800
Wi-Fi password or whatever it is so what

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,660
I thankfully at that point you know I I

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,100
could pick my head up and there were at

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,540
least a few things that I had done right

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,920
because I have been doing this for a

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,430
long time one is I have been working

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,730
alone for a year and a half and realized

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,720
that I needed help

00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,110
specifically with marketing but also

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,520
just a sounding board so I've basically

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,380
am now collaborating with Jake who's

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,270
sitting there I'm calling him out the

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,660
other handsome gentleman in the Kanban

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,279
shirt but having somebody else any other

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,230
voice and this doesn't have to be a

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,600
co-worker colleague it could be a friend

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,459
it could be a loved one just having

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,990
somebody who's willing to listen makes

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:24,950
all the difference I'd also just

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:27,930
previously joined there's a an online

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,300
community called post status which is

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,360
kind of meant for people focused on

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,100
business in the context of WordPress but

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,529
there are there are WordPress forums

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,089
there are Facebook groups and again it

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:40,649
doesn't have to be WordPress that just

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,410
happens to be the world that I revolve

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,329
in but again having these people and

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,890
watching these conversations go by and

00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,860
seeing that at least once in a while I

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,660
wasn't the only one chiming in and

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,490
saying hey I'm having a hard day or I'm

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,730
not sure about you know this technical

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,529
decision or that kind of thing the other

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,110
thing that came out of those communities

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:03,680
was I started what's called or joined

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,730
what's called a mastermind group and

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,680
really really handy I encourage

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,510
everybody to start one you know

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,610
and easy basically you find a few

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,670
like-minded individuals kind of pursuing

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:19,029
the same goals in life and business and

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,470
do a once a week call and there there's

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:22,210
you know I won't go into this but

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,800
there's lots of different ways to run it

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,300
the simplest one just being each of you

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,700
take 15 minutes to kind of talk about

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,040
the problems that you're having and

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,200
everybody helps brainstorm solutions and

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,760
then there's a nice element of

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,980
accountability what are you gonna do by

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,560
next week and then the next week you say

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:44,260
I did it or I didn't and your group very

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,730
nicely says why or why not but it helps

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,250
keep you moving forward and it helps

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,959
it's again just voice of reason or one

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,640
of my favorite phrases sanity check

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,970
right kind of to just make sure you're

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,310
on the right track the other thing is I

00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:01,000
see a therapist and I'm willing to admit

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,420
it just somebody that I talked to once a

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,490
week sometimes we talk about you know

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,510
personal problems or my frustration with

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,920
my dogs or you know road rage when I

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,600
yell at somebody because they cut me off

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,450
sometimes I talk about business my

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,100
career all that kind of stuff and this

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,420
doesn't have to be a lay down on the bed

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,790
and tell me about your mother kind of

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,500
thing but a weekly check in again with

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,180
an objective voice somebody who is

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,959
literally paid to be honest with you

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,959
makes all the difference

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,170
the last thing no not the last thing the

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,490
next thing during this whole process

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,010
something was wrong and this is where

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,830
again I'll say self-awareness is really

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,450
really tough but again having voices

00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,820
coming in from the outside that can

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,560
sometimes enable your self-awareness or

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,029
be yourself awareness which makes no

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,700
sense at all but hopefully you

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,380
understand the point I'm trying to make

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,089
my gut just told me that there's

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,790
something about this process is wrong

00:12:55,089 --> 00:13:00,339
that I dug a hole and it and it wasn't

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,520
the right place to be so I kept

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:05,230
questioning the other thing is I'm a bit

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,029
of a Productivity nerd and I've I've

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,149
tried to develop pretty good habits over

00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:12,250
time and so understanding the power of

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:15,209
something as simple as making a list and

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,760
going okay sorry what was that again oh

00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:22,610
I'm done

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:23,899
oh shoot okay fast-forwarded well that's

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,540
most of the good stuff anyway these are

00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:29,750
the solutions mastermind group lots of

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,209
peers people around you so the the punch

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,250
line or the inverted punch line to this

00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:36,440
story is basically in my mastermind

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,899
group I had a gentleman tell me you know

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,420
why are you using react and I had a

00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:44,810
canned answer that I'd told everybody

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:47,089
over and over again but dumb luck the

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,769
plumber rang my doorbell hit that at

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:50,360
that moment and I had to go let him in

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:54,440
to fix my hot-water heater that was

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:57,709
flooding my basement and he said and so

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,570
I didn't get a chance to give my my

00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,699
standard answer so I walked around for

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,399
the rest of the day going why react I

00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:06,139
react and basically it came down to wait

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,880
no this isn't the right answer and I was

00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:10,040
kind of able to walk back through all of

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,930
these decisions that I had made and all

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,440
these syndromes that I had experienced

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:17,029
and said you know this isn't the right

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,839
decision and suddenly a lot of other

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:22,130
things started to make sense so a couple

00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,300
of other quick things that I'll leave

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:28,010
you with is is constantly you know spend

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,930
a little time every week looking at your

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,740
priorities you know stay at the ten

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,930
thousand foot level and also look at

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,959
ways to to reframe your thinking ask

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,459
your friends or loved ones or you know

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,100
your mastermind group to sort of say

00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:45,440
things back to you and see if it makes

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,079
sense and see if if they can say it in a

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,970
way and with a straight face so that you

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,720
in fact know that it is the right thing

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:56,540
so the good the good news at the end of

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,569
all this is i'm solidly halfway through

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,910
rewriting it exactly the way i know and

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:04,330
feeling much better about my day today

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,089
thank you very much

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,089
