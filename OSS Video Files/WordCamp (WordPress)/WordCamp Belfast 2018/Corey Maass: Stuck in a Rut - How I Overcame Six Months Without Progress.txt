Description: 
	In January 2017, I set 5 big business goals for the year. By May, I accomplished 3 of them… And then everything ground to a halt.
I didn’t move forward for six months as I battled depression, doubt, jealousy, imposter syndrome, shiny object syndrome, not-invented-here syndrome, and so much more.
You’ll hear about how I was finally able to identify what was stopping me, move past it, and what I’ve done to prevent a lot of this ever happening again. I hope you can learn from my mistakes!
