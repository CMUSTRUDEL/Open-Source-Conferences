and he has said that this isn't going to

00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,980
be a tech talk anything with that the

00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,410
purpose of this talk is basically the

00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,469
Sheree how simple it was for secured our

00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,900
website on busy maybe even inspire you

00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:19,630
guys as well and a bit of background of

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,220
me I don't know any code basically like

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,830
I think if you talk to me if I colored I

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,710
would be lost very very quickly

00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,230
so it was really important for us to try

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,240
and find a platform that would help us

00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,420
create a website in a really simple way

00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,489
and on as I said like I work in TV and

00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,100
films like I have an automation degree I

00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:40,809
can do website experience whatsoever so

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,090
it was really important to us to find a

00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,219
platform on WordPress was our platform

00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,489
and now we've accidentally be doing it

00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:49,899
since October um me and a friend all our

00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:53,230
conversations are pretty much about the

00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,969
latest movies latest TV shows and I

00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,230
don't know a lot about his life but I

00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:58,840
can tell you this favorite Marvel

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,690
character and but all our conversations

00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,670
pretty much standard in received hover

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,110
and website which the Overland Park asks

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,570
the general guide thing of we see

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,880
totally open our own bar well this is

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,820
what we wanted to do so yeah we just

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,650
took the plunge and created it and now

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,040
with WordPress like we use wordpress.com

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,900
and with wordpress.com it has loads of

00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,840
themes which is really helpful free ones

00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,820
aren't paid ones and I'm not a great

00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,400
drawer but I had an idea in my head what

00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,979
the website was meant to look like so I

00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,280
drew up an amazing drawing of what it

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:34,659
was going to be like but obviously any

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,310
of you guys would be happier the client

00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,060
give you that because it's a detailed

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,909
and not true and so yeah basically we

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,229
wanted all our latest content to be on

00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,119
the homepage we wanted to feature

00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:50,049
section where the latest articles will

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,780
just flip through and yeah when we went

00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:55,600
to go find themes I find it really

00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,219
difficult because obviously it all just

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,890
fits dummy content when you're testing a

00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:02,049
thing so I would recommend that you get

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,939
a couple of posts create your logo get

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,469
everything on WordPress and then when

00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,119
you're testing things you'll be able to

00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,440
see exactly what you let site's not look

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,550
like because if you look completely

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,320
different from dummy

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,150
tests they're like your actual footage

00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:18,890
so when we find one that we look like

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,659
that was a website and basically when we

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,250
got a website I thought customizing your

00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:23,720
life site that's when the coding begins

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,099
that's when I'm going to be on Google

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,290
more than I'm gonna be on the website

00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:30,200
trying to find out how to do things that

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,049
sort of thing but with wordpress.com you

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,450
have a great customized options so we

00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:38,030
have the teaser fonts field she's the

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,010
site identity the menus fully able to

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,890
have like split it up into sections so

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,799
we have movies TV games that sort of

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,750
thing and and then we have the like I

00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,099
said we wanted a featured section so we

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,720
really able to create that and create a

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,150
home page that wasn't just a static one

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,959
that was hard all of our latest posts on

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,900
it had our Lea's content idea that was

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,730
pretty much what it's like so then we

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,920
were creating a blog post again that's

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,530
my thought this is where you need to

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,709
create unity ERL that sort of thing but

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,349
with wordpress.com was cannot be simpler

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:14,269
just click write a post and then you

00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:16,579
have all these customizable options with

00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:19,160
it so you obviously like your content

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:20,810
select a featured image and then you

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,579
have the options down the side you're

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,950
able to choose the category the tags in

00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:27,620
it so for instance for this one who

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,510
talked to be Evander's Marvel MCU

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,450
infinity or that sort of thing for

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,040
people on WordPress to find it and a

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,349
great feature as well which for us was

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,660
to be able to connect to your social

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,489
media so we have twitter via Facebook

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,949
YouTube on Instagram and through

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,209
WordPress we are able to select whether

00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:45,859
this will go on Twitter when it's

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,139
publish we able to write the social

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,060
media message include all the hearts

00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,069
tags everything and then once I hit

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,449
publish it'll go on WordPress they'll go

00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,549
on our website and then I'll go to

00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:57,919
Twitter I feel important free like a

00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,480
full-time job this is a simple side

00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,250
project for me just purely out of

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,959
passion for phones that sort of thing

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,609
so that sort of thing was really

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,799
important for me just to be able to have

00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,109
all these time-saving options for us

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:17,049
where we build to do things just by the

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:19,959
quicker it basically and so another

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,759
Jerome was the analytics which is even

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,470
more importance like for us it's

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,710
important to see what articles are

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,909
trending what articles aren't like

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,889
honestly able to see how many visitors

00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:32,080
are on our website to be able to see

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,610
what they visit and more importantly

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,460
you're able to see where they visited

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,110
from so if we put a 50 post up we put it

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,879
Twitter post up but if someone clicks up

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,960
what bless will tell us where they came

00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,430
from so for instance saying we put its

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,800
where they post up and no one's collect

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,569
on the Twitter post the wording of that

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,580
the half size of that something might

00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,860
not be right so it's important for us to

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,050
realize this go back to Twitter on our

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,849
social media message and repost art in a

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,479
way that people will actually want to

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:03,759
click up and and then again finding the

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,800
articles as well for instance if an

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,870
article is trending on where it's

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,780
getting a lot of traffic we can put that

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,430
in our featured section on vice versa if

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,930
something about featured section hasn't

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,400
been visited in a couple days it's

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,930
important for us to take that up because

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,349
we need to have our more important

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,180
articles right up from the center so

00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:24,310
like this sort of analytics is really

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,110
key in social media on like all of our

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,310
traffic is going to come from our social

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,520
media because we're also just so we

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,620
start up so it's really important for us

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,690
to know what's trending like what the

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,360
latest movies are I'm basically to have

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:42,159
all that latest content that is

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,319
important for us so yeah I mean this was

00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:47,139
just a bit of a life we've talked like I

00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,550
think everyone here has an idea in their

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,620
head of a website that they want to

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,120
create they may have had like figures

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,550
about years ago they may I just come up

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,050
with it on yield delay on it you're

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,479
hesitating on it that sort of thing

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,090
but you should just do it like item

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,860
divided code um I thought I was able to

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,150
create a website you guys do know how to

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,250
code you should make it way better

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,500
please form a clear idea way better and

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,770
as I said we only started this seven

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,139
months ago we have around 500 followers

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,580
or across social media which isn't good

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,190
but it's good for what we're doing at

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,440
the minute and we actually get media

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,509
screenings now for Northern Ireland so

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,180
we get there to the movies for free

00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,710
basically and usually before the movies

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,300
are even right so we can review them and

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,930
get sort of build hype that sort of

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,150
thing we were invited to the tubular

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,890
premiered on in Dublin has media on the

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,510
red carpet and unfortunately won't be

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,460
able to go because our full-time jobs

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,800
that sort of thing which was a big crowd

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,900
but I was so good that we were able to

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,330
go and we interviewed the

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,040
cinematographer for Justice League which

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,250
gathers over two thousand views on our

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,190
websites in a day noxee trans as well

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,290
because something he said was picked up

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,390
by other people and the website that I

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,280
go through normally we're citing us as a

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,170
source so that was a really cool thing

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,030
for me and we also know that

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,860
competitions as well alongside movie

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,200
heist where we give away tickets for the

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,210
cinema to see movies we just run a

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,700
competition with gamerfest and Limerick

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,550
and which is all next week which we're

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:20,140
also going to purely on media passes as

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,990
well and we're in the process of moving

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,870
from Hamburg as I'm sure you guys know

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,330
like it is a lot more customizable calm

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,970
does have its limits but for us to set

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,820
up it was a great platform for us to use

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,970
I'm moving the org but I've learned a

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,210
lot today from what the other talks have

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,220
said so it's gonna be interesting

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:46,300
definitely win the door thought it

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,850
should hopefully be good but the main

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,520
reason for talking basically is

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,320
hopefully to just inspire you guys seem

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,810
like you might beat websites on a

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,090
day-to-day basis for the cons but make a

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,240
website for yourselves like use my heart

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,370

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,930
like how many movie review websites

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,450
other like that really like there's

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,750
loads but if you're positive about a

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,610
certain subject and you enjoy doing it

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,130

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,990

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,070
