Title: Marissa Goldsmith: More than a Plug-in - My Journey to becoming a Passionate Accessibility Advo...
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	I had my first brush with accessibility in 2002. My boss was in a panic that our web application was not accessible, and that we would lose government funding.
Since that experience, I’ve found myself arguing for more accessibility in web design and development. More often than not, I lose that argument.
My professional activism on the topic has caused others to label me an expert on the topic. But I don’t consider myself a practitioner. I am a vocal and heartfelt advocate.
This talk will intertwine the history of web accessibility with my own personal story of how I evolved in my views on accessibility.
I will also discuss the role the open source community has to play, for an accessible web.

a little word can't Belfast

00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:15,530
blue as introduced I am actually a

00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,750
digital analytics I live just outside of

00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:21,050
Washington DC and beautiful Northern

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,980
Virginia and I am a freelancer but

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,390
that's not what I'm gonna talk about

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,019
today but if anyone wants to talk about

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,419
Google Analytics anything or Google Apps

00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:32,270
Script in spreadsheets or plugins I'm

00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:33,500
good to go for that afterwards but today

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,780
we're gonna talk a little bit about

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,489
accessibility so the ones though I'm not

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,289
gonna tell anyone how old I am I'm just

00:00:37,489 --> 00:01:01,730
gonna start talking about how I became

00:00:39,289 --> 00:01:04,610
how I became involved with the web you

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,140
know so what you would be seeing here

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:10,310
would be a picture from the movie

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:14,120
Independence Day which was what came out

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,890
when I was assigned to do my first web

00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,090
site I went to the University at the

00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,710
George Washington University in

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:23,690
Washington DC and that year they started

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,130
letting departments start making their

00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,450
own websites and I was a work-study

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:34,250
student in the Women's Studies

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:35,780
department and so I was so what happened

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,570
was I was I was a student at the Women's

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,640
Studies department and they asked me to

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,770
build their website however the only

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,040
classes that were available were HTML

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,860
for professors so I was 19 years old and

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:54,140
I was registered as dr. Cynthia Harrison

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:56,360
for a HTML class by the way dr. Cynthia

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,100
Harrison is the United States foremost

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:04,430
expert on the constitutional status of

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:07,280
women and so I would go and I I would go

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,140
and I would talk and I would learn to

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,150
make learned HTML and I made their

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,550
website so by the way this is how

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,960
Heather made me put this in this is

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,880
everything I knew about Belfast before

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,150
two days ago I'm a

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,340
van Morrison fan I also like The

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,490
Cranberries my kids like The Cranberries

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,960
also and I am probably perhaps the only

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:33,350
American who knows that difference

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:36,610
between Belfast and Belgrade now let's

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:41,690
see so is it gonna do this every time

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,980
well this is the slide with very good

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,290
this one I don't know why that didn't

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,510
like that slide so anyway this is how I

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,340
made the first website this is a web

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,690
editor called picot or picot I'm not

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,760
sure how you're supposed to pronounce it

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,300
and that was how I would browse it it

00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,590
was in links and that was how I learned

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,260
how to write for the web so I moved on I

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,630
was a Russian major in school and I

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,300
wound up working for an educational

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,550
organization that put language lessons

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,130
online specifically in the Russian

00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,930
language but other languages as well and

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,240
then one day I'm sitting in my office

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,400
and my boss comes into the office and

00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,220
she says these words exactly our site

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,250
may need to be section 508 compliant fix

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,290
it right now this was a lot of online

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:32,450
learning system that we had developed on

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:34,520
our own ad hoc so for those of you who

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:38,810
don't know it's section 508 is it's part

00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:42,230
of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act from and

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,210
what it says is that federal websites

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,960
must be accessible to people with

00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,060
disabilities

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,720
it's just federal websites it's not

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,890
anything else but it might depending on

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,690
your interpretation and what you're

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,880
doing apply to websites that we see

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,850
federal funding and some of our websites

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,530
did receive federal funding so at this

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,420
point I go about learning about the law

00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:07,400
I learn I go about learning about how

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:11,450
everything is and then I walk into my

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,060
boss's office forlorn sad eyes down we

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,640
have a really big problem

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:22,100
this website is nowhere near section 508

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:25,100
compliant and that's what she said to me

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,360
after that oh you were still doing that

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,770
I by the way I spent about a good two

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,990
weeks figuring this out

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,830
we don't actually this doesn't apply to

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,120
us because apply the

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,820
website we're working on we don't put

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,900
the federal funds towards that website

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:40,040
we don't really need to be compliant

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,650
it's legal enough now my mom is a

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,180
special education teacher my dad is a

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,270
civil rights attorney in the United

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,650
States I was born I was raised by two

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:55,430
certified hippies and this absolutely

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,990
broke my heart because I was I was

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,430
raised with the sense of inclusiveness

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,830
and he was something that I had been

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,720
working on for two or three years and I

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,730
spent two weeks going over it realizing

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,840
that it was not inclusive if you were

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:11,120
blind if you were dyslexic if you had

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,010
mobility issues you could not use this

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,470
website I mean hands down it was useless

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:20,120
it wasn't for to you and so I did what I

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,530
could every once in a while I was able

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,290
to convince the people to do a few

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,820
things we changed it so that like red

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,020
and green didn't mean right and wrong

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,730
all the time or there was some other

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,570
signifier but I really didn't get to do

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:36,260
much so I could eventually leave that

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:39,290
job and I wound up working at a digital

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,180
agency and that digital agency I made

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,180
sure that I was the advocate for

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,620
accessibility the web name listserv

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,110
which I by the way I'm still on to this

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,100
day and it is listserv without the e

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,570
because they use the software and to

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,980
treat it like a discipline that it was

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,420
something separate it was something that

00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,240
was important and that you needed to

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,700
know and whenever I learned I would take

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,610
it and insert it into my work whenever

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,220
and wherever I could so here was at this

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,490
digital agency and they referred to me

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,710
as their accessibility experts because

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,630
of the work that I had done prior that

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,430
two weeks sitting in a hole realizing

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,280
that my website was not accessible you

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,950
know I like feeling like an expert about

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,540
something it makes me feel good but at

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,360
the same time there were people whose

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,160
whole job was accessibility and I sort

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,930
of felt a little bit like an impostor as

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,700
they would parade me out in front of

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:36,640
their clients as their accessibility

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:38,750
expert but I would do what I could and I

00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,880
was a funk I was what they called a

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,350
functional consultant has anyone else

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,050
been a functional consultant in their

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,810
job I don't know if that's a very okay

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,420
the way I tried to discreet describe it

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,550
as I'm the middle technologist like I'm

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,230
not a designer I don't but I could go

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,130
into Photoshop and fix the buttons and

00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,170
change the colors I'm not an engineer I

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,090
don't make themes but if you needed a

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,400
tweak to the theme I'm not so afraid of

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,110
PHP that I couldn't figure it out

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,120
and do a lot of work with JavaScript as

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,280
well so that's about where I was there

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,440
but mostly I did usability QA analytics

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,930
wire framing that sort of middle around

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,000
I did a lot of CMS configuration and I

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:25,310
would take what I would learn and insert

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,320
it wherever I could so again I would

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,530
evangelize the accessibility to anyone

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,270
who would listen but if it wasn't a

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,770
priority I would slip in the background

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,560
I didn't really have the guts at the

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,310
time to to say no we're not gonna do it

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,990
this way to do an accessibility often

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:47,660
got pushed to the side in the name of

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:50,000
good design in ten years I was at that

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,370
agency I might say I had one client who

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,460
really cared but like really cared about

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:58,640
accessibility enough that it became part

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:03,250
of the process and who would let us make

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,750
decisions against design in favor

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,280
luckily we had a lot of engineer

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,380
engineer who was really passionate about

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,940
accessibility too so if you were to

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,580
allens talk yesterday where he talked

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,770
about process our problem was never the

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,510
process in the beginning we started out

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,000
with a really solid code base and people

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,440
who really cared our process was towards

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,270
our process problems were towards the

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,730
end as the client or other people would

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,840
start tossing things at us saying you

00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,030
know that is actually not the right

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,440
shade of blue we need it to be this blue

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,390
I had a client who we made this really

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,190
tiny gray little font and it had to be

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,780
that font that was their branding font

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,660
and that was their branding color and it

00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:44,480
could be nothing else and so a lot of

00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,520
these down the road decisions hampered a

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,630
lot of my efforts and then I had one

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,140
time a client who would this is a client

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,600
that was looking in developing countries

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,880
on disability issues

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,670
so this is a disability nonprofit

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,350
working in developing countries when I

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,720
told them that their donation form had

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,389
some serious accessibility problems that

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:13,130
well those are our clients they're not

00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:16,130
our donors coincidentally I quit that

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,600
job about a few weeks later but it was

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,829
it was really heartbreaking to hear

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,949
something like that so there was a lot

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:27,860
of compromise we'd make a lot of token

00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:29,149
decisions in favor of accessibility and

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,500
then just would sort of drop we could

00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,389
say we had done our jobs and we had

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,339
picked the right color scheme or you

00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:36,440
know the right font but not really test

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,509
anything else we've never had any budget

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,269
any time to spend on doing any sort of

00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:43,790
testing to make sure that the sites

00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,610
would pass we had no QA he didn't know

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,829
QA for accessibility we did it once for

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,259
a site that had federal funding and even

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:52,430
then when it failed we didn't fix

00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:58,759
because we're told it was not the right

00:09:52,430 --> 00:10:00,740
color scheme so the years go by and I

00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:04,490
keep working and I had my first child in

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:08,029
2009 again I feel like I have these

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,279
little successes and I do keep making

00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,569
compromises so I have a baby and I get

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,069
into this group like I was you know I'm

00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:16,220
a working mom and I'm killing it and

00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:21,550
it's all going great in 2011 I became

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,550
pregnant again and this is what happened

00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:28,639
my daughter was born two months early

00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:30,260
very suddenly no preparation one day I

00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:35,560
just woke up in the morning and I was in

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:37,850
labor and an hour later she was born and

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,519
within six months we figured found out

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,959
she needed glasses my favorite thing is

00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,519
when you take a six month old out with

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,579
glasses and they say are you did you

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,740
really need those or they they're just

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,180
there for fashion we press that once or

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,220
twice and they of course my favorite

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,319
joke is uh you know how did you know she

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,519
needed glasses and my husband would say

00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,519
cuz she couldn't read the eye chart

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:04,850
but those were the six months she had

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,430
vision problems and then at ten months

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,440
she wasn't developing at a regular pace

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,990
and so they did an MRI and they found

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,840
some brain damage from birth and she was

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,520
diagnosed with cerebral palsy cerebral

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,750
palsy for those of you who aren't aware

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,940
of it it's it's got a large spectrum on

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,590
the disability scale and no one really

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,910
could tell us what it was gonna mean we

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:30,560
didn't really know but over time you

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,320
know things would happen this is a

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,660
picture of her we went to Hyde Park

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,490
which is Franklin Roosevelt's home and I

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,800
got her a quotable Eleanor Roosevelt

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,210
book she's one of my heroes that was

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,710
good and it was a board book so she

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,830
could tear it apart it really wouldn't

00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:48,020
matter this is what it means her muscles

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:51,050
are extremely tight what we call it

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,570
 I say if you did a thousand

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,630
lunges right now that's what her legs

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,220
feel like every day so she's going to

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,830
use a wheelchair probably the rest of

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,680
her life at age three she had a first

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,740
seizure and develop epilepsy she has

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,420
what we call cortical visual impairment

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,940
that means there's really nothing wrong

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:14,570
with her eyes what is wrong is the way

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:16,250
her eyes communicate with her brain she

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,390
takes a lot of medications and those

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,640
medicate I don't know if this is a

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,310
proper slang they make her loopy is that

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,810
okay you know she takes medicines that

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,970
make her tired she takes medicines that

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,220
make her hyper she you know and it's all

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,790
in between they control the tightness of

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,550
her muscles and her epilepsy she has

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,620
fine motor difficulties she stomachaches

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,810
all the time her GI tract is not what it

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,690
should be and she's recently been

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,580
diagnosed with ADHD she has a really

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,620
hard time paying attention in school we

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,510
don't know if that's because of how her

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,700
brain works or if it's because of all

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,200
the medicines that she takes we're not

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,940
really sure but we just need to she

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,750
can't stop taking medicine so it's a

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,580
diagnosis we have to deal with so what

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,160
this means as accessibility is no longer

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,530
some abstract concept that I care about

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,960
because I was raised by hippies it's now

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,010
something that I care about because it

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,500
impacts my daughter this is a picture

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,899
early intervention program so once she

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,850
was diagnosed the state is supposed to

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,380
help give us it's supposed to give us

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,709
help I supposed to give us therapies in

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,139
all sorts and in June they just ran out

00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:23,519
of money and they didn't stop giving him

00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,170
and say this is our little protest

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,230
though an organization had us all take

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,570
pictures of our children with signs to

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,579
fund the shortfall and so now this

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,170
advocacy isn't just about doing right

00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:37,680
but it's about doing right by my child

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,899
that's great

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,310
but this is a word press conference and

00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,139
you're right this is a word press

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,660
conference it's a technology conference

00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,360
but it's not a software conference right

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,130
this is a community and it's a very

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,829
inclusive community and so I want to

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,839
make sure that everyone in the community

00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:58,350
understands how accessibility can impact

00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,399
the individual and I think this is the

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,860
right place to do it I'm probably

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:06,449
preaching to the choir here but I'm

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:12,060
gonna keep going I'm not going to show

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:13,589
any of these videos but when I but when

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,170
I hand out the slides I'd like you to

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:17,610
see them I talk so it's technology is

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,980
transforming the way people with

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,959
disabilities can interact with the world

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,600
today um if you would Alan's talking

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,079
today you could see the use of a screen

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,570
reader but here are some other examples

00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:33,600
about a child with autism who was

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:36,870
nonverbal who turned out to be like a

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,880
literary genius like he has you know and

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,490
he could talk and he can use the iPad to

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,959
give himself a voice the one in the

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,209
middle of the child using eye base

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,750
technology isn't to talk and to surf the

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:50,699
web the one on the right is a child who

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,260
uses switches now switches can be on

00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:55,199
anywhere they're these we call them

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,120
jellybeans she can use her head to turn

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,610
her wheelchair she can use their head to

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,170
hit those buttons and surf the web and I

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,880
have seen a lot of people who can use

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,779
that switch technology to do some pretty

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,010
advanced stuff using four switches so I

00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:11,160
want to talk about the three different

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:14,329
kinds of disabilities that we look for

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,670
so we have the visual disability

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:19,500
physical impairment and then cognitive

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,790
disabilities that we all should be

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,790
thinking about and design

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:30,900
so this is my daughter again she's not

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,340
blind but she has problems with her

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:37,050
fields of vision she has problems with

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:39,090
really crowded spaces image text over

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,730
images it might as well not even be

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,860
there and so her a special education

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,570
teacher spent a really long time trying

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,700
to figure out what combination they

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,200
could use to teach her to read and I

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,320
don't know if everyone can see that but

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:55,020
the answer is Comic Sans at 80 bold at

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,230
28-point cunning didn't have any

00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,220
designers into them how many people

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,750
would have liked to have designed

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:06,480
something in Comic Sans at 28-point and

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,560
so it's not going to look nice and it's

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,270
not going to look pretty but that's

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,470
actually what a lot of people really do

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:14,880
need to learn to read to be able to

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,300
comprehend you talked about yesterday

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,920
about the open the dyslexia font there

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,950
are a lot of people who with dyslexia

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,480
for whom Comic Sans is easier to read

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,080
than whatever font you're gonna put out

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,150
before them and so it's really important

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,580
when you're designing to not just design

00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,140
for visual disabilities that are going

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,480
to be read by a screen reader but all

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,310
kinds of visual disabilities well you're

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,740
not crowding the field where your colors

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,540
have high contrast when they have

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,880
sufficient spacing and sufficient

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,530
kerning I'm gonna show a picture of a

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,370
website I don't think it exists anymore

00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:52,710
and this was found on a website I found

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,170
this website on a website called the

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,640
best parallax design sites so someone

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,850
put this down is one of the best sites

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,589
now I I don't know if anyone here makes

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,000
or has a parallax site and so I'm going

00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:06,630
to apologize in advance

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,459
I don't like parallax sites at all but

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,980
parallax sites can literally make

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,449
someone sick there's there's some

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,480
interesting articles out there about

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:17,430
people with vertigo and similar

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,130
illnesses where when the motion of the

00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,810
site goes it's really making them ill so

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,829
we start with parallax sites being a

00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,180
problem in and of themselves it's it's

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,820
you can tell it was done by a print

00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:32,100
designer very light gray little light

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,730
gray icons on the sides with no words

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,440
associated with

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,510
and all sorts of parts I don't know

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,120
where to click nothing visually tells me

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:47,540
where to go and this was on the top 10

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:49,850
best design sites and so and it is

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,130
pretty and if you go to the contact us

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,660
page there's no late but like the form

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,010
fields or the labels are in the form

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,810
fields but there's certainly no coding

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:02,180
around it to tell you where it goes all

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:03,530
just visual now I know I actually pulled

00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,570
this up and I know we've been having

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:10,720
internet difficulties so I don't know if

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:14,510
it's gonna play so this is my daughter

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,450
playing a popular American game I'll

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,820
connect for and she was probably 5 years

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,110
old at the time and if you had told me

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,300
she would be able to do this at all I

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,470
wouldn't have believed you but you can

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:32,990
see that she has some fine motor

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:37,450
problems with her hands there she is

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,450
talking to and you'll see why

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:45,620
so that's her plane connected forward so

00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,120
Heather told me to go big or go home

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,620
here so the next thing I'm going to show

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,570
you that's it that could be an issue

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,120
with physical disabilities this is the

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,000
website of the EU which checks off every

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,410
box for accessibility it's supposed to

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,340
be fine it's supposed to be perfect

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,720
right I'm gonna show you an example so

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,780
now my daughter has not needed to browse

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,880
the website and you just yet but what

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,440
we're trying to teach you how to use the

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,350
how to use the internet how to use a

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:19,510
computer and how to use a mouse some of

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:19,510
the problems she has it's gonna go now

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,260
you by topic and when I put my mouse

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,180
over here the name is slow you saw that

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,600
flash really big just a second ago

00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:38,500
you're gonna get a big big list of all

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,500
the topics cuz I'm on it now

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:46,539
that's another time yep so well here's

00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,950
what I'll say so there was a big big

00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,720
topic here now what we have taught her

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,070
to do visually she could see it

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,750
something like that she'd be able to see

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,190
it and she'd be able to find it but then

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,659
she's gonna have this really big list

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,700
and she's not gonna be able to hit the

00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:02,259
target with the mouse so what I would

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:05,860
tell her to do is this but here what

00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:07,659
just happened everything's gone the menu

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,210
that she was just on is completely gone

00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:13,570
it's in a different place and now if I

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:15,490
click on this menu that drop-down menu

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,590
is completely gone and those options

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,049
aren't even there anymore and so not

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,190
only has her physical disability stop

00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:23,590
there but she also has some cognitive

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,509
issues and it could be quite jarring and

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,940
it is for me personally quite jarring

00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:29,559
when I sometimes I have bad eyesight and

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,200
I'll make a sight bigger and it suddenly

00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:36,279
goes into its responsive mode which is

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,889
entirely different experience and then

00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,179
she goes to this EU by topic and I you

00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,710
can't see it from what happened before

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,080
but it's actually organ this page is

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,059
actually organized differently than the

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,710
drop-down menu and so the thing that she

00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,720
was looking for now is much harder to

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,320
find and this is a website like I said

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,549
that checks all the boxes but it can

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,940
still be difficult for someone with

00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:00,490
disabilities the example I had before

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,039
this was actually my County I guess it's

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,679
the equivalent of a council website or

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,360
like our County website was absolutely

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,740
unusable for people with disabilities

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,539
which by the way our County website

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:24,490
included the office for people with

00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:26,289
disabilities she also has cognitive

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,720
disabilities as mentioned but she has

00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:30,909
epilepsy I call this as everyone

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,960
familiar with Pat Benatar this is the

00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:36,370
post EEG Pat Benatar hair an EEG is when

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,990
they when they try to scan your

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,940
brainwaves and so they have to stick all

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,669
of these little electrodes on your hair

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,559
with this really sticky glue but they

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,600
don't give you anything to take it off

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,980
when you is a hospital so she left the

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,980
hospital looking just like that

00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm gonna open this website this is the

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,020
website that was open when you walked in

00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,210
and I tried to tell you figure out where

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,330
that annoying noise was coming from this

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,670
is a website called PBS KIDS I'm not

00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:06,890
familiar with what PBS is PBS is the

00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,110
public broadcasting station in the

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:12,320
United States and they are renowned in

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:14,660
the US for children's television Sesame

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,610
Street although Sesame Street is now

00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:21,830
owned by HBO and the thing is is like I

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,390
have done this presentation twice I have

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,160
reviewed it before I came here twice and

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,480
I can always guarantee you that this

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,200
site is gonna annoy the crap out of

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,670
anyone who goes to it and it pains me

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,670
because I love PBS

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,870
so it didn't start now but it's gonna

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,100
make noise I turned off the sound but

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,880
the first thing it does is it starts

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,910
making noise that's gonna be very loud

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,230
it starts making noise it's not showing

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,850
up here but something big and bright and

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,760
flashy is going to come up in this tuck

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:02,010
spot

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,830
everything moves everything moves it's

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:08,640
supposed to auto move the text aside

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:11,460
it's like this and if you want to go to

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,660
a show you've got to find a picture of

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,000
the person you want while it's spinning

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,640
around like this could you imagine a

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,820
six-year-old in general being able to

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,710
find anything on here much less someone

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,870
with a few cognitive disabilities for

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,940
whom focus and concentration is really

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,050
difficult and like I said in a second or

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:33,810
two of the site load you're going to

00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:35,610
start hearing noises and it's really

00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,090
frustrating and then I'm not going to

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,410
load it cuz it's gonna be really slow

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:44,130
but oh this will start moving and

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:46,800
changing but if you go to the website if

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,890
you go to the page for all the shows it

00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,560
loads a thumbnail for 200 rows and it

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,030
just schools and if you're on a slow

00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,330
connection they'll never see anything

00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,010
and there's no alt text and so it takes

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:03,660
a really long time and it makes me

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:05,820
really sad because kids their app is not

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,110
as terrible and so that's what I'm

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,940
thinking is that they put all their

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:18,000
development time into the app and not on

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:19,950
the website so this is the most adorable

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,790
child you've ever seen

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,200
and when you have kids you ask yourself

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,690
like what can I could be you know you

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,600
see your kids doing things and you're

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,340
like okay my kid could be a chef well my

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,350
child can do this about or something

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,850
else you know and far be it for me to

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,920
push her into the family business

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,350
but you know I'd like the idea that my

00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,230
child could you know do tech not work in

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:45,840
technology one day or be a chef or be an

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:49,230
author or be whatever she wants and it's

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,920
really hard to see that with the

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:54,040
technology that's around right now and

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,160
so it's important to

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,260
of us to create not only front ends that

00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,800
are accessible but back ends that are

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,840
accessible also and so you can also stop

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,430
accepting the excuses that I accepted

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,110
when I was at an agency people with XYZ

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,880
disability aren't even in our target

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,760
audience why should we even design for

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,350
them if a person is blind deaf whatever

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,030
they're already used to things being

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,120
messed up so ours doesn't have to be

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,680
okay and the work that we're doing is

00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,420
too important we can't miss the deadline

00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,680
we can't do the accessibility stuff now

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,600
at the end these aren't okay and the

00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,220
other thing I'd like to say is that and

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,400
I think you brought this up yesterday

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:39,520
and things you do for accessibility are

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,410
good for everyone but he fakes everyone

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,720
say if I do it for accessibility it is

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:50,110
good for everyone and it's not just the

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,240
web I mean think about curb cutouts and

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,920
think about closed captioning how much

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,980
of how many of us sit on sit on them

00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,090
that I allowed on the Metro or sitting

00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,530
at work and you're using closed

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,330
captioning because we don't want our

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,580
boss to hear what video we're watching

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,710
everyone uses it there's a really

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,920
popular show in the States called The

00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:11,050
Daily Show and one day I read an article

00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:15,630
that said I always wondered how they

00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:17,740
found all of these obscure clips of like

00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,390
congressmen doing really stupid things

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,970
on the floor of Congress because it's

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,260
really long and drawn-out they actually

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,210
use the closed kappa they use this

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,350
closed captioning search software they

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,290
got all the text from the closed

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,330
captioning and then they could search it

00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:33,280
so think about all the joy all of us

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:38,200
Americans had because closed captioning

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,760
was required so I also think it's very

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,240
important to think beyond blindness a

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,160
lot of designers and a lot of developers

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,840
you know develop code so that it passes

00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,200
through screen readers but it's more

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,910
than that and conduct overseas or

00:26:50,200 --> 00:27:00,280
testings in all my 10 years at the

00:26:51,910 --> 00:27:01,990
agency and learn about all the assistive

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,270
technologies going we go look at those

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,370
videos about how people use things I

00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,299
mean those are three examples there are

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,789
foot Mouse's

00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:11,619
there are switches there are two

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:12,909
switches there are three switches there

00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,769
are people who can do seven switch you

00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:17,830
know it's if there's a big variety in

00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:21,340
the ways that people can now browse the

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:24,759
web graciously accept feedback and

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,940
criticism chances are there's something

00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,619
inaccessible this presentation right now

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,909
and I will accept if you tell me I will

00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:32,529
accept it I had a friend who told me

00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:35,830
what was inaccessible about it was I put

00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,940
it in Google's people's lives which is

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,529
true and I probably should have

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,470
downloaded it into PowerPoint given what

00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:43,179
happened today

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:46,539
don't the expression I use that don't

00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:47,950
able splain to someone that you know

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,590
this site is accessible and they're the

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,179
ones using it incorrectly there are a

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,100
lot of disabilities and even the same

00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:57,279
disability manifests differently in lots

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,019
of people and three disabled browser

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,570
customizations it's harder and harder to

00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:03,879
do now but like the right people who

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,139
disabled right-click it's just don't do

00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:06,519
things like that don't make it so that

00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:08,769
my daughter can't look at your website

00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,639
and Comic Sans she wants to look at it

00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:15,190
in Comic Sans

00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:16,480
it's her god-given right and test

00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,749
everything in the WordPress community

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,700
test your themes test your plugins and

00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:24,309
and as much as you can test them not

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,889
only for front-end accessibility but

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:29,559
back-end as well WordPress is probably

00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:31,710
the most accessible CMS they've ever

00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,710
seen

00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:36,940
