Title: David Hoy: Who needs PHP?
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	For years I held myself back thinking that because I couldn’t comprehend PHP there was a limit to how far I could go as a developer.
With WordPress and plugins like Toolset this is absolutely untrue. There is no data management problem I cannot solve with these two powerful platforms working together.
In this workshop , I want to demonstrate how quickly a front end form can be created and then how the data captured can be manipulated to create awesome solutions for our clients.
Any of the new form builders can be used, but Toolset is my go to as the support is unreal. To date I’ve built recruitment platforms, tourist portals, an entire HR Suite and much more using Toolset.
For WordPress users this knowledge could be very useful, for WordPress Developers this knowledge opens the door to lots of repeat business from their existing client base.

[Applause]

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,980
okay so that would be a lot more

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,779
impressive if the last guy under these

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,070
winter s and I reckoned he was going to

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,869
be really doesn't have to break his up

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,199
but it wasn't he was really interesting

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:32,670
however what has JMA gods do with

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,860
wordpress so monks drums have skin and a

00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,110
shell and that skin is attached to the

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:44,399
shell with like nails or something

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:49,199
a most drums drums together so that's

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:52,440
why you see a drum kit on stage vision a

00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:55,460
little - drums so at some point in the

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,260
manganese Empire insects 20 years ago a

00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,359
blacksmith saw this problem and said to

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,670
the drummer I'm going to keep your drum

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,040
really tight if we're gonna weld up some

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,570
metal rings and put them around and then

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
we'll attach the metal right into the

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,920
drama not so great

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,960
and it came to worked but then a week

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,780
came along and said I know where you can

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,680
shoot those drums so the one over there

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,780
spikes BC and this one over here

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,400
nice and high so the Weaver rather than

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,530
his nice what we call the valley weave

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,990
and that's allows us to chew the djembe

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,020
what does this got to do with WordPress

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,450
there was a creative he wasn't caring

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,500
about joinery or carpentry he just

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,360
wanted to make some music

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,280
so he got a bit of wood and they hold a

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,740
tie he's online and that allowed

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,570
him to make some music that is somebody

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,640
else in this community with a completely

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,110
different skill set the blacksmith he

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,210
came along and he know that his

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,070
technology taught the musician had

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,520
already gone and things got a little bit

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,290
better

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,360
and then somebody else in the community

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,820
with a completely different skill set

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,070
came along and other than his weed and

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,260
all of a sudden the music got really

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,680
good and that's what this has to do with

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,920
WordPress WordPress is not a blog

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,399
platform it is not a piece of software

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,459
WordPress is

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,040
you know all of us we all everyday may

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:17,200
pick out we bet better even if it's only

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,239
by visiting a wordpress website or

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,250
logging into a WordPress website

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,989
we're all part of the community and the

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,849
bedroom is stronger by community gets

00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:27,370
the more resources to win to that

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,319
community to make it very stronger so

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,360
the point on WordPress s was same time

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,980
and time again today dominates the

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:39,760
Internet as the platform of choice for

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:44,440
people to use what I want to talk about

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,420
today can everybody hear me okay what I

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,209
wanted to operate today is not so much

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,280
the technical solutions and the

00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,079
Pensacola and the shortcuts that we use

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,519
and I use an awful lot of my day-to-day

00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,920
work and I'll show you the output of

00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,530
some of them what I want to talk about

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,129
is how we as members of this community

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,590
can use our skills to create really

00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:09,099
functional websites websites but really

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,959
dramatically impact our clients most of

00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:13,419
my work is to do with small to medium

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,609
businesses small businesses do you only

00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,989
need a website but that's about it

00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:18,160
we don't really even think too much

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,010
about what they're going to use that

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,840
website for and I come along I sorta

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,639
listen to them talk simulator marketing

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,799
plans and realize that the best thing

00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,810
for these people to do is to tell their

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,109
brand story as strongly as possible

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,790
using their website and websites that's

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:36,849
what they're for but it's not always

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,160
that easy to debug for example a builder

00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:42,069
he's on site he's just made a beautiful

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,280
house he moves to with - phone and say

00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:46,959
Ketchum picture citroen picture really

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,180
interesting feature in the ceiling

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,310
picture and although ducks for his blog

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,470
he doesn't have to login to the website

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,260
and then we'll navigate the page and if

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,760
I do now to take over

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,400
future damage he said Bella Terry

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,739
spelled advices because he doesn't to do

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,840
but something into this doesn't mean he

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,970
shouldn't have a functional website

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,040
that's telling his Brian story

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,720
it's just my fault I don't been able to

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,060
give him a really good interface that

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,530
fits in with his working day if I gave

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,510
him a simple form that sits in his

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,669
mobile phone but on st. Peter

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,440
developments a poli-sci picture will

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,479
mate retreat makes you free and then

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,400
back boots off it does attend a little

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,169
shoeless then we've got some that's

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,240
really horrible might know there's women

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,740
running face he's building houses he's

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,630
building the whole week and at the end

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,850
of the year and they said v between his

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,680
studies on his website compared to the

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,500
other guy who has to locate and click

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,260
thi you never dulls it and therefore has

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,000
no case studies on this website so if we

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,460
think a little bit more inside the box

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,310
of an organ to WordPress wait and only

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,139
subscribes hugely powerful and virtually

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,300
every business problem has already been

00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,830
solved on the platform and we think

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,960
excited the books we listen to our

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,810
clients problems we can start to really

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,889
powerful things very easily so we're

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,169
going to run you through some real-world

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:02,760
examples of where I take and the

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,910
submittal showed me and Maconie build up

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,830
they talked about custom fields and

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,169
meghanadha in certain extraneous pieces

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,970
of information to this site I'm gonna

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:16,889
show you how we can then build upon but

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:19,139
to deliver business solutions so the

00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,419
first one you're saying at the minute is

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,430
a slideshow of images from the legal and

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,470
that's a little personal passion project

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,840
by a manometer photographer I'm not a

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,690
very good one but I like my work

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,160
so uh-huh all these cool images have

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,690
done it all and I needed to organize

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,900
them in a way that I could find my way

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,610
around them so using the tools I learned

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,190
as it was a very quickly build myself

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,320
for myself a little thing dub site where

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,970
I seem to say I was here and there's the

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,470
full hoops for it and then all the

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,659
sudden speaking Yamuna thought it was I

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,849
was getting this cool website that was

00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:52,320
to bring it all together and then one

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,059
day said having copper teams doing

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,650
better

00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:58,020
workstations in the kitchen - I thought

00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,729
I'd love to see all of the sites about

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,039
all of their being beautiful images my

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,110
favorite images in a slideshow so

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,559
useless were like reason I was really

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,449
easy

00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:08,099
click-click bish bash I had a little

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,289
shortcode that grabs all the featured

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,869
images embackment it's like shield and

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:20,309
that's when you go to watch it like okay

00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:23,059
so we'll get away from to the goal so

00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:26,580
the dive into the deep end here is my

00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:28,050
flagship site this was a client I work

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,659
but after you provide home their

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,370
solutions severe 70 people like into

00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:35,069
your gravity grab this home to provide

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,309
also to Thomas every care they have a

00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:40,409
huge remote distributed workforce so the

00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:42,569
guys are in the cars : drive all sorts

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,639
different regional areas somebody phone

00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,439
sends in to be an office it says don't

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,899
go and see Miss Sally because she said

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,119
she's in hospital all the sausage my

00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,009
cascade of phone calls to try and reach

00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:55,589
the people you like to see Miss Sally to

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,689
get them flavor when I convinced of that

00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,069
company bubbles their main problem was

00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,990
communications there was a couple of

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,610
well phones they were always backed up

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,919
people were gonna text text forgetten

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,569
lost etc so the first thing I was able

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,080
to do was cool a nice WordPress

00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,939
community

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,219
way to get people to talk to each other

00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,749
in a nice private format I started off

00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:16,499
with the peen do you think thumbs up

00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:18,689
here use of p2 thing okay

00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:20,550
so PT thing was an internal tool

00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:23,219
automatic the company behind WordPress

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,680
built to facilitate a team chats so we

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:26,519
used p2 and it worked for a while and it

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,439
may need something more

00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,319
so we went into using the body press

00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,729
tons of use buddypress okay cool so a

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,949
lot more hands out time right

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,439
so bunny press is like a private

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:39,779
Facebook it's a wordpress build this

00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,490
food ends in a provides way but you log

00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,680
in to the site you can put up a quick

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,180
status update log back going and they

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,650
don't really can see that status update

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,990
and start commenting on

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,810
pictures we do without site for Facebook

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,340
for a business with remote workers

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,860
people like the food sort of all the

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,330
office it was transformational all the

00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,310
some people could get in contact with

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,080
each other communications weren't just

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,750
one way anymore they were very symmetric

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,300
one person said something and 3w Idina

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,830
to is able to hear it eccentric so that

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,840
employer about business owner I was

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,210
working with go really excited by what

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,460
WordPress could do for his business and

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,280
he still to this day tortures me with

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,139
cannot do I not scream tactic because

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,090
it's a web developer that guy is

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,100
recurring revenue for me and a nanny

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,470
business recurring revenues three

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,360
olomana for web developers we typically

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,740
build the site and we are you know we

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,600
ask for whatever it is we're gonna ask

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,130
for that site legal in a way we build it

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,620
for everyone takes we go they check you

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,419
boo and then we're back into the food

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,010
loss cycle trying to find fresh weren't

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,320
trying to find a number website to build

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,180
if you've got a client who's coming to

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,610
you every month said all to do something

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,110
else and you know the documents come to

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,690
you for about well then you go findable

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,880
recurring revenue for me as a small

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,620
business owner as it bad it's been

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,540
completely transformational to know but

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,279
every month there's a we met common

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,050
because I thought these guys are adapted

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,529
to redevelop their websites on the

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,000
continual basis so this is like say this

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,160
is the real combination is the biggest

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,709
most complex payment I built to be okay

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,320
and this is an EHR platform so but it's

00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:11,640
probably staff can log in they can send

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,709
messages all around each other

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,870
pickers final mileage expense reports

00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:18,480
they can send direct reports to each

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,890
other they can report on each other and

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,839
completely anonymous whistleblower

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,800
fashion

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,540
supervisors could go out into the field

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,860
to bring up a form and run some pretty

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,170
exciting he might make to you a nice

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,000
compliance supervision at fireside back

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,490
roads - right guys - man those all these

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,350
wonderful great things but it's being

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,620
built on the piece at a time so each of

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,200
our records gave her denied youi focus

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,760
of module that we built one month

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,390
spot-checks

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,040
document check us

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,079
check and driver's licenses about the

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,110
day to check of insurance etc that was

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,720
another long road is - is etc each one

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,670
of these modules was not built because

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,010
we huge Specter trying to give me the

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,390
client could never come written respect

00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,920
because they didn't know all the

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,450
problems they had until they've really

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,640
got diamonds admitted really order a

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,320
word about the client asking their

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,470
promised payment at the end points have

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,300
been knowing but I as an on PHP gifted

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,829
developer to lead on the totals of the

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:19,410
lien on the WordPress community to

00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:21,060
deliver any solution in Northern

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,820
Ireland's we've got a bit of a problem

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,100
with two sites that community you might

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,410
have heard and that poses a particular

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,149
problem for a lot of businesses here

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,250
they want to recruit people like any

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,560
business we're going to WordPress rather

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,720
we say I need a job application

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,570
I need a recruitment plugin and there's

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,430
a whole plethora but not one of them is

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,980
built to ask are you Protestant or a

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,350
Catholic and in Northern Ireland we have

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,410
to pass by question to have a nicely

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,510
credible equal rights equal

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,070
opportunities recruitment process so

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,570
this pine said the ability of

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,970
recruitment for my country staff here

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,310
all day you just come is the photocopy

00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,820
application forms I said yeah sure not a

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,649
problem

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,630
building solution haven't officially

00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,579
said it doesn't find electric Arthur

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,110
repulsive Davis New Year's so that was

00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,820
being on all the white charge people

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,100
ready for this an e-commerce solution

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,350
and that's one of the number things that

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,510
leads by the tiger I hire can build a

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:20,279
custom frame urban forms an easy ways

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:22,290
for customers we've created a Morgan

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,480
Irish compliant recruitment process and

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,279
has become really hardly and it becomes

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,380
something but again is more more

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,910
recurring revenue for me so first of all

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,890
they wanted application forms to go the

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,510
essential data then they wanted an

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,579
automatic reference check so it's only

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,140
fills in the form the platform moves off

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:41,220
on us to referees for the records

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,870
they're not harming us again when we

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,180
hear Venice is complete over it has paid

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,010
for last Christmas service users service

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,990
user records eternity mattaniah

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,550
we build a monogamous they could have a

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,440
centralized place for all the

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,480
information on all of their service

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,730
users all of their needs must more

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,980
importantly all of the interactions

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,529
their staff heart with those service

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,510
users so at any point in time we can go

00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,959
back to say what happened suddenly put a

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,699
sticky plaster on Rome it was Sally that

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,800
was John it was chimney I was a sucker

00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:12,180
plaster and actually they filled it

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,709
before this ad that the plaster all

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,440
correctly are you sure you've got your

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,270
information way so this sort of a puppet

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,550
like saying this is really complex this

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,110
is a way for our timeline but this is

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,699
what you can get to what you've got

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,350
Molly's Mike bills at the understand

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,420
Larry WordPress dolls things I might

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,040
assembly it really make things and then

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,690
you're able to use other plugins they

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,850
advanced custom fields we want to talk

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:37,649
about it's all set to then so custom

00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,240
fields anybody who's at the last talks

00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,160
or custom fields as part of the

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,560
WordPress editor where we can add in

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,360
specific metadata or bits of information

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,069
under pertinent to the page but they

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,290
shouldn't with the main content block

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:51,319
and then we can use PHP early things to

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,870
call that metadata in certain places

00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:56,819
tonight the WordPress editor is awesome

00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,860
it's a point to get an awful lot better

00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:01,769
of a good work development whatever I

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,959
still find user struggling with it they

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,480
just see an interface and that is enough

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,899
for them to who I need to be a techie to

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,000
do this so one of the things I like by

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:16,100
the platform I use tool set is at least

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,190
creating front and and content entry

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,759
straitly symbol what does it mean I mean

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:25,040
this at a client's preview sells cars in

00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,290
the UK there's a whole one of the

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,480
indigenous sort of car sales websites

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,040
that people go to this game is paying a

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,360
fortune but he wants to meet it is own

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,069
thing and not replace that pretty face

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,829
book could you see it when he's involved

00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:39,500
with big guys so he said a car mechanic

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:41,480
so his technical fella but he didn't

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,699
want to go near the interface so we

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,019
built in this body car and this is a

00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:55,790
form where he can enter in all the

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:58,040
details needed to create this so I know

00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,839
the designer Reaver and this site didn't

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,759
get a graphic design treatment so don't

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,490
judge it on the design but more of the

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,740
fact that my mechanic the car sales guy

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,660
as we are honest building but when he

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,430
gets the car into the art he takes the

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,680
pictures on the spoon the odds and the

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,360
details he has upload and it's honest

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,949
website it's a way off the first thing

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,199
he doesn't have to think about anything

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:20,720
he's not blogging in WordPress he's not

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,250
editing a website he's not editing pages

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,899
he's just filled in as before we get

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,329
caught up and then it's getting on with

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:29,149
his work and leaning back to made

00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,250
example avoid a builder any small medium

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,660
business needs to be driven content

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,939
marketing they need to be telling their

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,860
customers what they do for a living they

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,240
need to be sure them examples unlike I

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,480
says because WordPress developers

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,820
they're easy early

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,640
for more business they will do the

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,830
better the community comes so again you

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,960
can see that this format to created the

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,270
vehicle sales page it also created the

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,920
lesson because the waters a PHP

00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,720
templates we can only start to pull this

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,160
payment

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,960
another thing I like waits all set as it

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,060
gives you the option you can if you're

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,620
get a nominee who leaned into attempted

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,540
files it'll give you all the functions

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,580
in the world will call your customer so

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,050
if you're not that way trying to be

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,030
gives you a really nice friendly graphic

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,320
user interface where you can say over in

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,820
this piece of the page you want this pin

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,840
to happen and know where that on

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:18,510
this paper happened so that's talking

00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,350
about really complex examples where we

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:24,300
build up an HR platform for a really

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,970
busy business with an awful lot of staff

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,040
there to conceder their entire staff

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,900
contact our visitor you can't see it

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,050
because presentation to put me in a seat

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,120
over there

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,790
but on a more simple but thinking about

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,090
what WordPress doors right into the box

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,470
before we start to customize it I see an

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,360
awful lot of sites where I'm called in

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,950
to go and fix problems I think one

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,410
there's a plugin started with a hundred

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,340
plugins and that's not a bad thing as

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,410
long as you're all doing something

00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,300
important when I get an area hospital

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,130
favorite at twenty plugins all day

00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,380
something but as a core or a press

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,090
feature and users still get this but

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,120
plugin offers is being offers each other

00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,680
make money by selling plugins doesn't

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,030
matter if it's needed or superfluous

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,500
they're going to make money by selling

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,360
you'll find it these are the plugins

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,510
then you might find it by looking into

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,180
codex or whatever so effectively what

00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:17,760
WordPress does like the box two years

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,440
ago and said complete herd maintenance

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,020
and serenity from in a service business

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,640
to a product based business so instead

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,590
of me being a web developer network that

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,300
Huey did all these cool things as women

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,790
to sell you about so what web say do you

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,670
need and I wanted to get a really clean

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,020
a figure eight and Schubert went while

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,120
sort of website at was they needed

00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,430
because of how to problem managing

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,380
expectations of clients I wanted them to

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,240
know exactly what they were buying from

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,030
me and more importantly exactly what

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,470
they were not buying from me so things

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,910
like they were pressed Souls business

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,550
problems it said Davis turn all the way

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,560
you can do this for yourself your web

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,110
developer well the plot would not sell

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,020
your web products so yeah of course the

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,620
plug so a rebuild website does anybody

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:04,350
recognize the theme hands up recognize

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,570
the team have to create a really good

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,300
because you see their binder websites I

00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:12,060
have built use in 2017 almost finished

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,949
but it's such a good thing I don't so I

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,990
took that visit the store where at

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,820
recipe and this is 2017 whatever you'd

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,850
store WordPress for the first time this

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,680
is the peanuts included one of my bosses

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,900
what business is trying to do the most

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,910
with the least but github and obviously

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,280
my costume your business on spans level

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,290
so there's no point going looking for a

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,870
really fancy thing or writing a really

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,870
fancy thing if the one and the box is

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,930
perfect and that is for my needs

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,070
so then thinking about how I can use

00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:44,220
WordPress and themselves in the box

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,320
etc employers also my problems I realize

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,870
that where commerce was the way to read

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,090
them so that would get possible for you

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,720
and hear me how the movie forms pick it

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:57,480
up so ignore the prices there while

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,730
anybody you might work out but you can

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,440
see here for any possible event if your

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,340
web over hands up if your web developer

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,800
that's your business

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,170
all right okay great stuff so with

00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,480
anybody you see for me I come from a

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,640
marketing sales background that's what I

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,290
did all the days until I got fed up

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,830
explain it to marketing people that

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,540
you just say so

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,120
plus I ended up getting into development

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,040
but I thought that when it came to my

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,300
new business I'd be amazing at selling

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,100
it because it was amazing and selling

00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,200
everybody else's business terms like

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,810
when was my business I was terrible at

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:36,180
settlement because all the good anymore

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:37,920
to me so that's where I really started a

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,260
full-time and when I was having sales

00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,530
conversations with clients I was over

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,940
explained and massively because I'm

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,650
really passionate about your jacket and

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,970
passionate about technology I'm talking

00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,250
to the client that got really fired up

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,020
about what I'm unable to do for them big

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,950
plans just noice no agent always after a

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,100
point you know me

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,290
so usually commerce I was able to get

00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,820
all my products onto my website set a

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,310
price point that's nice and clear and

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,700
apparent for everybody but it also did

00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:09,320
something really cool I'm talking to a

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:12,510
business and they are a hotel restaurant

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,480
owners or there's somebody's trying to

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,210
put on a word all my website I already

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,890
have that solution bundled up I know

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,780
that you trying to figure out of what

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,190
you're worth what my websites going to

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,960
be worth what plugins are not a better

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,160
than what all that costs everything

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,260
figured by the way because I figured

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
like want to be insurance a website or a

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,030
mess applies to any service based

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,980
business yes we provide our services in

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,890
the custom plane but they tend to fall

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,150
and see in progress so the best I was

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,310
able to shoot my clients here we have

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,110
the web page here's all the things that

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,430
are in this particular box of what

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,200
you're getting for price and they say

00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,990
what you're not getting is very clear

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,190
when am I going to meet the client I had

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,750
control

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,250
website and they are going to sales

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,980
collateral in the had to show them

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,570
together the next collateral handle

00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,000
whenever it comes time for that order to

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,730
get closed I'm a hundred members set of

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,340
a proposal and then quote and then the

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,870
cheese back up and then to one master it

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,759
cranks these hills their request apart

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,399
for the details I say brilliant women

00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,200
gopher but here's the link fill in the

00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:16,110
form that customer whose yes I mean

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,179
don't need about but reinforces for them

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,919
exactly what they're buying they didn't

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,019
country the normal rumors check right

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,600
and I get all the information I need to

00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,850
romantic they get their company details

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,399
they get their contact details and most

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,450
important I get their billing details

00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,769
something that's really changed my

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,269
business here and they didn't think

00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,980
about it until I was literally at the

00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:37,799
checkout page together was putting the

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,139
credit card option so sometimes I have

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,179
to wait seven days for you baby but I

00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,710
know that I get notifications when I

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,860
have said your proposal

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,299
hey already into the B's and it's

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,309
brilliant but I didn't think about that

00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:52,440
until they put this together so for my

00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:55,110
business it's become the sales process

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,090
has been completely transformed just by

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,950
less than assemble to WooCommerce

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,809
under the WordPress poster configured

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,029
for my business when I was at since

00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,860
meeting I knew exactly what I'm going to

00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,690
say and exactly one will not have them

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,970
that's all there I'm excited what the

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,250
prices and I know that after sales the

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,200
Bennett I'm pretty terrible is also all

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,789
be taken care of for me

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,789
so the boys

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,399
so we'll just gonna ten-minute warden I

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,529
just want to sort of recap there but

00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:30,960
well you can use various different

00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:34,169
plugins like jetpack lightweight corners

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,500
like toolset types etc to do is lift

00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:39,240
your current skill set where it way way

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,580
above where you may think it is

00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,500
currently two three years ago I would

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,360
never ever have thought I could do these

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,090
sorts of things the only reason why I

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,460
thinking

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,609
as experience of the WordPress community

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,859
I know if I get stuck I will find an

00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:55,659
answer to my question I could walk into

00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:57,849
any client me look my father in the eye

00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:59,649
said we will do it but and I could get

00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,509
to that and dying how to box was you

00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:03,340
trying to say it's or take longer make

00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:04,599

sure recently or content goal thought

00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:25,029
they haven't into pure but I might be

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:30,219
able to cure use of my knowledge of

00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:31,839
plugins and so whatever you're selling

00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:33,339

00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,200
paperwork for you I'm not gonna be for a

00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:31,210
while and then using wait homers

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,769
customizing the we call mercy meals I've

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,359
no idea almost we're gonna stuff itself

00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:36,099
but it's all grounded that's all

00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:38,059
happening automatically

00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:40,159
something else I would like to start the

00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,619
identity is subscriptions so I talked

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,450
about recurring revenue folks beauty

00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,979
says your businesses web development put

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,679
your hands up place again

00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:56,899
I'm figure hound dying if you're not

00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:58,940
getting recurring revenue hands drop

00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:00,469
there so the returned revenue like save

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,609
something that I find which was really

00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:03,320
transformative for me

00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:08,479
first of all when I understood what

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,279
hosting was and I was able then to be

00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,989
personal set up a nice recurring revenue

00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,369
for my business ain't getting a really

00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:14,899
decent WordPress which the environment

00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,299
or customers which they weren't getting

00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:19,339
anywhere else but then on top of that

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,440
like I say beginning to get your clients

00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:23,119
into the idea that no matter what

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,669
probably they give you you will be able

00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,279
to fix it I'm integrating yourself in

00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:30,259
their business problem solving tool kit

00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:31,940
so amantha the business problem then if

00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,799
somebody said for to your economy is

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,059
than something or definite show that

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:36,349
they know team aren't doing right

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:37,849
they're not to inconsistently or

00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,399
something that's the time of you can

00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:41,749
step in and say consistently I can give

00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,700
them the right instructions at the right

00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:45,559
time I did the right information to the

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,179
right people at the right time it's not

00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:48,169
happening right away for your business

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,399
and I assure you

00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:52,279
who said business people you talk to you

00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:54,379
say the wrong information is to great

00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:56,539
people the wrong information gets to the

00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:57,889
you at the rate I'm the vice versa it

00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:00,349
really happens in the right way so

00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:02,209
that's where he uses solution developer

00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:04,159
that business problems already step in

00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:06,169
don't talk about toolset don't talk

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,119
about pass across the fields talk about

00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,919
what problems if you got or PM have you

00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,839
got a right night what can I do to the

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,590
bottom you adapt to fix it for you to

00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:21,049
get it consistently done every

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:24,539
the right way so I'm super time boy so

00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:28,860
are you looking yes you mentioned that

00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:30,750
your car site was firing like updating

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,700
the form of the website obviously and

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,640
also into Facebook what's your weapon of

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,409
choice or social for like social

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,610
automated updating okay so this is

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:41,490
something that makes with the road I

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:44,220
involved yet by Jeff Mike under the Box

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:47,130
does so many things for me but so many

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,419
other things want to do for me and maybe

00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,720
sometimes to do it better and other

00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:53,460
times to do for me I install Jeff Park

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,480
course along the word fence as a

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,700
security measure

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,100
I have spellcheck - in the panel that

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,809
expression so I'm qualified in Google

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,380
Analytics I love good ones they used to

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,990
use it it's lovely I got so tired of

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,250
federal install the Google Analytics

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,440
ready nomination of course comment

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,690
somebody who couldn't afford to DM to

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,149
let this validation report station

00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:18,149
running pages horrible on each rebuilt I

00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:21,450
spent another page what you need if you

00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:22,980
want what was the point of me right now

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,490
in which the court the first place do

00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,200
you know me

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,690
so most users have heard of Google

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,240
Analytics but they're never going to use

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,520
it properly unless they are like to say

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,500
a company with a decent development team

00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,210
a decent content marketing team and

00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,679
they're gonna be able to make changes

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,450
about you're suggesting with analytics

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,460
so nine times out of ten install and

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,100
chef Mike for that analytics package for

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,840
its brute force protection

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,700
it's those some other things and they're

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,500
kind of work sometimes any other work

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,210
other times testimonials feature three

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,399
really helpful projects can be really

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,110
helpful they confident that everything

00:26:53,399 --> 00:27:00,390
always lets me do I'm I don't know if

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:01,770
that's just me so jetpack for me is a

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,809
really good plugins missed again

00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,289
and so it's sort of like a lot of those

00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:06,289
relations

00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:52,269
so I've got a hole in a products fair at

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,370
that site hotels and etc however a lot

00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:56,200
of the time is a custom job the client

00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,509
wants a box but maybe another premium

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,700
plugin so highlights take that extra

00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:02,889
hundred fifty quid and it's easy and a

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,139
copy of product I call it Billy Joel's

00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:07,240
product I opted the price add in the

00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:08,830
option and a drop leg for it so then

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,629
let's say it's it's one of those options

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,059
the clansmen meant to live like you've

00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:14,769
no in superflux you know what's loads of

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:17,379
work and it's expensive to specify

00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:19,179
anything either but a drop down and just

00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:21,039
to reinforce it for decline you know

00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:23,500
this isn't necessary but if you want to

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,549
talk this place went go ahead make my

00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,889
day

00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:29,049
so if that's the way you do spot but

00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:31,090
there's a conversation before item on

00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:32,889
the website and that's where I do sort

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,750
of needs analysis bed and there is a

00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:37,179
really cool tool called a post-it note

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,799
and I love to push that don't forget a

00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,659
really nice fit on session on the client

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,549
what features do you on your website

00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:44,590
do you want to be able log in close to

00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:46,240
them do you want to see a blog posting

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,159
them what else we won't be in secret

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,960
fitness charts been wanting to see how

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,669
much stuff of all of us and if you use

00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,559
post events for that it's really highly

00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:55,480
centralized I won't give it up and then

00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,039
they start making features from the wall

00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:05,529
and of course you're gonna die quality

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:07,950
where's the rest of us and then body in

00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:09,629
my voice vehicle with

00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,759
put us to all these folk even try and

00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:13,979
ask for there's a screenshot but I take

00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,289
a look in the camera Volvo students so

00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:18,090
then I knew that that incident so that

00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:19,739
again when the clients come along they

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,629
had my website they're saying customized

00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:23,309
product though maybe sticks of plant

00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:25,440
bronze and then they're who they love

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:27,119
that they get stock page they see it's

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,919
customized product for them there's all

00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,450
the things I need there's that guy he

00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,549
sucked me for ninety minutes he asked

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,639
every question on the song he knows my

00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:36,389
business inside and I fine he takes

00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:39,869
credit card

00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:42,330
ha ha ha be nice I closed it and again

00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:44,159
the bus were the last mile in sales is

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,929
always the hardest part asking for the

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,279
clothes and asking for the sale this

00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:49,499
makes it really easy so just said to

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,239
across the link as an assaultive clothes

00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:52,679
i just assuming you're gonna order from

00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:54,450
it you get the link if you don't play

00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,619
them out link my heart smell pretty good

00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,690
I'm gonna give you a mobile phone call

00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:59,429
the Satan together okay yes it did but

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,259
uh sporadically or

00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:02,700
ready the table sure if you're still

00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:04,950
home than higher than six months but

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,460
Magnus still be like it for whatever you

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,929
know so at last mile where you got

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,769
really cool custom functionality home

00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:13,109
pretty fine they've had a really

00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:15,119
interesting conversation this last mile

00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:15,809
that's a goal oh yes this is what I'm

00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,820
paying for

00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,289
there's nothing worse you get to halfway

00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,369
through to protect the clients from

00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:23,700
twenty says somebody can do this cheaper

00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:25,679
becomes

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,059
you've got a hundred custom features

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,299
shared antique style the other night but

00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:31,859
no big number of months plus way they

00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,450
can do it cheaper Jimmy

00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:34,679
so again you really lean back on the

00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:37,229
seals fall for it and say what you're

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,429
told 10g bail for you know or in the end

00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:43,139
of the thing where determine I said

00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:44,970
belief O'Leary getting one of these Tony

00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:46,410
you're gonna ye let her get one of those

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,180
we never stuff status on

00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,820
it work it's not your invoice it's not

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,440
your worthless so whatever RZT about so

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,300
for me is its small business owner

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,980
models and expectations was one of the

00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,780
biggest photo matters to me

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,540
so having it all documented in a nice

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,700
rigorous way again all of a body I'm

00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,530
allowed to do I've got three hits two

00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,720

mental so all the paperwork with role in

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,970
the business

00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:12,540
I fired over the week or misunderstand

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:14,070
everybody's just to wrap up do you want

00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:21,390
to see the back and until set because

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:23,430
I'm talking about it so you can see

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,710
hearing into the work as prone in this

00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,830
design once will set and if I come back

00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,630
to this mental site we go to source a oh

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,490
no it's not porn in humanities there's a

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,280
lot of custom things that was not on the

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:39,290
morning but to look at and you see a

00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,290
sight a personal identifiable

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,710
so until set it's a four builder but

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,570
it's not like any other four bill

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,400
arrived I've had a quick let me grab

00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,540
before I recently their support

00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,400
department they couldn't do what I

00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,800
needed it's doing so it never had much

00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,480
more motivated gravity forms and without

00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,550
a goal changed an awful lot of people

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,110
I don't think find contact form seven

00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,940
because it allows for so much

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,800
customizations really easy to get in

00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,150
with possibly working with a pretty ten

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,930
years and I so of course of the

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,410
investment

00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:17,180
however there's things that cannot do so

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:21,230
till said you can see here when I pull

00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:25,670
up this hover over my new as a beast

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:28,100
okay so custom post types hands up you

00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,200
know the custom post type is all right

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,580
custom post type is a is a post and

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,170
slightly different to your normal blog

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,150
posts or your normal goes to the page

00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,880
we've given up clustered man and I

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,740
supposed to use in the custom place so

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,820
whenever we're creating and custom post

00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:47,240
items all set we create a post I say

00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:50,240
that website is in Charbagh words and

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,700
then we create holes in that post type

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,140
to put in information so post fades or

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,240
like ovals and out of this for

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,760
information was it some postings for

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,860
this HR record would be being first in

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,670
employee numbered and national insurance

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:07,310
number exception so then the next piece

00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:09,680
I would use a lot is abused and abused

00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:12,200
is where we can then say okay we've got

00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:17,270
20 employees I want to see was 20

00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,980
employees in a list so here's where

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,140
we've been able to pull in each one of

00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,940
these guys has a big customer segment

00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,860
behind this pull in all information

00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,260
together but for their interaction do

00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,540
service users all the supervision

00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:33,420
history and all that sweet gesture but

00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,940
here refusal refuse to pull this - spit

00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,070
it out salute and it's in the Hughes

00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,570
interface but I turn around and say yes

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,770
I want to see Brittany and what I want

00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,540
to be able link to that custom cool

00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,860
state or the see their phone number I

00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,500
want to see where he worked I want to

00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,800
see it X Y & Z so the insert things that

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,590
you can do in WordPress PHP which is

00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,660
very easy friendly PHP using arrays etc

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,490
but you do have to get into code and

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,380
that's a little bit tricky view use

00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:01,410
allows me to really quickly prototype

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,720
something so the employer might point my

00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,630
client says I want to see business will

00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,790
1902 NBC's mr. messenger I want to see

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,350
that - if it had been an array or maybe

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,300
a bit rate provided and whereas use

00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,190
would use like an additive for on the

00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,570
Flies I don't see it and pull it back

00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,570
road or out - doesn't need to be

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:30,270
so here you can see look a car fighter

00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:32,700
with a car search look at cars later so

00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,260
we went to the car finder

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,369
I built this site last year and I'm

00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,079
desperately trying to remember my lens

00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:42,659
so this is where that's a pretty

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,069
straight forward you can see it but any

00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,549
queries you want much not exactly what's

00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:49,679
going on here so many page though this

00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:51,359
so this people display whose types to

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,500
type some of these your users we can see

00:34:51,359 --> 00:35:01,109
that we're pulling into boost types

00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:03,480
which in this instance is cars so here

00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:05,940
we've got a custom search and this is

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,559
saying it's a little bit trigger but you

00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,349
can see it's saying okay I want you

00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:12,839
select all of the cars that have a many

00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:16,079
people to do some bull or a Volkswagen a

00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:19,549
model v70 or to reg or whatever field

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,170
times transmissions engine sizes etc

00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:24,000
whenever we do that till said

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:26,039
automatically starts the data sort of

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,930
stopped for us know about looks like

00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,480
crazy cool that's the sort of stuff but

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:34,020
what I even got a shot doggy this is

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,690
well over my head however Wetzel said it

00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,339
has all of this in for you and it makes

00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:51,900
it really clear for you where to put

00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:53,760
things so you ready for me however if I

00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,369
needed to get it and customize it it's

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,289
there it's not get in the way it's right

00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:02,520
there for me so it wasn't a huge for you

00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:04,319
it just makes it accessible that's the

00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,299
filter editor and then you could have a

00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:08,640
filter editor not the science what we're

00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,330
going to pull from the database exactly

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,040
which feeds

00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,420
well what we're going to do with those

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,730
speeds that are going to combine them or

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,090
we wanna add massive the mucin to order

00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:21,990
things etc and then by createspace the

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:24,060
exactly an SPS happily by the car finder

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,590
is attempted but build up which says

00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,750
excite me when I would run this report

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,750
here's what I want the results to ready

00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:39,690
whenever you can see that so we can see

00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:41,670
results so here we see the results

00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,310
thrown in some styles together the book

00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:47,250
and write and then we've got on sale for

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,570
and you can see or any not even label to

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,990
the customers out of this comment from

00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,790
the database so you minutes remaining so

00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:55,320
as you can see this for most of us

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,810
developer people were seeing D ties

00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,060
which the appropriate email if you're

00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,590
not a PHP person putting your are maybe

00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,590
a little experience in state development

00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,570
I'm all over this get the CSS like make

00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:09,240
this thing look beautiful because I own

00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:11,220
the sudden tool set up above has done

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,360
all the crazy stuff all the PHP on the

00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,580
fight night with the post eight days

00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,020
what information whose push takes what

00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,480
and what do you want to do with that

00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:23,340
information and I don't hear who develop

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,930
make a pretty make an extra user and

00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,250
then tiny ear gear box of shoes maybe

00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,320
blended two together

00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,450
so what still set it's got all these

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,700
amazing features I've been using the

00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:35,160
money for coming on three years how

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,680
developers really feel quite interesting

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,900
very complex and about the cases for my

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,780
clients what something I there's nine

00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,760
percent about

00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,710
not touched because I haven't needed to

00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,810
because there's so much in there some of

00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:51,130
it's very very very portable if it's

00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:53,410
your thing it's the ladies so I need to

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,540
test pH builders I'm trying to warm up

00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,490
or screech the bird that I do test page

00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,110
builders does the apparently don't do

00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,940
what you see what you get you don't get

00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,220
what you see you know whenever you're

00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,050
prototyping page but we can be Honda if

00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,240
you know your way around it till set

00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:10,300
house one built-in whereby you can set

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,830
up a template for your cars nine I like

00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,930
to tell them things I think we're gonna

00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:17,080
do an awful lot faster than any other

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,760
way of interfacing with a website but

00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,830
for best websites where the clients can

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,150
really think even where would one or you

00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,250
need to have the engine number about

00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,720
this you need to do this doing it this

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,460
way which is really handy because it

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,260
meant begin sitting with them on the fly

00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:32,860
I could just basically masterplan so

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:39,160
this is a when you click drag and drop

00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:40,690
editor whereby I'll show you I'll show

00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,540
you if I add in a room you're gonna see

00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:48,940
so this is the car speech this is this

00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:54,430
bad boy if I can join here you can see

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:56,980
I'm in a room select how many columns we

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,890
want whatever we're putting on here T so

00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,120
they fill with night says what you want

00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,430
hood in here and a supporter base is

00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,410
different it makes our page 10 our page

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,970
builders and the fact that we can see

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,310
here it's asking us to want to do just

00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:12,340
normal stuff joining fill in just

00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:14,020
standard avi source content etc John

00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,230
little spiders running bats on preview

00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:19,450
stuff totally some funky Lego things or

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,700
mess this visual editor as weird real

00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,200
interesting stuff hogs because this is

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,490
where we could build in all that complex

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,950
stuff with build up in the database

00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,840
before so this just looks like a normal

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,900
WordPress editor but we've got these

00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,060
funky buttons

00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,900
credit forms not a logical in any

00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:37,850
bookstore user forms of the credit I'm

00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,680
another field some views and this is

00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:43,940
whereby you can see it brings it's not a

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,890
word press dot it breaks in user data it

00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,690
brings in here you can see our custom

00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,780
who staked out so this is where I didn't

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:53,300
say yeah okay engine sightings at the

00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,820
very top there you'll be happy 92.9

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,440
meter right in stuff whereas before it

00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,210
was a bit long so this is where I can

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,280
say he's not visual editor books I

00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:03,530
grabbed my rope and I said okay this is

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,970
bulletproof annoying it's like exactly

00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,010
one on one way to dot this tip here

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,530
another so it's very easy to quickly

00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,450
very very quickly walk off a very

00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,000
complex layer use and all sorts of data

00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,380
dynamic W stripped of information right
