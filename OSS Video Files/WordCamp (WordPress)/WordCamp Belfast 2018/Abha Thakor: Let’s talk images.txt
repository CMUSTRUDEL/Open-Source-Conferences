[Applause]

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:23,220
so say chocolate emerges without images

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,350
so we're gonna try and work through

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,800
quite a lot in this session and then

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,690
we've got a lovely panel for you who are

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,239
really experts on images as well so

00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:37,230
you'll be able to include some tips from

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,969
them to see Ezek I like people being

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,690
interactive you might notice that last

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,690
few days how many of you take pictures

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:51,629
how many people how many of you take

00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:59,370
pictures when plants yourself as

00:00:51,629 --> 00:01:03,329
photographers quite a sensation okay and

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,880
how many of that number would consider

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:18,630
late they are fully conversant with

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:20,340
copyright and protect America's images

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,100
that you know resolved with more perfect

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,770
and a single picture can tell 5,000

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,860
words 10,000 words B depending on its

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,549
artistic that you're using at the time

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:36,390
we don't often hear the right image you

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,469
can do far more the wrong image can do a

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,680
lot of damage

00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:44,159
I didn't subscribe to the theory that

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,369
any publicity is good

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,079
nor do Isis close the theory that it

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,689
doesn't matter snip of a pictures of

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:57,270
happiness I also do a little Isis

00:01:51,689 --> 00:02:00,240
management work and if I had a penny but

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,189
everybody who tells me that but you know

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,820
we didn't know if that feature fear

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,359
problem

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,100
I feel very much so safely lands

00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,479
presentation we've covered some more

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,989
tips that you think about when you're

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,180
using images on the on the web

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,959
say

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,299
as you all know because you will be

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,970
quite advanced WordPress users or web

00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:25,310
people images really boost online

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,709
engagements they make a real difference

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,260
they make the real difference to the

00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:33,379
bottom line as well so if you are

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,689
telling your your boss if you're telling

00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:40,030
your project Lee or you're trying to

00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:43,579
sell your services to an organization

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:47,120
absolutely quantifying how images and

00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:49,670
the need for a budget on images can make

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,859
a difference is really important and

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:58,819
thinking about it and trusting that up

00:02:51,859 --> 00:03:02,629
front I feel like with plants who who

00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:05,329
have this great idea of a campaign they

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:07,489
don't have an image budget when it comes

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,139
to delivering the project and that's

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,220
we're getting a really good online

00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:19,129
engagement

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:21,590
it lives or falls apart image images can

00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:25,190
really help your content and that's not

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,419
just in people thinking of Rights you

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,609
know I'll have a look at this picture

00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:32,989
and therefore it's not unless you your

00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:34,780
content they can actually help drive all

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,980
your content Kasparov's

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,889
there's food there's a lot of research

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,269
being published over the last ten years

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:44,090
about the content that works for

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:47,150
pictures and then once at doe this is a

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:51,049
quick show of hands which do you think

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:56,120
would be the more content rich for

00:03:51,049 --> 00:04:01,549
images on the category sports or news so

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:07,099
sports okay

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:13,069
I'm use okay it's actually even split in

00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:14,690
that it actually is sports so we've all

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,820
done it we've gone to the back of our

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,829
newspaper and seeing the image on the

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,709
back page of the newspaper other a

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,080
sporting picture even people who have no

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,669
idea about the offside rule which I

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,789
really still don't understand

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:33,120
so it's no different on the web in fact

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:36,449
it's even greater the right image can

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,620
really make a huge difference as if I

00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,110
was on the PowerPoint yeah we can

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,759
increase traffic to ecommerce we have a

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,939
calls to action and we can make a

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,490
difference for our brand awareness how

00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:50,460
many of you can think of a single image

00:04:47,490 --> 00:05:17,729
right now that on a website that you

00:04:50,460 --> 00:05:22,650
have seen that sticks in your mind any

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:24,719
any of us non-sporting what images that

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,150
are you've seen on the web on the web

00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:30,270
and you thought that makes me remember

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,729
it was raining yesterday of to Korea

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:40,139
Peters well we look like a pendant on

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:44,490
that brick and end of the day that is

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:46,680
what major companies know and if you're

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,379
pitching to a major company or you are

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,419
trying to work for that with their

00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,360
marketing team or their branding

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,810
campaign teams actually being able to

00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,800
quantify that this will have a result an

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:04,650
effect on how much their sales can be

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,069
affected how much their new e-commerce

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,089
platform will actually be you

00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:11,250
particularly when they've got to spend a

00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,750
huge amount of money on a platform that

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,669
they haven't thought about having a

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,330
picture budget forked and it happens

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:22,800
time and time again campaigns aren't

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:25,500
charities that have amazing really

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,650
amazing calls to action but don't have

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,139
an image to go with it so they don't

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,630
have a particular thing that will make

00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,599
people stop and think actually this is

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,180
something that I need to do and the

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,759
blood transfusion

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,620
units did an amazing campaign last year

00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,759
and coated people to to give blood and

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,250
surprisingly they didn't have a picture

00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,560
of some of their arm out giving blood

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,880
because actually that would have put

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:59,270
people off but the most obvious picture

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,830
actually is just that so when people

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,509
were pitching and discussing this

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,820
campaign and say actually you know you

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,280
could do that you could do that it's

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:11,150
actually looking at how effective is

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:15,490
that image going to be equally having a

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:19,340
picture of a model in a beautiful dress

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:22,729
may sell a car but it's not going to

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,560
necessarily sell a product that you want

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:29,270
touching people to go and buy in a shop

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,460
for hard work so so it's making it

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,720
relevant it's also not being cheesy and

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:39,710
it's not bringing your brand disrepute

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:43,520
the UM on average total views on on

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:46,039
contact increased by 94% if a published

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,889
article contained a relevant photograph

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,949
or infographic when compared to articles

00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:57,650
without any image in the same category

00:07:50,949 --> 00:08:00,020
do you all use infographics higher

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,330
percent of the thought any photograph

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,000
it's a really good way of you getting

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,310
information other they're not that

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,110
expensive these days to create a source

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,030
of templates out there that you can also

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,789
use just check the advertising that goes

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,070
with that because with the new GDP on

00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:23,479
regulations there are thinkers you be

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:25,849
aware there are unique images also make

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,090
a difference in categories particularly

00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:31,699
news so columns give an example today

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,430
about the about the news image grip so

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:36,560
if it's mine there's a lot of things

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:40,159
that actually if you're working on a new

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,079
site or make up a blog is not reusing an

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,410
image that is going to be used in

00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:48,620
hundreds of other websites because

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,200
actually if that person whose use coming

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,110
to your site has seen that image say

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,330
many times that and they really it's

00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:00,620
just go switch them off there was a

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:04,480
political campaign a couple of years ago

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:08,330
in England where a particularly small

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,510
party decided to use some images that

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,180
were in a photo library that they just a

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,640
free library they decide to use those it

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,460
hadn't knock-on effect to the other

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,980
people who were using those images

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,750
because certainly they rebranded and by

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,080
a particular party

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,180
so again if you do use free libraries

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,180
have a look where else are they being

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,350
used because you certainly could be

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,640
saying a completely different thing

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:41,120
about your brand search optimizing your

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:44,930
images of really important and the

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,120
metadata that you use on that I hear a

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,250
lot that people say okay let's do that

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,400
anymore because we wasn't carrying or

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,500
watching people the scrapped and more

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,950
importantly so do the people who are

00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,730
reading your story if you didn't search

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,280
for a particular piece of content it may

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,010
be the search engine will find your

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:11,390
amazing blog you're amazing your product

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:14,000
because they find the image say don't

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,240
just presume that an image is the thing

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,220
that will actually help after everything

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,680
else it could be worksheet drives people

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:26,540
on the first place the amp'd the quality

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,820
of a product image can be really

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:35,900
important I probably see about 40 to 50

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,330
examples a day of images that are so

00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:42,160
poor for the brands that they're trying

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:44,270
to advertise and people to survive

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,180
Trading Standards are having a real

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,430
issue at the moment where companies are

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:54,290
putting up an image to reflect even a

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:58,400
web service and and they using that

00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:01,220
image to define and to actually value

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,830
that product so there was a company

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,970
let's just being the papers to do search

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,620
Google for

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,399
for their survival meaning accompanying

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:14,480
a presentation that used a whole lot of

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,610
images really really nice pictures I've

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,970
related to their product but they've

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,279
looked better than that comet people

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,949
bought this product on the basis of

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,680
these pictures they didn't have this

00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:30,949
flame anywhere that said actually don't

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,379
do these pictures don't reflect what you

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:36,050
might be buying so people quite rightly

00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:38,420
thought this is where I'm fine

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,649
this is great it's equipment of violence

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,379
you know thinking you buying a Ferrari

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,300
and and and ending up what the four

00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:49,759
galaxies no offense to all the cars in

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:51,470
this so be really really clear about

00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,470
what you're you are saying about

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:58,069
particularly ecommerce because you could

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,980
be forming a contract with the person

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:04,269
buying your product or your service

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,889
based on the image that you are choosing

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:09,259
and it doesn't title people to reap on

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,660
claims or at least they can wrap your

00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:13,819
firm up especially from all funds in a

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,139
lot of red tape while are you actually

00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:19,939
honking it know your audience and being

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:22,160
sensitive to both of choices and

00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:25,399
legislation in the country another

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,370
client who's just started working in

00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,439
parts of Asia and she's got lots of

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,680
pictures on her site and people just

00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:37,730
sitting relaxed she has she sells

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,339
trainers these other trainers most of

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,470
her pictures are with people such as

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:45,410
most people in this room are so they've

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,329
got less what's up bring a lot of a lot

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,899
of Asian countries that would be really

00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:53,329
offensive and because that's where she

00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:56,120
must sell to as well she needs to think

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,860
about the images that she uses and she

00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,660
doesn't want to create a site that would

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,240
have to be changed for different

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,980
countries so trying to get something

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,129
that will work everywhere as much as

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,569
possible having a mixed agendas also

00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:11,420
makes a difference if you're trying to

00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:15,100
sell a big salad a fire to a service and

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:18,390
the only pictures on your site or of

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,010
mail people stock photos

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,830
and haven't got a woman in those

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,150
pictures quite rightly your customers

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:31,440
thing I think well that products not for

00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:35,040
me so every image should tell us

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:39,600
tell us stories so if it's not telling a

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,790
story quite frankly why is it there but

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,100
also it needs to be delivering what your

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:48,780
key images look so your key messages

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:51,300
your brand actually are clear B we were

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:54,420
talking about this yesterday with work

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,660
at one time has a big W so beautiful no

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,200
that's something to do with WordPress if

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,300
it has something completely unrelated

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,850
like a shoe you want to sell we think

00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,920
that had to do with with you with your

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,080
bra and you have to use every

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,740
opportunity it's a competitive

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,100
marketplace to reinforce your brand and

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:21,620
to help people find you remember you

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,620
come back to you and stick with you

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:29,280
speed and load is really important and I

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,980
talk to lots of web people on a regular

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,060
basis where they hit that handy mix of

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,980
wall because they're working with a firm

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,080
organization where they get in content

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,560
they're getting images but the images

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,540
are not fit for purpose and they'll have

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,940
beautiful websites they have over to

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:52,950
their clients within two days the

00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:56,790
websites broke most times it's only

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:59,850
broke because they've uploaded to gig

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,920
video on to the home page and they

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,460
wonder why the web page my work load and

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,590
the home page not life now a lot of

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,600
hosts will allow you to do that some

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,330
posts a bit more responsible and won't

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,820
let me do that and and that's to be

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:17,610
commended

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,490
also some hosts will will have systems

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,680
where you can have a clicker load for

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,080
certain pages so all these things are

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,880
worth looking at when you're picking a

00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,090
host and when you're looking at what

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,920
pictures to use it isn't hard to reduce

00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,500
the size of the web picture

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,070
but if you are handing over a website to

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,320
a client get it in writing that as part

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,320
of your service level agreement a part

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,020
of your handling the document somewhere

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,110
that says this is what the recommended

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:52,050
size of the picture should be and that

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,440
if they upload larger pictures of

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,450
pictures that are not copyright free

00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:03,240
that you will not have any liability for

00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:05,940
that we all know about images on

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,130
smartphones and how they should look how

00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,090
they look on tablets where the best way

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:13,140
of making them use them is and yet a

00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,860
researchers published a couple of weeks

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,630
ago said that 20% of websites have

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,050
pictures that are not suitable for

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,970
tablet use that you can see it it would

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:27,240
take you about 10 minutes to scroll on

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,640
your tablet to see the picture if you

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,270
weren't bad at - at the moment it ever

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,010
used for some moments Hubble the

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,950
contours over you have red bar click on

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:40,440
boomers you can create a program you can

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:44,550
create a whole story board using images

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,920
and Twitter the only problem is is it

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,720
won't necessarily reduce your picture to

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,030
the size that you want it so you could

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,400
have a lovely stream on Twitter and then

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,190
suddenly on a a massive picture you

00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:01,860
can't get lost so always look at what

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:04,140
where you will display that bring it

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,050
back to work class choosing these themes

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,070
your image resources is really important

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,750
a quick checklist

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:14,340
there are obviously lot more things that

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:16,260
you could use and and I decided I was

00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:20,240
going to you see a finish English for

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:23,460
optimize which also doesn't like so

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,330
there are lots of themes now where you

00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:30,180
can have a featured image as an auto

00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:34,290
option so if you have a news type theme

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:37,200
blog site where you want an image to

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,960
automatically appear on every post up

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,210
here on your home page so you don't have

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,370
to actually do other kind isn't do it

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,090
there are things that will let you do

00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,559
that

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:52,499
automatic there are also plugins that

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,779
will let you but where that feature

00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:58,830
image is to be shown and where it's not

00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:01,620
there's some readings rubbish things out

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:04,200
there where they will put a featured

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,169
image on the home page

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:13,200
they'll also put it as a big file on

00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:14,879
your post on your RSS feed and nobody

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,999
can to get to your content because they

00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:20,610
can't get past that image so do check in

00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:22,320
the in the details for a thing if images

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,070
are important to you and you want to use

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,940
me to post because it's time-consuming

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,830
changing your things I won't I won't

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,440
read it worked and athletically pretty

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:37,129
straightforward list just making sure

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,210
it's all clear and easy to use and

00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:44,960
getting people to understand why you

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:47,730
want to learn to use it that way the M

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,740
so that's featured images in check how

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,340
it wants to appear on this particular

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,379
theme you can see that the actual

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:59,610
featured isn't it only included the top

00:18:55,379 --> 00:19:02,129
top half which may been alright that

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:05,399
image which may make no sense whatsoever

00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:06,990
as an automated field the first time

00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:09,019
you'd know about it is when you start

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:16,080
getting comments that may not be

00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:23,629
complimentary what do you think of when

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:31,590
you see that image do you see when you

00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:35,639
see an apple for a user who has a visual

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:38,429
difficulty they may see nothing one of

00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:40,559
my since I've been training about

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:43,470
accessibility is getting people to

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,830
understand actually it may be really

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,509
simple to you it's an apple but what

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,149
will be nice for someone sometimes and

00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:55,740
still our screen we go these it's a bad

00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:57,750
apple style table it may seem really

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,179
obvious and you think why they want to

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,799
know

00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:05,339
the the most frequent contact that

00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:08,199
organizations actually put in is a space

00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:11,379
so they go to the outside because some

00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:14,799
developers be cover and they put Amanda

00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:16,809
to field for all tags so they have to

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,639
put something in and then it round it by

00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:27,699
pressing the spacebar really unhelpful

00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:30,549
please go through that say yeah but also

00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:33,609
if you are copying and pasting text

00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:35,499
I believe use different fonts like then

00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:37,389
sling Meetup this is nothing that people

00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:39,219
tend to do because it they write all

00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:41,529
their tags that pitch descriptions in

00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:45,699
Microsoft Word and I make its copy

00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:47,199
directly from word into both US and the

00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:50,339
old time but of course that doesn't

00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:53,079
remove the coating so what might display

00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:55,829
depending how you set up your alter my

00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:58,689
that should be quite confusing and

00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:00,629
google mount uses all types choose they

00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:03,129
actually you can search on all types and

00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:04,959
though it's tool is a little naming and

00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:09,219
shaming hopefully not take the knowledge

00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:14,739
of deck with anyone potential image

00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:18,249
sources who I'm sure you wouldn't think

00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:22,599
this in this room but um we ask the

00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:24,849
question as a young age wise event can

00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:27,099
you do your clients think that they can

00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:39,849
get a picture from anywhere in the web

00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:42,959
and use it on though most people do you

00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:45,819
think you have any liability for that

00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:47,229
yeah you're posting it on there you know

00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,989
of course you do if you're the one

00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:54,629
putting it off you say when you can

00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:57,789
visit my website it's fine amazing

00:21:54,629 --> 00:22:00,699
documentation really important make it

00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:03,729
clear where the responsibility lies

00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:07,209
where your responsibility stops and

00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:10,470
where it begins and also be helpful

00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:12,900
don't have to make them fear their lives

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,020
just actually you can say to them if you

00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,880
would like some extra advice on this

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,940
picture and consultancy picks your

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,940
maintenance cream I am the hella

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,240
plantations in Brighton and lusty leaks

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,190
where developers will note biggest

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,559
problems was their clients are coming

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:35,190
back after the maintenance agreements

00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,799
had lapsed and saying you're responsible

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,679
we've done this but you're responsible

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:43,289
we just got a bill because we downloaded

00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,780
a picture it's coming the post they've

00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:48,059
tracked our IP address and the interest

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,690
is being charged daily but you have to

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:54,600
pay it in some cases the development

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,929
can't get out of it because there was no

00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,900
nothing in writing there was nothing

00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:05,130
that said my responsibility formally

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:08,820
finishes at I am no longer the legal

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:10,980
publisher now the GTR is even more

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,200
important to be very clear the

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,429
boundaries and be player of where and

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,010
what you're responsible for and also to

00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:22,590
be responsible in your own stance so

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,740
that if you have used pictures as

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:28,620
temporary items not for publication and

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,169
they appear on publication and they're

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,140
actually from one of these table top

00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:36,780
agencies you've actually said to the

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:43,530
client it is your responsibility to

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:45,830
change that there are really good sites

00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:49,200
out there where you can use pixabay

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:51,929
unsplash case of a discus careful there

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,659
are no links a top and the bottom of

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:56,940
each webpage which are not worlds in

00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,730
three pictures and it is slightly

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:03,120
confusing and some users get caught out

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:06,450
well the best tips for any of the sites

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,659
like pixabay unsplash it sets yourself

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:12,120
up a free account you can then keep

00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:14,370
track of the pictures that you've

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,820
downloaded when you've downloaded that

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:20,520
and you can actually do an export to

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:24,000
working out where they've been used so

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,580
if you have a problem radios down

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,480
you don't have the issue of how do I get

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:33,790
that picture how do I prove that it was

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,880
from a free site that you have

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:39,910
commissioned I have some points that I

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,340
have to say take sling shots take screen

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,860
shots date and time them where you've

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,910
actually thought maybe success there is

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:51,570
no cost of us it is free to use and what

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,370
the criteria is but even on the site

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,250
look at they're tempting conditions and

00:24:54,370 --> 00:25:00,400
look at the profile the who has given

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:03,460
those pictures it's quite awesome they

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,420
will stipulate my picture cannot be used

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,520
in these circumstances and in those

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:13,540
circumstances you would not necessarily

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,730
have the right to use that picture we've

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,850
covered already about being aware of who

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,740
may be using the same image and if you

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:26,490
have a client that tells you no really

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:30,040
will ever know I will walk away

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:32,710
get yourself an agreement or be really

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,870
clear that you are telling them that IP

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,720
addresses are registered by these

00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,750
websites we're going into with

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,850
blockchain it is going to be a doddle to

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,190
be able to stay to see where pictures

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,170
are comfortable and there are now two

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:50,770
companies operating from Germany that

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:53,950
are actually making it their job to go

00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:57,130
and take action against organisations

00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,840
and individuals using blockchain

00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:04,600
technology and seeing where pictures

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:08,890
have been used no such things that freed

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:12,310
you you know it is really true I'm in

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:14,650
February this year Google and Getty

00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:18,760
stock photo images came to an agreement

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:23,980
about images and that still being kind

00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:25,450
of because it was it found that people

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,100
are seeing the image on Google search

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,490
but they weren't actually clicking

00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:33,400
through to the product so that's the

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,590
lost revenue but also why bother doing

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,540
all that it knows going to actually see

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,100
the image say look

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:44,230
the developments on that they'll be

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,760
coming the next month or so some some

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,550
websites too painful the ability to

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,860
right-click see if you have an image

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,320
that's really important if your CEO is

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:57,460
in a picture that you do not want to be

00:26:53,320 --> 00:27:01,480
news for a comedy issue or you've got a

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:03,100
campaign that's really unpopular be

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,810
careful about what pictures you have out

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:10,170
there they're really good material for

00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:10,170
cartoons and but the negative campaigns

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,400
respect others IP and copyright goes

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,320
without saying because I'm sure talking

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:25,120
to work best community we all understand

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:30,190
that these are the things I probably

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,590
hear most times I can save any image I

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,090
might find on the web no one will know

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:37,060
if your site doesn't get a lot of

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:39,490
traffic I don't care if it gets three

00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:42,130
people if you put an image and if you've

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,350
ripped off someone's copyright but the

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:48,790
technology that we have now with AIT

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:51,610
building it will be trapped and the

00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:54,220
bills don't care whether you are an

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,170
individual whether it's someone's little

00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:59,530
boy to put that over you he'll be

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:05,740
website the outlet of that family won't

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:08,500
get a bill Hammack times have you had

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,810
the experience where your client is

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,760
sending new pictures to use do you

00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,350
always chat with them that their

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,810
copyright for it do you have

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,370
documentation that shows that you can

00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,890
use those pictures or do you just

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:29,470
happily upload the pictures and not

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:34,240
worry about it my advice and only advice

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:39,360
be careful because if you didn't ask and

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:44,020
they have breached copyright I'd be gdpr

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:47,800
anything really you are jointly

00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,530
responsible and you would have to show

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,280
due diligence

00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:56,100
be costly every time consuming what

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,700
steps you took to make sure that image

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,980
was safe to be used now that doesn't

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,180
mean just sending your client and though

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,550
it's saying right you are now

00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,040
responsible for everything I've got no

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,930
responsibility at all and that's it you

00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,800
know job done

00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:15,840
you could not fill that I've just done a

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,880
client who Mukesh brought up the

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,880
schedule of services that he's now

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,800
pitching back to the company who we

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,860
creates the website for three years ago

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,540
not paying a penny sense and he's going

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,280
to mind sharing rich like reformer it's

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,100
going to be nice to you BP are compliant

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,710
library he's just got a lovely contract

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,440
that will bring you your own yeah but

00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:40,080
actually he'll do it well so think about

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,030
how that affects your business model but

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,800
more importantly check with your

00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,800
insurance because we've all got

00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:49,110
insurance these days and check one it

00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:53,460
says about where you are responsible to

00:29:49,110 --> 00:30:02,100
begins motor stops so if I can manage to

00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:11,480
get the see while I'm trying to find the

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:48,150
the other webpage when when you think of

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:52,740
when you think of images images can be

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:57,180
so much more okay so much make really

00:30:52,740 --> 00:31:00,300
good in just up so much so that the

00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,570
Ordnance Survey it's a great business

00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,870
mother former so

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:09,049
if you see a map and it's based on the

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:12,529
orphan survey don't just reproduce it

00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:15,679
without checking because Ordnance Survey

00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:20,620
material is copyrighted and a lot of

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,600
maps can't be reproduced the young

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:28,190
Longwell is the most beautiful place I

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:31,490
have been just amazed and it's inspired

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:33,259
by how beautiful is so when you're

00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:37,730
producing image galleries for your

00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:41,779
company to your over themselves start

00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:44,750
developing galleries that actually look

00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:47,149
at a different variety of images but

00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:52,789
also what is being said about your brand

00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:55,759
already see if you sell coats what else

00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:57,590
is that left tracking images and

00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,330
tracking branding is really important

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,730
because you can see where the

00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,409
competition is what's being said you can

00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,980
change the message you can change the

00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:06,649
story

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,480
you can also be inspired by what you see

00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:12,409
and you can start a dialogue and

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:22,070
engagement with a whole new community by

00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:25,509
by doing that um why wouldn't to suggest

00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:29,299
is that we have some really really cool

00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:32,570
image people in this room well then is

00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:35,029
is Kalin here from there for SP and

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:38,090
we've got mark who this works a

00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:42,559
photographer and still take for making

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:44,029
pictures and : lots of images so I think

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,190
we're really nice if we actually opened

00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:48,919
up the questions say that greatness you

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,670
also could participate just before we do

00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:54,929
let's give our

00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,929
