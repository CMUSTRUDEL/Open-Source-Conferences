Title: Luminus Olumide Alabi: The Power of Open Source. How WordPress Saved My Life!
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	Open Source is an incredibly powerful concept that can be seen at the heart of progress and advancement in many spheres of life. The idea that people from every corner of the globe can come together to exchange ideas and build products that profoundly affect our lives is as crazy as it is exciting.
Iâ€™m fascinated by the fact that people who have never met can come together to form a community that produces software and/or hardware products like CMSs, cars, building equipment, AI appliances and apparel that help to enable whole swaths of people with limited financial, physical or other resources make meaningful contributions and improve their quality of life.
I talk briefly about the concept of Open source and specifically about how WordPress has played a significant part in taking this Nigerian university dropout around the world and exposing him to a community of the most incredible human beings at the forefront of democratising publishing and why Open Source should be near and dear to your heart.

	00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,330
and I'm going to talk to you today about

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:11,580
the probability source and how WordPress

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,839
is April 8th so Who am I I'm the happy

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,969
to send you here with automatic I

00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:18,349
provide support for customers that are

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:22,050
building ecommerce sites using commerce

00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:25,470
the university dropout how you see why

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,849
that's important later on also an open

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,730
source enthusiast I believe in the power

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:35,760
of open source here so first of all what

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,870
an open source for me I believe that the

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,539
heart of open source is an open

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,640
collaboration and open cooperative a to

00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,910
be any system of innovation or

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,530
production that relies on goal-oriented

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,170
yet moosh we organized Cordillera who

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,079
interact to create a product or service

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,399
of value which they make available to

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,230
contributors and no contribute doesn't

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,000
like which is essentially what we're

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,559
doing yeah the key things there are

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,750
people come together around a common

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,659
goal they create a product or service

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,299
that has some economic value and it's

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,159
offered to both the computer than people

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,259
who aren't contributing to it equally

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:26,400
and generally busy which we organize

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:28,380
loosely coordinated now open sourced an

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,920
impact pretty much any field of even

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,090
endeavor and encompasses both open

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,640
source software and open source hardware

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,780
a lot of the time when we hear open

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,420
source people just think about software

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,280
which is what WordPress is but there's

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,290
an open source hardware as well which

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,310
stuns a lot of people the first time

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,619
they hear that

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,110
I'm going quickly go into a few of my

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,049
favorite open source hardware products

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,020
just to show how that how that is and

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:59,520
then I'm going to tie that back to work

00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,829
so the first one is crucial 3d printed

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,490
who who here knows anything about 3d

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,369
printing so

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:13,020
to e3 printing is a process where you

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:16,500
can make whatever you want so like you

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,390
want a cup you can either go to shop and

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,380
buy one or you can have you can print

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,910
one from from materials in your own home

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,760
this 3% particular is really cool

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,000
because even though this company sells

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,069
the 3d printer they have the plans for

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,410
it available online in print you can

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,580
download it go buy the material put it

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:41,040
together yourself and even when you buy

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,209
from them I said they have an

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,780
instructional style equation because

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:49,860
they 3d print your 3d printer with the

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:53,880
3d printers they already have ridiculous

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:58,050
so anything from like making toys making

00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,630
cool tools making prototypes of little

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,970
products like oh you want to go into

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,319
production of that water bottle there

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,489
but you don't know if anybody's really

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,870
gonna like it you don't want to have to

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,790
order like a container load of stuff

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,829
from China and then find out that nobody

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,950
wants to buy it you can print three of

00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:15,329
them and say do you like it and son says

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,530
yes alright when you pay ten pounds for

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,090
it and they can put ten pounds in your

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,010
hand right away and you're like alright

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,780
this maybe this has a Peter yeah

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,930
this next one is called Mycroft it's an

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,170
open-source AI so think Alexa or Google

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,760
home but this is you get to contribute

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,930
to the code you get to see all the code

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,700
you know exactly what's running there

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,650
it's private it's custom it's not

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,000
listening to every everything that

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,410
you're saying I'm recording you it

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,820
doesn't last a virus to eat in the

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:50,519
background and even though they want to

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,560
use your voice to train the AI you have

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,950
to opt in so it's got privacy by design

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,269
built into it where if you want them to

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,130
record your voice you have to go find

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,739
the setting and say could you call my

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,579
voice which is awesome and you can do

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,380
cool things like um first of all you can

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,489
change the the call me if you don't want

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,739
to be hold my coffee woman to be called

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,520
me we can have they call me on say hey

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,200
Neal what's the time

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,160
edinburg they'll tell you if you're a

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,000
different country yeah it needs to

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,530
convert I'll tell you that how many

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,300
teaspoons are the tablespoon it'll go on

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,950
WolframAlpha and you'll figure out that

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,070
and they'll tell you you can display on

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,740
the screen and you can give you a voice

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,350
prompt as well and you can teach it

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,980
really really cool things they've also

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,960
got my back a back on Kickstarter and I

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,760
got the developer kit so what you get

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,270
instead of getting a product like that

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,060
you get all the parts that you have to

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,550
put together yourself and you get the

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,260
schematics for 3d printing the the

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,510
casing so you can then go and 3d print

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,120
it which means that you can make more

00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,600
whenever you want and this is something

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,800
that and once once I get it it's gonna

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,850
be a project that I work on with my

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,810
seven-year-old we're gonna put it

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,130
together - together as a team and it's a

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,680
sneaky way of introducing him to the

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,920
coding because you can write all the

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,800
code in Python which shows language as

00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,870
well but he for him it's just oh I need

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,340
to make it do this cool thing so it's

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,750
not like this huge task of I need to

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,620
learn Python just I need to make it do

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,510
this one thing and finally this is a

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,169
global village construction set which is

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,630
just a DIY low-cost modular iPhones

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:36,390
platform that allows for easy

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,120
fabrication of 50-plus induction

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:43,440
machines that that you need to build a

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,840
thriving ecosystem or but if you say

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,240
build your own little village or little

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,770
city you can buy all these all these

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,830
pieces of equipment but they're pretty

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,230
expensive or you can make them yourself

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,450
because all the plans are available they

00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,000
tell you exactly what part you need how

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,320
many screws what size where they go the

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,940
schematics is there for you to put put

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,610
them together and you've got things like

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,100
a bulldozer or a cement mixer a curry of

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,850
a wind turbine that you can do yourself

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:16,140
if you were into that kind of thing so

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:17,940
you I find that it gives a lot of a lot

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,100
of power to be able to do things things

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,930
that you want and if you go back to

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,240
software this is it exactly what

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,400
WordPress does

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,880
WordPress is basically to democratize

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,330
publishing ah you don't have to have the

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:36,120
the financial clout of The Washington

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,009
Times or those are Washington Post or

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,240
New York Times or any other publications

00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:43,500
before you can write something or get

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,550
get your word out there so we all know

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,470
that it's an open source content

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,000
management system but Bernie posture you

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:55,289
can on the web and turns 5015 tomorrow

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,840
it's incredible but in 15 years that

00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,310
this has been going on and for me just

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,919
knowing that there are a lot of

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:05,849
businesses around today that are only

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,680
around because Mike little and Matt

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:09,810
Moeller work beside it o do this thing

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,720
and they'll be free the business is

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,460
built literally on top of it because

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,840
there's lots of people from all over the

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,610
world contributing to help make this

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,310
possible and this is the same thing the

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,930
reason that I'm here so I'm going to

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,800
tell you about how we're besties in my

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:31,469
life so a long time ago I found this

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,880
thing called blogging and I had no idea

00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:34,199
what it was it's just you know all the

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,240
cool kids are doing it so I thought

00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,699
maybe I'll do it as well I started off

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,560
using blogger but then I wanted to do

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,909
cool things with the site that I just

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,659
really couldn't do and then I found

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:49,199
WordPress and you know the rest of it

00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:51,120
pretty much history I found out that I

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,150
needed to make a few changes and just

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,860
kind of scratch my own age I meant that

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,050
I was learning things that I could teach

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,949
people who are coming just a few steps

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,719
behind me and then that led me to the

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,780
community as well because I was running

00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:08,460
into issues that I needed to fix so turn

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,099
into the forums asking questions going

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,440
to stack overflow and all the other

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,719
builders are up there help me get

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,949
information and being able to help

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:19,380
others with the problems that they had

00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:20,759
kind of built my confidence to the point

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,740
where I could say you know what maybe

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,870
episode of business maybe I can build

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,789
sites for customers and charge a bit of

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,930
money for it initially I was like oh

00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,139
yeah don't worry I'm not really good at

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,400
this so maybe I'll talk to only a little

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,159
but after a while it got to the point

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,550
where you know this is basically how I

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,130
got through folk over my

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,140
his head the difference between whether

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,390
we lived out in the street under a

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,850
bridge or if we had a roof over our

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:50,770
heads whether we had money to pay for

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,360
the next meal and it didn't matter that

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,240
I was littered I said before that I'm a

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,270
university or I'm from Nigeria Nigeria

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,930
your certificate is a big thing if you

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:03,280
want to get a job as a bank teller just

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,040
you collect money from people you count

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,360
it and you say yes that's cool you need

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,210
a university degree even though you

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,340
don't require a training that are you

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,240
mr. TV gives you to do the job but no

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,710
one's gonna hire you don't have

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,100
university so I was basically

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,530
unemployable for pretty much any job

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,440
yeah so without WordPress I would be

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,770
just a liability unable to do anything

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,940
because I when you fill up forms

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,960
government forms they ask you what is

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,300
the highest level of education you have

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,300
and it's Primary School secondary school

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,490
University a master's degree I'd have to

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,140
say you know high school that's it

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,970
that's that's about as far as I suppose

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:45,820
even though I have pressure professional

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,280
certificates in MCSE from back in the

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,990
day and all that doesn't matter on those

00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,390
forms and no one's gonna gonna employ me

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,880
but nobody cared they had a problem and

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,180
I could help and I get paid for it and

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,210
that was a big deal at some point I was

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,700
wearing my lambo eleven months rent and

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,410
in Nigeria we don't pay rent on a

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,750
monthly basis you pay rent on an annual

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,490
basis so if you were if you're if you

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,530
want to get a new apartment today or new

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,260
house first of all you pink to your

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,930
friend up front and then the expiration

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,230
of those two years you pay one year up

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,540
front every year so I was owing my

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,240
landlord for 11 months which meant men

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,670
let's say we're in 2018 I haven't paid

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,110
him at all for the whole of 2017 I were

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,600
about to get into a new year how would

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,310
you kick me out that that's a small

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:41,140
miracle on its own but being able to

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:45,130
knock out sites for clients in WordPress

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:48,040
helped me be able to pay my rent and

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,959
keep my family you know house and today

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,389
I work for

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:57,399
and this university dropout from Nigeria

00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,689
gets to travel all over the world and

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:05,110
talk to more people like you

00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:07,899
about cool things like this I like this

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:11,589
quote a lot but John Kennedy says the

00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:16,240
right hand-side lifts all boats I feel

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,980
like you don't take anything away you

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,839
don't lose anything by helping on others

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,850
to grow by helping others to shine the

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,920
same way that kind of lighting another

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,100
one doesn't lose anything so I believe

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,540
that we should all jump into the pool

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,459
and help out you don't have to be a

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,170
developer if you speak more than one

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,569
language you can translate if you have

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,339
patience you can teach someone you just

00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,769
need to know a little bit more than they

00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,649
do and that's it you don't have to be

00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:46,600
the authority of listening you can space

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:47,769
for you to contribute I'm just going to

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,269
dump you by saying that open-source has

00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,230
the power to change lives and also maybe

00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,300
the change the world

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,910
so let us embrace the principles of a

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,579
boon to the police in the universal bond

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,110
of sharing that connects all humanity so

00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:01,509
that we can share freely and help others

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,639
for everything we have achieved what

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:05,730
means possible by those who walk before

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,730
us

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,830
