	00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,010
so as you can see using taxonomy to

00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:15,320
speed up your site's I know there's a

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,970
lot of performance talks out there that

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,099
people love basic things like installing

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,920
caching plugins and things you

00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:24,380
definitely shouldn't do that dealing

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,650
with clients a lot the time in my job I

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,080
have to do a lot of code of you and I

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,210
have to do a lot of checks because if I

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,370
don't do my job properly then I'm at

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,320
their psyche attacked or although I've

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,239
done hundred people visit these tend to

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,070
be newspapers that have like thousands

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,320
of people visiting every second or

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,809
minutes and millions and millions of

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,750
page views every week of mine in a year

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:50,570
so to look at things and there's a lot

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,579
of things that they do and it can it

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,370
would work if you're maybe five or ten

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,789
people but even then it doesn't work

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,770
especially well once a page that ideally

00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,390
loads in under half a second according

00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,070
to Google which of these is that than

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,450
done especially into certain things so

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,939
when the main focus is I'm going to talk

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,880
about today is tax on leases typically

00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:16,790
using them the purposes other than what

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,700
people usually use them for so I'm going

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,310
to cover actually creating them this is

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,530
what easier than people think especially

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,750
technically inclined what's difference

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,460
between public and private taxonomy a

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,080
lot of people don't need to know that

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,510
taxonomy so everything examples of how

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,330
to make your sights faster and one

00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,010
particular common example that a lot of

00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,510
people build a certain way that I'm

00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,590
going to show you that much harder to do

00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,860
it excluding things from your homepage

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,900
how to put things in like sliders and

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,979
featured pages and sections in a very

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:59,900
fast way and checkboxes and flags and

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,700
more general covering of the topic so

00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,930
first off if you want to create taxonomy

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,180
you don't need to write the code

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,770
yourself go to this website fill out the

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,619
form and it'll spit out located at the

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,100
end I don't remember the last time i

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,690
typed in register underscore taxonomy or

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,580
register linda's or custom post type and

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,590
then locked us from the codex which

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,170
options I wanted I just went to this

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,810
website checked a few boxes filled in a

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,750
few text boxes they telling it what it

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,820
was called you know what music box and

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,989
then faxes to the plural and I'm a big

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,650
adapter works for me

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,709
and then pasted at the end so this is

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,480
what the website looks like and if you

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,239
see they do a lot of other generators as

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,590
well always work little going around

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,239
things like if you write the plugged in

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,040
handa and you want to comment at the top

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,019
and you don't remember what they call

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,940
which I can never remember myself it'll

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,980
think they'll tell you all the days I'm

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,489
gonna let you just write into a box and

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,830
at the end what they code is see is the

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,300
top of this large chunk of code which

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,420
I'm going to copy paste into

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,510
HBO plugin and I don't need to worry

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,519
about any of that is bleeding easiest

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,110
part of this and it's probably something

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,930
that a lot of people think is very

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,340
complicated but not really you don't

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,250
even need to understand that what just

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:22,660
need to know how to copy paste into it

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,970
so public versus private so most people

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,110
when they deal with taxonomy is bit

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,590
sensitive good things like product

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,390
categories or brands or manufacturers or

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,330
anything that they would organize that

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,910
post-fire and private taxonomy to do the

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,099
same thing but well within having an

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,680
archive page and a nice little menu on

00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:44,980
the side that you visiting my site would

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,010
see instead it's a private taxonomy that

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,310
I might use for internal purposes behind

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,250
the scenes so this is more use of things

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,720
like when you want blue pizza and

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,459
something from underneath the table and

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,340
I wish I had a cake right now

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,410
but it's useful for those kind of things

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,290
awful when you'd there's something that

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,569
you want to do with that isn't that it's

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,819
quite heavy and complex and you want to

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,470
figure things out beforehand and do

00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,940
things behind the scenes but they're not

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,859
the kind of groups you want to share a

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:20,160
customer so this is these are the

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:24,250
options that you would say are knees

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,479
lift your arms so by default tax on

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,700
these when you register the public

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,560
unless you say otherwise and if you say

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:35,050
bowls it will set these three of the

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,180
values wheel all the way around so the

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,999
public is set to false and it won't show

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,089
up on the front engine

00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:44,429
show up in the admin area and you'll

00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:45,929
have this taxonomy but you won't

00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:49,110
necessarily even know it's there just

00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:51,449
looking at user interface and work best

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,989
core itself uses these internally for

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,339
example if you have ever done anything

00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:58,469
with not menus

00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,749
you probably think that's a custom post

00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:04,559
straight behind the similar options when

00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:08,099
actually the then menus themselves by

00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:10,409
custom taxonomy and the individual items

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,269
that you put in like if I had a page and

00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,909
it creates a custom post type of

00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:17,989
nathalie absent and then it figures out

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:20,429
which goes in which menu based on terms

00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:23,610
so a lot of people are completely

00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:26,999
unaware of this and it's people be

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,069
hidden behind the user interface so I

00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:31,229
didn't put leox power farm pipes and

00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,269
templates they shown the front end and

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:36,659
categories is currently our table

00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:44,399
example this is what everybody is used

00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:46,319
to and private nav menu is very useful

00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,509
again these are hidden and they can

00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,399
separate things up by being used behind

00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,469
the scenes and they can also be used for

00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,899
other stuff you can also have private

00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:56,909
acts on these that do have use interface

00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:01,409
but are not on the front end of the site

00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:05,099
for internal purposes for example let's

00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:07,469
say you have things on your site and

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:10,319
there needs to be they need somebody to

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:12,479
go and do them so maybe tasks that we're

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,979
going to do and then in the admin area

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,769
you might have a private taxonomy called

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:22,469
people and then or you might clean it

00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:25,229
who is this assigned to and then type of

00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:27,119
people on individual posts but no one

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,369
outside of do you have ever going to see

00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:32,129
that because it's a private taxonomy

00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:34,079
which has show you right true and

00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,099
everything else set of thoughts so

00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:41,830
that's a practical

00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:44,930
to speed things up so one thing that I

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,780
generally recommend is a utility

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,580
taxonomy because sometimes you have

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,819
things that would be helpful to know in

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,800
advance the querying services but you

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,270
don't want to set a whole taxonomy not

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,370
for them because you know you only

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,280
values in there they're gonna be yes and

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:05,509
no and that's not particularly useful so

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,060
you might have a taxonomy is general

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,220
purpose that you can add random markers

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,389
to so if I'm sorting pre-loaded

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,250
documents I might have a load of dishes

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,319
and stuff that I might you know put a

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,930
red dot and soft topic things that need

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,270
adjusting and then blue dot these that

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,650
need to go up to this department and the

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,360
end of the day before they're all sorted

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,250
all the sticks are killed off anyway but

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,479
I make music with those kind of things

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:35,360
or even like to do noise so I'm gonna

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,840
register a utility tax I mean you know

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,500
call it internal markers I have set it

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:46,219
to not be public but I have set show UI

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,190
in menu and rest to true so I can use

00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:52,190
the rest api of it I can change it in

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,319
the admin interface and it will show up

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:57,169
as a menu but it will not show up on the

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,169
front end so I'll messy over login

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:02,000
no one will ever know this is even there

00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:03,979
and that's all I need to do and for the

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,469
most part you can have more than one of

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:09,110
these taxonomy and all you need to do is

00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:11,840
copy paste and change the word ability

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,450
thing else or change internal markets

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,250
and if you were fronting berg for a

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,200
short while you might see me testing

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:25,370
this is internal market showed up in the

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:28,160
sidebar so hiding post on the homepage

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,650
I'm going to use my utility taxonomy now

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,360
to speed things up but first I'm going

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,790
to go through the way that you usually

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,060
do it and how I might have done it in

00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:41,990
the past so this is the slower rate but

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:44,450
it's a note pad well-trodden so a lot of

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,970
people will create a whole new query

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,740
which will be the main query modified

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:53,300
all they'll do it the better way where

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,640
they filter so what we have here is a

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,550
post meta value and if the post meta

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,890
value is one then to hide it from the

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,770
front page that's how most people do

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,660
these things so here we are we're

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,990
modifying if it's the main query in its

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,600
home then add a meta query where we're

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:15,560
looking for height from homepage and if

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,470
it is not set to true then share it on

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,770
the front end and this is a very

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,390
expensive career expensive because it

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,760
has nothing you always want to be

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,530
curving for what you want you never want

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,390
to query for what you don't want because

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,890
then the database has to sort of figure

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:35,570
out we have all of this stuff here and

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,370
we're gonna have to go through each and

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,190
every single one and pick up the ones

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,380
that satisfy this and then copy it all

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,630
into around new table and then we're

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,370
going to run the query that Tom wants on

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,140
this brand new table and then we're

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,940
going to arrays this table because we

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,940
don't better go back to the original one

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,600
that takes a lot of time and then I'm

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,200
talking about it's a meta query do you

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,329
have a post meta in you

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,550
even as a reason we don't just store tax

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:05,070
on using the post meta because it's slow

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,839
post meta is very fast when you already

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,660
know which post you want and you just

00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,420
want to fetch this particular value it's

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,610
it's built of ice amazingly fast in that

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,940
in fact it's so fast but when you do a

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,949
query that lets say five posts WordPress

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,779
decides to go and fetch all the post

00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:24,300
meta for you in advance because it's so

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,160
fast so if you do get post matter you

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,750
don't end up with a second query to the

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,120
database because it's just fetch them

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,190
all in bulk whereas if you're trying to

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,500
search on that table you're trying to

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,089
figure out you don't know the post ID

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,889
but you do know the key and the value

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:42,060
and you're trying to figure out the

00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:43,860
reverses it's just everything just

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,389
grinds to a halt and it's just like

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,889
snails moving along you don't want that

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:52,470
it's very easy to implement and it's

00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:54,120
kind of thing that immediately comes to

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,550
mind the most developers when they're

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,440
doing this kind of thing so this sort of

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,120
thing is very common and you'll end up

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,529
binge having a metal box in the back

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,390
hands where you'd rather the little

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,699
check box or a custom feel that you're

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:09,180
at and you put the number one order were

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:12,230
true or yes in and then you have an

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:16,949
equivalent of this somewhere that's why

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:19,890
so fast way is to use internal markers

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:22,769
and play show on homepage tag in there

00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:25,380
and at this point now we have something

00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:28,050
we can query for and me always want to

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,910
be querying for what we want it's not

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,279
what we don't want so rather than saying

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,769
show me all the things that don't have

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,779
this post meta is dead where what now

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:39,959
our thing for all of the things that do

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,060
have this tab which is orders of

00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,459
magnitude master sometimes thousands of

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,560
times faster both because we're using a

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,240
taxonomy and because wet

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:54,120
looking for what we want not what we

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:56,250
don't want so it also makes the query a

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,990
lot quicker because it's now so right

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,720
because now it's just one line we just

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,940
say utility shown homepage and we're off

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,950
to the races rather than the matter

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,990
courier which a lot of people find quite

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,120
intimidating because they could go to

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,040
the Codex and figure out which values

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,470
they want here it is just the single

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,810
line a lot of people use tax queries

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,400
sometimes but even then you just have

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,160
you know the name of the taxonomy in the

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,890
term you want just step one is the the

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,420
taxonomy is the key and the value and

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:28,980
that works just fine and this does

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,790
exactly the same thing as the previous

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,330
period so if we go back we just swap

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,770
this the slow query that might cause

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,200
havoc on our database and I've seen

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,690
movies like this bring down servers when

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,330
owns a heavy load all know you can have

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,670
your latest a lot of people visiting to

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,070
this just a single line which is quite

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:53,790
quick and this kind of query you would

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,690
expect to be quite common with us but

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,270
we've got a problem

00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,740
so if we go back here I've just started

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,890
the tag down and you might be thinking

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,080
well I don't want to have to add that to

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,060
every single person I've got that's a

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,660
lot of work whatever negative forgets

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,270
it's who can be asked with that and then

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,550
nobody got time for it so why not

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:18,960
automate the whole process so here I

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:22,410
have whenever I publish a post I set the

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,960
term on that post 19 so that in others

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,060
in taxonomy I have shown homepage and

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,810
now whenever I create a post it will

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,540
automatically add it and if I ever

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,640
wanted to remove it then that post would

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,950
no longer show on the home page because

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,730
I'm going for what I want not what I

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,670
don't want and I knew that time John

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,860
homepage

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:48,700
then clearly I don't want it to show my

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,710
home page so you can use a very similar

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,660
process of galleries and featured areas

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,790
and it's kind of simple as well

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,650
in terms of if I don't want is to show

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,900
no page I just click that little expert

00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:02,200
rather than having to pack round

00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,820
I can't forgot to mention that I didn't

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,710
build that using to place it was just

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,770
handed to me on a silver platter by

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,330
WordPress so I saved myself the time of

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,210
having to build the meta box and

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,820
implemented check box and make sure that

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,710
it was working okay and then test it and

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,340
figure out with things like the whole

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,380
selector

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,110
I didn't have to do any of that work was

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,060
just hunting index I can add other

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,760
things in there just for my own personal

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,230
use this like maybe I really like this

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,700
post and I want to do something like so

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,460
if it's like something in there as well

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,000
and I have absolutely nothing to help do

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,160
with how my website is built or you know

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,860
big E's going to in the future who knows

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:48,040
I have those a lot of flexibility of

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:49,450
this so galleries and featured areas you

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,280
see for example this is the verge to

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,250
tend to have a big section at the top

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,800
with like a nice little mosaic section

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,420
with like their six top stories that

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,760
they really want to push or in this case

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,090
the single story then they really like

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,590
another everybody to read and you might

00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,120
also see things like on the gardening

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,040
where they have nice little sections

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,960
where they can have the sports bit and

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,400
then a big long and then box underneath

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,310
with international

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,760
or here at the very top they've picked

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,650
by Johnson and Russia World Cup to be

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,200
you know their number one story and then

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,270
they you can see they take another post

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,040
and put them around but they curate

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,320
think that they figured out what's

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,730
important for them on that day and

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
decided okay we're going to do that

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,230
rather than just showing things called

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,930
logically so this is a low-level

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,940
importance and curation to that and

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,730
again some people might use post mental

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,089
about but then you have the other

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:49,400
parlament but like for example here we

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:50,990
have Google is by electric for forty

00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,940
million dollars and other sections and

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,070
the TechCrunch website and as you go

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,020
down you see they have their own their

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,720
quantum logical down here your but dig

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,730
and picked at the top so you might be

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,339
thinking well okay I'm gonna write a

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,500
post meta where it's like featured on

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:08,900
home page and I'm gonna search for that

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,310
I'll be bored right and so that client

00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,390
comes around and says okay we have

00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,490
another section called

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,650
acts which also needs it's the same

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,440
things to get are the second post Messer

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,120
and then our third the gadgets in that

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,800
and they're like well we want more than

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,470
one and then suddenly you're ending up

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,750
implementing about twenty check boxes in

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,089
this huge meta box which goes down

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,670
you're scrolling and scrolling and then

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,980
they say they want this and that's he's

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,350
like and then you've got a query for

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,080
them and the query is expensive because

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,620
it's a persuasive query it's just so

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,420
much to manage you if it's just a simple

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,430
thing like on the Apple website they

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,320
have to keep section there but they have

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,089
someone had to go through and pick these

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,500
products and then pick the order and

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:53,570
make sure that they go in the correct

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,790
order and then they might have other

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,560
sections maybe on the iTunes Store where

00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,870
they have a selection of apps right to

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,260
top maybe the top 20 that they picked

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:07,339
but out there with the editor's choice

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,680
who knows so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:10,990
gonna register another

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,480
in fact on me as you can see this is the

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,160
same code as maybe several slides back

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,860
but I've just changed utility in

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,430
internal markers to featured area I

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,350
don't make no other changes but it's

00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:26,320
it's a bit quite useful for the same

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,450
reasons so I'm going to use this and the

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,600
terms in this taxonomy are going to be

00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:35,290
the featured areas so I have a home page

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,700
featured area one for a slider and the

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,100
roads are more this is if you have a

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,560
sliders taxonomy you could have as many

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,510
sliders as you want and you just add as

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,790
many Pat them as and when you needed me

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:51,340
and then just try to place that way so I

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,860
have a top headline section and this is

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,930
how I would do that and then when I'm in

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,440
my back-end area or we just take the top

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,940
headlines in and then they press did

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,190
they appear on the home page in the top

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,100
headline section and the queries lot

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,530
simpler than a lot of other examples and

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,080
other than that it's just standard post

00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:14,320
loop at which point I can go to town or

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,500
whatever slider or layout I want as a

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,380
front-end developer and it's just you

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:25,570
know business as usual it's a much

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:29,560
simpler query as one so you also might

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:34,560
notice that taxonomy they have check

00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:37,810
boxes versus tags so it might be you bet

00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,670
let's say I look at my top headlines

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:44,440
section and they have subsections well

00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,940
that wouldn't necessarily work with that

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,640
interface I showed you earlier with the

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,460
little tags and cross buttons so this is

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,470
where we can kind of then make use of

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,660
categories versus tags in a hierarchical

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:59,170
or non hierarchical where you can have

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:03,040
parents and child turns so it might be

00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:05,410
that instead I have a top-level section

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,149
and that is the headlines of that a nice

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,109
long combination of the

00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:10,299
things that were blank for the

00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:13,509
subcategories because I went through and

00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:16,029
I said okay I'm gonna have a featured

00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:19,960
area it's going to be the top headlines

00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:22,029
and then let's say for the morning and

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,339
the afternoon I have top headlines the

00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:26,799
back and this top headlines is for the

00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:29,799
whole day I can do that by just putting

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,179
things in the subcategories and then it

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,519
shows up in the parent categories

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:38,469
automatically or in this case featured

00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:41,289
areas so aim just set that by setting

00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:42,969
hierarchical to true or false and I can

00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,950
change this in the future or not it

00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:47,739
doesn't really make much difference once

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:50,919
it's like so this is what that looks

00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:53,649
like using my first example of showing

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,179
home page and it's also useful if you

00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,429
have editors and they don't know what

00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,649
the areas are called if you want to use

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,909
the left option it will just show them

00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,889
the lesson if you want to use the right

00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,580
option it will autocomplete as their

00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:08,320
target

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:09,969
I think title I'm using Gutenberg as

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,039
well that these examples but it works

00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:19,210
perfectly fine in the classic editor as

00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:21,399
well so as a recap I coverage generation

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,710
taxon means there's a website for backs

00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:27,549
very handy don't need to write code it's

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,839
just copy-paste few options there's a

00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,899
difference between public and private

00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:33,759
taxonomy a lot of people only use public

00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,659
and don't know about private tax on

00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,859
these you can make sites faster by

00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:40,779
specifying what it is that you're

00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:43,629
looking for bath and what don't want to

00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:45,669
look for and setting it as a tag it

00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:48,309
makes things like putting posts in a

00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:50,589
certain place or finding posts or

00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:53,249
removing things much easier especially

00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:57,290
the hook that automatically sets a turn

00:20:53,249 --> 00:21:00,860
you can change it between cats

00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,750
these times and that will give you some

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:07,070
control over the use interface that you

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:09,800
get and I don't know so I wake up

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,170
automatic and do a lot of co2 per day a

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,430
focus on performance and security and do

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:19,580
a lot of community projects and I work

00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:22,430
at EAP we're hiring so talk to me later

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:24,910
you interested and does anybody have any

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,910
questions

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:32,729
[Applause]

00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,680
I didn't want to edit my slides so this

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,930
is all great when you have a brand new

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,700
website and you doing things but a lot

00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,400
of people already have websites that

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,780
they're maintaining over the long term

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,940
especially but it's even just for my own

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,130
website I might want to make that faster

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:56,480
and I already have all this stuff stored

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:58,670
in post matter for which how do I move

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,260
all the disk top overly it's new good

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,260
new family all this stuff if you already

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,030
have 10,000 posts and then you do this

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,220
and you're like oh well I didn't add

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:09,290
this show on home page turn to the ten

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,980
thousand post earlier now I only applied

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:16,760
15 page there are two of two

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:19,280
alternatives about first just persisting

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:24,410
in post meta doesn't mean you need to

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,600
move it to terms you can it so you

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,270
can add all the dis stop and not use it

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,370
and the premise that let's say in a

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,070
month or twos time once you've gotten up

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,080
stop to showing a home page using that

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,050
mechanism you can do that and that's

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,710
good for things going forward you can

00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:45,380
also make it so that you have a delete

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:48,080
PCI command which you run a single time

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,230
and which queries all the posts I have

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,690
the post meta go smooth may need them go

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,770
to them and making batches of 50 or 100

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,950
and at the term and then it moves the

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,480
post meta and then

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,780
just keep running it until it says is

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,910
nothing left and I know not everybody

00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,730
can do that on their website because

00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:11,340
they don't have the necessary access but

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,100
in those situations a good way of doing

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,840
that is to set it up locally pull all

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,400
the updates it down do it on your own

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,350
computer because you can do anything you

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,310
want your own computer and pull it back

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:26,250
up so I could gonna see like a monolayer

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,810
website because it's a VPS and I had all

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,060
that access but if I was dealing with

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,980
the shared hosting website something

00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,560
that was maybe a pound a month of her

00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,000
and I just wanted it to run fast and I

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,710
wasn't worried about traffic I just

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,800
wanted everything to live in my car's

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,990
involved within 10 or 20 seconds I can

00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,270
download everything running on this

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,520
computer and then send it back up almost

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,740
as if I was doing a migration know me I

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,170
migrating to myself so don't mean to

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,830
change your life that's another option

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:58,740
and Chagas some other things you can do

00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,840
I'd love you told me said questions

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,490
quite literally read my mind because

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,050
might as I was sitting there I was

00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,090
thinking about something I've gotten

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,040
post matter going how will it migrate it

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,180
to you I don't know you clearly just got

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,460
some journaling because you're just on

00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,170
me my first emotion if you were doing

00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,210
something about though so you like

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,460
imagining and savoring a customer that's

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,130
you like much would you have to you have

00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,150
to configure it on yourself like you

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,470
could write your own function or

00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,840
something to actually write the

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,330
migration where you query the post meta

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,890
and then insert it into your so you

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,140
still gonna do not like what yourself

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,690
office vaporize yes so you know tools

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,410
tough migrate data photos that exist in

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,630
the world already

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,790
so you have some advantages in that

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,770
these if you all went away and we're a

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:44,700
command yourself they would all look

00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:48,360
about 95 percent similar basically you

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,600
have a loop the goes round and off the

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,030
query and inside the loop you're just

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,390
like okay grab the post matter

00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:00,290
set the term remove the place matter

00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,000
next and those specifics of which

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,950
post-metal that will depend on what you

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,930
want to call your tax on me what you

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,030
want to call the tags what we were using

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:11,240
the tax for but it's the same kind of

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:13,310
pattern the query itself you can

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,630
probably just take straight on your

00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,430
phone tag website because you've already

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,830
written that query because you wanted to

00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:26,540
fetch those posts in the first place so

00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:28,460
if I go back and I original show on home

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,410
page and I wanted to use that like

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,980
front-end but I needed to write the away

00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,240
command well I've already written the

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,280
command to fetch all that they're up

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,010
here and it's been running on my central

00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,160
world all my existing data so I would

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:48,620
take that query put it in my CLI command

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:51,620
and then use that function there to set

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,210
it so all of the building blocks are

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,130
already there in insightly because you

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,960
build them when you build the site the

00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,490
widgets are you a few extra bits and

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,680
then there's this one throw in command

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:04,000
with children once and then you're done

00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,000
with it you never need to touch it again

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,990
guess what you went to the I was

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,940
wondering how do you tell something you

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,640
don't want to aren't you know you pre

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,810
filled in this showing on their time

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,810
when somebody publishes you guys

00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:29,140
new title yelling cat so it obviously

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:34,300
your last examples where you have Czech

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,950
ones so that makes in Italy Erica

00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,559
because you interface point but at this

00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:42,460
point it's literally just a chrome using

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,470
space on top of the data as long as the

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,450
data stab you you can crayon that's fine

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,679
you could be implement you can say I

00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,870
don't want to show that into place I

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,370
want to build my own in a mess box which

00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,830
is what everybody's doing when they need

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,720
to post meta anyway and you have that

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,910
option that hasn't gone away it's just

00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,670
easier to use the stuff that Paul gives

00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,260
you another question remains a business

00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,880
because you have the underscores there

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,500
you know that's a very technical look to

00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,000
me nine you use faces and stuff to make

00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,870
it more user friendly to that term

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,840
internal markers yeah you can do that

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,970
for the purposes of just examples I just

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,460
set the slogan determining and so

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:22,570
exactly the same but you could go in and

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:26,410
change under the settings because if I

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:29,350
go back to I've set back to public to

00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:31,059
false but show UI is true and I'm one of

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,550
those things it's not just going to show

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:35,320
the little box in the sidebar it's also

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,240
going to show underneath like when you

00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,490
see the main categories in a name tags

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,730
page and the post and you see them all

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,530
listed you get the same interface unless

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,660
you've turned it off but you can turn it

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,820
back on to change things but you can go

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,290
in and edit in you can say okay well

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,140
this is the slope but I mean I have a

00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,030
description and I'm going to add a title

00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,040
and you might want to add with things as

00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,110
well I don't know it's your website so

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,630
you know however you want to use it but

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,130
those are still options so fine point of

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,100
view because help see we'd like to say

00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,680
you know what you know

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:11,390
with the non slow-burning it would look

00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:17,060
more professional so another option you

00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:19,460
could do is them so here I got a term

00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,730
which says chill on the homepage and

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:25,190
then I have this hook which whenever you

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,070
publish a post it adds show on homepage

00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:30,770
to all new posts and I could add another

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:33,590
hook which says okay if shown homepage

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:36,590
has been removed as don't show on

00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:39,080
homepage and I wouldn't want to query

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,690
for those unless I wanted to show a list

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,770
of the piston don't want to show because

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,690
they might be like but they wise

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,420
anticipation on the homepage dude over

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,770
move that okay what's hidden from the

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,890
homepage that would be the situation

00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:54,650
when you never say general post that

00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:56,300
don't have this turn you to instead her

00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,280
either

00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,670
you look as I said before you want to

00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,930
quit the what we want so and sometimes

00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,310
but Louisans

00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,880
I think

00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:10,220
this time you might want to have an a

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,610
overall situation where you ever have

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,530
one term or the other term so that when

00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,720
you want this you paid for this but when

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,730
you don't want this equally for back and

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,210
that's how you win together around that

00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:25,010
in those situations but as a rule of

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:29,390
thumb if you ever have to write the

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:32,240
words not in urdu we're going down a

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:36,110
very slippery poke it's not going to end

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:39,920
well but there are ways around it and

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:45,680
your question to these so we talked

00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:48,950
about 2,000 balls Sao Paulo and post

00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:52,010
meta quoted posts is that they are

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:54,560
slowed the way that they get slower is

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,840
dependent a on the traffic and the

00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,080
server and B on the amount of posting

00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,780
have so it's not a linear progression

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,760
that you double the number post it will

00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,340
get twice as slow instead of kind of

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,100
going a bit like this because the work

00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:13,430
that the Queen has to do every tiny clue

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:16,580
it gets exponentially larger so for

00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:20,630
example the taxonomy tables are built

00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:22,670
for finding things that say I want all X

00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,700
with y anytime you have that kind of

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:28,640
situation use attacks on me so if I'm

00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,440
looking for a category it knows based on

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,450
the tables where it's a lot because it

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,370
we've been told in advance by four

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,110
developers that their indexes we're

00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,150
going to be looking for these kinds of

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,980
things but the post meta table doesn't

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,250
have that so it has to build a new table

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,410
every time if you have five posts you

00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,930
know it's this it's low but it's not

00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:50,180
amazingly slow because it's I mean if I

00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:52,370
post in the table but if I told you I'm

00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,580
going to copy all of your tables over

00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:57,380
and then do a calculation as I'm copying

00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,210
them and then copying them back and

00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,010
destroy what we can think that's quite a

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:04,310
lot of work so when you see people

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:06,740
implementing table upgrade processes

00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,760
tend to be very cautious about speed or

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,770
whether they realize it's happening

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,750
behind the scenes with temporary tables

00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,150
we're never doing it post mentally so

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,550
five posts it'd be a bit slow but it's

00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:20,270
not the end of the world not too much of

00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,860
an issue but a thousand posts it's got

00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,120
to go through and then it's got to do

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,100
the same thing and it does the same

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,050
thing if you're doing a not inquiry or

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,790
if you're ordering randomly because it

00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,400
has to figure that out on the database

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,350
and it's not very good at these things

00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,360
and the indexes aren't set up for that

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,630
so generally avoid it whenever you can

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,850
there are some situations where it's you

00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,620
kind of have to and that's white in

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:45,290
there it's just unavoidable maybe

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,910
because you're writing a CLI command you

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,100
know it's going to be expensive within

00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:51,620
that I have once that's kind of why it's

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:57,200
in there all the various of the reasons

00:31:51,620 --> 00:32:00,500
that but if you can't switch over to a

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,910
taxonomy term the then usually it's a

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,660
sign that there's a trade-off here in a

00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:08,330
way for example then let's say your

00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,030
e-commerce website and people want to be

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:14,600
able to pulse by price let's say I only

00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:16,820
have a budget of 450 pounds and I wanna

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,550
buy a new computer from my mom at that

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:24,590
so okay so let's say Amazon I mean buyer

00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:28,370
or in this case Tom special PC

00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,860
purchasing company and I think I don't

00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,090
want to spend more than 450 side I don't

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,370
want to be showing those products or

00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:37,640
when I thought of them out so I might

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:39,290
put between 200 because I don't want it

00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,070
to be an absolutely terrible computer

00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:46,910
and ordered 50 and then I realized the

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,920
same thing slow because behind the

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,810
scenes it's going okay show me all the

00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,640
posts but they have to have a post meta

00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,350
with a number between this value and

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,400
that colleague has to do all the

00:32:54,350 --> 00:33:01,310
calculations whereas instead if I had at

00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,770
the beginning decided to set up a price

00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,550
taxonomy and Vaman putting in each

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:09,510
individual prices this is

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:12,360
- 99 this is 139 pounds 4 to 5 pounds I

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:16,250
instead said this is what - 5 pounds

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:20,430
this is 5 to 10 this is 20 to 30 this is

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:22,920
32 15 15 200 and set them up in buckets

00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,180
and then put actual precise values in

00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,520
the post matter they're not letting

00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,710
query quickly and I have a little bit of

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:34,950
a trade off by still have that position

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:38,490
for when I need it most of those

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:44,100
costumes and systems are probably using

00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:45,780
weather yeah yeah usually and a lot of

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,820
people who find it quite easy especially

00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,190
with things like a CRM

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,980
it's very easy because it's by default

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,270
and then once day cuz the you know

00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,730
you're going through news saying okay

00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:58,770
this means that that na and the client

00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,390
will need this and this and this and

00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,340
they're all the same Desmet apart at

00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:38,250
fault and then it's usually after the

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:40,560
fact like oh yeah or every page so don't

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,830
do a thousand queries and have 100

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,870
plugins so it is possible with ACF to

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:50,179
use taxonomy the track to tell it to you

00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:50,179
know it's the same a lot of these things

00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:01,790
does any more Russians be time for

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:03,260
another couple you can ask your query

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,430
absolutely query where you did the

00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:16,700
feature although query because I've just

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:20,090
syntax okay so there's a few few changes

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:22,280
here and I like using just the last cue

00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:26,540
but instead of writing the full array I

00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:29,450
use PHP syntax so hence the square

00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:32,300
brackets a lot of the other options

00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:35,480
there are basically pulling from the

00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,130
default so I could I can speed this up a

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,130
little bit further but that would be

00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,600
talking about using the loopy query so

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,940
for example if I tell it that I'm not

00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,550
bothered about sticky post it won't

00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,060
involve a trend begin tomorrow if I tell

00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:51,890
it that I want posts about published it

00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,690
won't try and figure out which post

00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,190
private and can I see them or not and

00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,740
show those it will just show me publish

00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,450
posts which see some more if I set the

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:07,220
author I want that seems a little bit

00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:07,700
but time as well or if I say there's no

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,490
warning

00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,590
again the post type that helps as well

00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,820
so any kind of hints you can give to

00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,490
delete leaked worried about what you

00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,020
want even if it says a deep Bowl usually

00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,030
it's best to give it anyway just to be

00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,400
sure and it saves a little bit of

00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,950
thinking time because you want to do as

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,200
much of that kind of thinking on the PHP

00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,560
side and not have your database doing it

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,990
because you've got a whole PHP process

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,760
to that user doing that request but does

00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,830
that mean one database server one

00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,800
process doing its work and you wanted to

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:42,470
do as little as possible so one of the

00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,630
things but I saw not long ago in the mix

00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:46,580
like with someone who is trying to fetch

00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,130
stuff in the blogging Reaper and the

00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,950
rest api and we wanted to be nice they

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:54,800
wanted to be a friendly API user

00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,300
and only request what they needed and in

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,890
theory that's another nice because you

00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,200
know you're saving bandwidth but we have

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:02,780
tons of bandwidth these days it's CPU

00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,160
and memory that's the problem so the

00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,350
difference between them

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,970
fetching just the two or three fields

00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,100
they want I'm getting a standard

00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,260
response is with the standard response

00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,610
again I can catch the better lake under

00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,170
here and say here you go

00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,000
I have I've been requested this a

00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,220
thousand times the last ten minutes I've

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,390
prepared it in advance whereas the other

00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,370
one where they're like okay here you go

00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,320
over you don't want this icing and I'm

00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,940
going to take two of the candles often

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,160
here and you only want it on a small

00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,510
place here you go in the meantime I'll

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,490
hover the hundred other people are doing

00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,930
the same thing and my hands are full can

00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,660
you wait a little while I'll go to you

00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:38,900
so it's the same with the database you

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,910
could fetch you know the entire post

00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,280
object or you can fetch little bits but

00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,140
if you've got any kind of stuff like an

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,880
object cache it's just easier to catch

00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,910
the whole thing no use something like

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,950
doing peer support network on PHP it's

00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:56,810
the same with stuff like random and I

00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:58,790
find that it's easier to pick a date and

00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:08,090
then pick the first post after that date

00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:09,620
often telling it's much by thinking a

00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,810
little bit in advance about how we're

00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,510
structuring our data because of how we

00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,670
want to use it we're saving ourselves a

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,800
lot of time in the future so that

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,630
decision about whether this post should

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,780
be shown on the home page or not is

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:26,300
happening when the editor puts either A

00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,490
or B rather than every single time the

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,230
home page is loaded and my simple server

00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:33,950
has to go away and figure all of this

00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:40,210
out and that's time that impacts for SEO

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:40,210
and annoys the users and yeah

00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:49,670
I think it was on search safe to see I

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,670
don't know any other questions books

00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:55,890
speak now 40-piece three two on done

00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,830
Hey

00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,830
