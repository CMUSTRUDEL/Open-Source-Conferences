Description: 
	Blogging was always about writing, but in 2018 our readers have less time to consume content and more content to consume.
If you want to continue to reach and grow your audience you’ll need to think beyond words alone. That’s a realisation I had in 2016, it’s one that made me change the way I blogged.
Since then I’ve built stronger relationships with readers, won multiple awards for my blog and added new income streams to my business.
I’m going to show you what I did and how you too can supercharge your blog with audio, video and visual content.
