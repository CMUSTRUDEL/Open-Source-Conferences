Title: Amanda Webb: How to Revitalise your Blog Content for More Exposure and Sales
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	Blogging was always about writing, but in 2018 our readers have less time to consume content and more content to consume.
If you want to continue to reach and grow your audience you’ll need to think beyond words alone. That’s a realisation I had in 2016, it’s one that made me change the way I blogged.
Since then I’ve built stronger relationships with readers, won multiple awards for my blog and added new income streams to my business.
I’m going to show you what I did and how you too can supercharge your blog with audio, video and visual content.

longing for business just like more

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:33,770
blogging for business ok the name of my

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,870
talk was going to be super target how to

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,110
revitalize over all came content for

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,690
more exposure and sales and then I was

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,789
bored raising that title so I came up

00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,300
with the new one it's how I'm winning my

00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:52,370
war and there's this dude the content

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,079
Gremmie same content couple years ago

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,680
I've been blogging for a long time

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,390
before 2009 I was blogging and a couple

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,210
years ago I just said no no no wait wait

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,030
this is probably something you know

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,640
about heavy spinning but I was wasting

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:12,320
my time my business

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,030
this guy content gremlin got to me he

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,079
was sitting on my shoulder and he was

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:21,259
making me say things like blogging is a

00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,270
waste of time he was saying you're not

00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,040
making any salesman really it's just a

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,220
hobby and it's taking up you're working

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,649
week he was saying you do busy to be

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,740
blogging sound familiar somebody

00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:35,720
mentioned impostor syndrome earlier it

00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,030
was a severe case of that so what

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,829
happened was I started losing interest

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,540
so I started blogging a little bit less

00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:45,049
I try and watch the process so I'd

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,719
convinced myself somehow that I was

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:51,860
making money what I waste money wasting

00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:54,770
time and time is money and then I had a

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,799
light bulb moment I had a light bulb

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,740
moment I was like well actually what I

00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,170
need to do is being a little bit more

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,740
strategic about what I do and be able to

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,979
prove to myself I'm not wasting time

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,979
writing blog posts

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:17,700
what at the time we had had a lot of

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,610
visitors coming to my website I had lots

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,590
of content and a lot of good content I'm

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,190
posting a little bit but you know it's

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,010
pretty good

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,260
I had a small NH social media audience

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,830
but I wasn't using it strategically at

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,630
all and that 50,000 people I think it's

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,950
like something like 50% of those people

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,330
were coming to one post on my blog they

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,560
were coming they were reading it and

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,520
they were leaving they would never be

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,140
coming customers and what's worse for

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,450
the bad information but I was terrified

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,360
to take it down because that was half of

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,620
my website traffic right but I knew I

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,800
needed to bite the bullet I knew I

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,990
needed to start being strategic so that

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,230
my blogging with actually I could prove

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,510
that it was working so who wants to know

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,080
how to use your blog content

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,790
strategically okay first things first

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,390
I'm not going to ask you to write any

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,220
new content if you've got a bank of

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,170
content on your blog already you can

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,690
just do these few things and we'll help

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,280
you get there for those of you that are

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,750
starting out in blogging sorry you will

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,940
have to write some content but this is

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,650
the process you can go through at any

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,120
point okay

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:40,520
so firstly what do we want oh sorry I

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:43,380
killed the context for to tell me I

00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,270
should just go I don't know how else I

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,040
can write this but I should just go to a

00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,620
Chamber of Commerce meeting or something

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,010
they're great that's what the content

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,410
rending was okay so what do we want we

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,940
want more than I underwareness we want

00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,130
more people to know about our business

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,750
because unless people know about our

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,900
business they can't buy from this that's

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,030
a fact you know they don't notice we

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,610
want more referrals more people turning

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,860
people to come to us because we are the

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,380
people who know what it's about pirates

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,810
and of course we want more sales because

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,310
that's what drives a business at the end

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,310
of the

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:26,139
how do we get that the biggest foe of

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:31,820
gremlins you might think it's water or

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,660
they were duplicating water sunlight

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,200
okay

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,060
snot snot I'm telling you I know for a

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:43,780
fact that the biggest foe of remedy is

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:47,000
pirates pirates because pirates go our

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,830
and this is my pirate method because I

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,900
just can't be serious for five minutes

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,090
this is my favorite method for getting

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,230
rid of gremlins number one he ordered

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,380
your blog content

00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:03,669
number two you reformulate your blog

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,669
content number three number four number

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:23,350
five so let's go through the number one

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,979
so audit your blog let's hope your blog

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,440
posts there are tools that can help you

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,720
do this I tried screaming flog them and

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,700
I just threw the xcel away and when I

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,380
did it manually because actually I

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,380
needed to go through each individual

00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,340
posts and rank them so I gave the

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,860
ranking scores

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,780
well then related to my business or my

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,979
customer because not every blog post has

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,419
been about your business but it

00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,910
certainly needs to be attracted to your

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:12,530
customer if that's a yes you can give it

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:14,960
one point all thank good how could they

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,450
I wrote them but sometimes you need to

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,700
be a little bit more objective good

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,950
looks very easy

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,350
so it's someone else maybe if you're not

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,980
sure it's good that's another point

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,380
number three then is to decide whether

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,170
if it's not meeting those parameters

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,020
whether you should trash it or whether

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,900
you should rehash it

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:41,140
so to trash a post have a look at it and

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:44,560
decide easy out of date so that post

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,970
that was bringing half of my traffic it

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,030
was out saying it was also bad

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:53,770
information so I had to trash it it was

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,910
gone 25,000 visitors overnight God that

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,800
has to say

00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,580
I'm at the end of I have a happy face I

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,170
didn't buy drinking too much it's the

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,940
content just completely irrelevant to

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,670
anything or maybe it's too technical for

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,920
my reader is it too short it's at 100

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,290
words with a few photos you know that's

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,850
not really going to engage your readers

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,500
but not enough for them to know that

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,210
you're interested and also we know

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,080
search engine wise search engines like

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,550
longer content is it the library I think

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,400
that one a little bit too much like I

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,680
might stay if it does if you've just

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,420
thought it out somebody told you the

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,220
blog post for sir changes healthy a

00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,410
thousand words or actually 1500

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,210
apparently three thousands even better

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:37,450
Michael I'm just going to fill this all

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,980
with rubbish if that's the case traffic

00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,170
it's going to be too much of a rewrite

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,270
to repass think the ones that you can

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,460
keep and just do a little bit of work on

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,950
a ones that are still relevant not out

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,920
of date not bad information actually

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,900
good great advice if you've got a piece

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,750
of great advice and you just really work

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,750
and you're worrying it really badly you

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:03,130
can keep that is it match your idea

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:05,020
reader can it be made if it's too short

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,540
could you make a 500 web blog post out

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,250
of that now that's totally up to you how

00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,170
long you want your blog post to be I

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,240
think 500 words it's long enough to

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,800
engage someone in love with your content

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,770
to remember that they're on your site

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:23,590
and also it's not too long because we

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,850
know people haven't got a big attention

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,610
span they don't want to scroll through

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,580
their phone half an hour skits

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,590
so I think at least 500 words is what

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,550
you're looking for and it's it to the

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,919
point does it say one thing one thing

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,419
that you should take away from reading

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,880
that blog post and that's a big mistake

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:45,420
I think particularly you probably all

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,120
know your stuff here and it's very easy

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,740
just to going to think detail into every

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,829
section of everything you need but for a

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,269
reader that's confusing so try find the

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,589
one thing that you want people to learn

00:08:54,269 --> 00:09:01,019
from the blog post and focus on that so

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:04,940
we're on to step two now we've got the

00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,940
information we need we just need to

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:13,200
reformulate so what do you sell make a

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,360
list of what you sell and I'm not

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
talking about that marketing stuff we

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,110
talked about

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,360
I sell peace of mind I'm actually

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,149
looking for what you actually sell or

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,940
products and services do so make a list

00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:29,250
of books and once you believe in list of

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,899
those you can put them into your content

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,880
buckets you can find your blog posts

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,829
that relate to those different products

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,490
and services and split them up into your

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:43,470
different buckets that picture who's on

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:45,540
the cutting cap and this one team dog

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,440
just my cats would kill me if I said

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,699
anything else okay so truly have been

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,500
making twice today already hello it's a

00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:57,839
great planning tool you can go in there

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,839
and you can mark out your products so

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,839
I've got dogs number one may see cats

00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,760
rabbits have fish and fish so now I just

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,800
need to go and make a little trailer

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,779
card for each of my blog posts that fits

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,269
into those categories and then if I

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,459
don't have enough I can put in some blog

00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:16,110
posts that I need to write when I think

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,279
about Trello she can tag stuff so you

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,470
know which ones you've done and which

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,170
ones need to be worked on and there's a

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,600
really good picture if if it was me and

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,730
my soul pets the cat code would be down

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,990
here the fish column would have nothing

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,370
in so you really need to think about how

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,019
much content you've got for each of

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,970
those and then knock them out

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,730
knock them out into monthly food

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,430
and this really helps you and it helps

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:45,730
you leave it to because when your reader

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,060
sees that you're sharing out or writing

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,450
content every day for a month about cats

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,670
they know your thing is cats right and

00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,520
then next month you do dogs and after a

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,620
while they slowly get into this is what

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,480
the different things that you sell if

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,370
you try to scatter bombing all at once

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,830
this is a post on the dogs one day on

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,630
cats the next people get confused so it

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:10,210
really helps you focus and helps your

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:14,050
audience focus he doesn't have to be a

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:16,150
month you could maybe go a week you

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,980
could do a quarter that's based on

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,540
something or you could do it if you've

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,310
got very few products like maybe you

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,310
could do it on an aura knowledge basis

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,380
set three rehash we identified the posts

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,250
that we wanted to read perhaps even the

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,620
trash or hatch process now we need to

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,570
look at the key things that we can

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,230
improve on the post that we chose to

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,480
rehash is it on brand each your head

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,530
like going to grab attention another big

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,590
problem

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:54,640
I see so many great blogs with the most

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:56,620
ridiculously bad blog titles and nobody

00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,120
is going to click through to read that

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:07,990
blog post if it says cats as the main

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:10,210
title of the blog post or dogs five ways

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,310
your cat will annoy you before it's six

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,500
months old I'm more likely to kick that

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,470
right so headlights are really important

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,250
and do you mean anything and I'm going

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,140
to give you a hint here yes yes every

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,720
time however much you edit something is

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,400
never fully edited I just be rubbish

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,900
everything I used to just give it a

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,360
quick once-over and publish it

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,670
I now spend more time editing when I do

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,800
writing and here's a big more fun

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:39,400
writing editing is so much more fun than

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,890
writing wait so Indian bread your tone

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,900
of voice this is something I don't

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,990
started using in the last six months

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,910
last weekend somebody read one of these

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,520
to me without me telling them while I

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,820
was trying to do if you choose three

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,790
words that represent your brand or your

00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,830
business freedom out stick model will

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,649
will memorize them and just make sure

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,920
that type that ties into everything that

00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:35,680
you write and this isn't an easy

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:37,920
exercise so you don't know and I can't

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:52,270
help that I'm a personal friend

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:54,820
I sell with me right okay visual style

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,550
is also important people can see land on

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,200
your blog and they'll see from the

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,740
layout of the blog from the color scheme

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,620
the fonts in your images everywhere

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,120
the same consistent style that starts

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,690
mimics you even if they don't see the

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,700
logo

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,079
somebody said to me I thought you were

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,100
running a course there on YouTube

00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:18,300
because it is your blue it's not like a

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,300
Pantone color or anything

00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:29,649
but I do consistently use the same color

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,750
so you can use somebody mentioned

00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:33,130
earlier to grab colors as color picker

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,589
tools extensions you can get the

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,820
browser's you can just go if you've only

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:38,529
gotten done you know you can go in and

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,420
do that well you can choose colors and

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:43,060
you can identify the hit coach write

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,850
them down you can use them in almost any

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,020
graphic design tool that you use

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,630
something like handball or whether it's

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,770
like Photoshop and then find a couple of

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,080
fonts that you're going to use

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,180
consistently or

00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,920
places I never know the difference same

00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,970
thing like you know where I talk about

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,649
anyway good eye and then I have a third

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,089
fancy thumb because when I'm doing my

00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:04,290
graphics I want to have something a

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,870
little bit curvy that's not going to

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:10,380
work if I'm an internet browser but for

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,640
a graphic and if you're consistent with

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,100
those things you actually got at least

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,160
put a logo and stuff people just start

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,779
knowing your stuff for headlines my

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,490
favorite headlines do I want to show you

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,700
like as a setter than just the one I use

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,029
all the time it's really catchy name on

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,490
this one we had some mentioned earlier

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:32,670
but this one has a very catchy name it's

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,930
called the a.m. Institute emotional

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:43,800
value headlight generator camera and you

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:46,560
can see pretty looks like it was made in

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,680
the 90s maybe it was but what this does

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,930
is it will evaluate the headlight that

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,540
you put in there for emotional content

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:57,240
we know that people react well to

00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,510
emotional content you know how to put in

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,600
words like crying laughing there's lots

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,430
more emotions than those but if you can

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,260
try and make the headline about some I'd

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,779
notice to be putting the way you you're

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,820
a lot it won't always give you a higher

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,020
score the school you're going for you

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:18,000
put in your title you choose the

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:22,020
industry that you feel empty and your

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,010
gun for it's got a 30% or more 30% is

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:29,670
good 40% is great 50% means you're a

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:32,790
very gifted copywriter I don't

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,250
ultimate 50% so you can gloat if you

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,740
manage to get there I mentioned

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,930
everything I do a lot of editing now so

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,510
basically I just like put my thoughts on

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,709
a page and that takes me about what you

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,480
know the research takes well but I've

00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:47,490
taken about 45 minutes near that

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,699
probably think two hours editing because

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,170
I just blurted out the loading rubbish

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:53,610
but there are some tools that really

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,350
helped me out firstly I'll do all the

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,720
normal things I've read it's really are

00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,000
edit it down help it and then I put it

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,020
into this tool which is called pro

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,730
writing 8 and I go into that turtle

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:10,070
this is rubbish mate get rid of all this

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,450
fluff and it's sometimes hard sometimes

00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,890
you want to argue with if it's just a

00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:21,680
computer programmer it doesn't talk back

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:25,850
so it's confusing and it's hard to be

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,940
perfect writing I'll give you that but

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,530
actually when I do cut out a lot of the

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,100
things it tells me to cut out and I read

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:38,240
it back it's so much a better post now I

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,490
told you about this and what camp TV

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,660
will now know about this don't tell

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,670
anyone else because that's my secret

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:49,100
people keep coming up to me on your

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:53,000
writings got much better provides me I

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:56,180
don't know 77 there I'm happy enough

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,760
with that I still did enough work in

00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,260
that makes it easy to read someone's for

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,100
good I can't do the work

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,020
anyone can do out over repurpose this is

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,180
where you need to create content babies

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,010
so now you've taken all your old clothes

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,700
you decided which ones are going to keep

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,380
you've made them better now how else can

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,300
you make a little content babies out of

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,400
that but we'll push people back into

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,750
your blog that would push your blog

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:26,510
further out to new people what things

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,160
you can do harder now with GDP I almost

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,750
fainted earlier on when they started

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,570
talking about Google Analytics I thought

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,780
I had exported but it's a little bit

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,700
hard melody DPL but create label I think

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:42,800
that series of blockers and I do this

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:45,470
quite often keep it away you cannot

00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,630
under GPL always just give it away and

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,440
use their email address so what I tend

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:53,570
to do is you get back you get an email

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,680
course when you download it and then I

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,230
ask you if you want to join my mailing

00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,770
list after that I think she's not in the

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:04,040
room I think that GDP on compliance

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,540
fines I've managed together but still it

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,970
is a good way to engage someone

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,340
somebody's now got your ebook they have

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,500
realized you approach

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:16,330
in good content does right email

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,530
sequences this is what I was talking

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,750
about now you've got those different

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:23,920
buckets of content could you make the

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:27,760
sequence out though so I have a blogging

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,950
course so you can do I have a inscribed

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,780
series of course you can do so if you

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,580
download my blogging book you also get

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,830
the course if you download I've got a

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,440
freebie fitting some stories you get the

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,900
course and all that is managed to

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,790
sequence out my blog post I've written

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:46,150
on most topics so that they will have

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:48,130
some sort of synergy for a course and

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,450
then of course at the end of that I ask

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:54,550
people if they want to join my mailing

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:56,680
list if they don't my own subscriber you

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:59,410
can do similar with a Facebook Ads

00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,060
funnel I said social a fixation alleging

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,980
Facebook has occasionally I do Twitter

00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:08,650
ads and dying to try YouTube ads if

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:11,680
everyone has tried that same content in

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:15,430
a sequence a funnel that you send out to

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,470
people what's really well all from the

00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:22,810
same content you haven't yet had to

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:25,510
write one blog post and then the little

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,670
of content babies we can make videos

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,840
from our blog posts now I know there's

00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:44,170
not going to be any sound when this no

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:46,180
but I can okay John Murray head shots

00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,460
made it's a tool called bloomin fire you

00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,820
put in your blog link and it will make a

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,680
video from your blogging it has stock

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,420
images that it will use you can change

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,820
the stock images you can change the text

00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,430
he's a photographer so he's uploaded his

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,230
own images but all he's done is taken

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,400
the key points from his blog I don't

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,700
know how it does it may be through

00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,380
subheadings and creates a video for you

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,730
and now you can share that on so I'm

00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,880
really terrified of clicking the next

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,880
one

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:26,860
stress you know which Texas's islands

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,470
have made up their podcast that you

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,870
could do the same with your blog post if

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:35,500
you did a little audio trailer using

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:46,090
this tool weight WAV ve you just put in

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:49,930
the audio so that's another maybe I

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,830
won't play so that's two ways that you

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,200
can push it out

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,450
you could make some images out of quotes

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,190
he quotes from your own blog post now

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,880
this isn't a very good one cause I made

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,460
it but and also really I think square

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:11,650
works better for swear he's kind of all

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:13,720
social networks it kind of works that

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,980
means that you can take the quotes of

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,080
the things they say if you can share

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,250
those out on Instagram pics link and

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,140
share it out on Facebook there's an

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,400
image rather than that and share it on

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,590
Twitter you can share it on Pinterest

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,990
everywhere and it's a new way to drive

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,850
people in and actually stuff like this

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,190
is important because I'm not sure if

00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,870
you're aware of the new Evergreen rules

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,360
about content on Twitter

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,950
they've made it a lot harder for they

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,540
share the same thing over and over again

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,820
so we need to start getting creative

00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,640
about the way we share it so is it's not

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:46,200
exactly the same text we can get away

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,200
with it I'll talk about that more later

00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,190
pop-ups so this is I actually write for

00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,390
a glory post they're going to come up a

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,040
couple of times here you did mention

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,080
that that's my disclaimer they pay me to

00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,000
write for them which means I get to use

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,560
the tool for free but let also means

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,960
they come up in examples because I see

00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,910
there's a lot they those two podcasts

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,580
last year but what I really like about

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,500
this podcast is they didn't just put in

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,010
a transcription because actually I

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,740
really don't like reading transcriptions

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:16,540
because they're usually quite rubbish

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,710
so when they publish a blog post I'd

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,450
like to think this was because it

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,400
maze-like assist the way over there just

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,350
take credit for it they actually write a

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,320
proper blog post to a come here and

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,880
interesting to read blog posts with all

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,290
the ovens in the our site now I don't

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,630
know how that works with accessibility

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,760
point of view how do you feel about that

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,890
but for me I much prefer that and much

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,690
more likely to engage with the blog

00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:42,100
posts and read somebody's transcription

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:48,270
you can use right here which is like the

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:50,740
YouTube PowerPoint presentations and

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:53,980
this you could take those key points

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,630
like he quotes from your blog posts put

00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,670
one on each slide maybe put a nice

00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,110
visual in there and then you've got a

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,420
piece of content you can upload to

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:05,640
SlideShare so I chose owned by LinkedIn

00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:08,710
so it's very easy to integrate as well

00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,990
I'm a bit scared because I did this so

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:26,950
that when I put my mouse over there yeah

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:29,290
totally so you can make a little every

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,900
week I do Facebook live show and I'm a

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,460
little trailer on my Instagram stories

00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,550
about what I'm going to cover this week

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,440
also do this with blog posts pick out

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:41,200
the key things in the blog post on the

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,700
blog this week blah blah blah if you're

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,920
lucky enough to have 10,000 followers

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,290
you can ask them to swipe up if you

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,290
don't have 10,000 followers you can

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,910
number six really ignite your content so

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:02,770
what we've done so far

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:08,770
anyone remember we've audited

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:10,270
we reevaluate it we've rehash and we've

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,040
reformulate it thank you

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,930
and now we're going to reignite the

00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,610
content and this is a problem a lot of

00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,160
bloggers have you write a blog post you

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:21,220
publish it you push it out onto all your

00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,940
social networks and wait and then that's

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,799
it

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:27,460
right on Google great we'll continue to

00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:29,230
get traffic from that I'm not sure using

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,870
I don't even use Pinterest I think my

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,029
traffic so it's still tiny but got a

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,860
result from Pinterest recently so

00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:39,070
definitely whether from a search engine

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,539
point of view but unless you manage to

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,399
rank in those search engines is there

00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,950
isn't it's just sitting there so you

00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:50,799
need to have a plan for reigniting that

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:53,740
content for me sharing that content and

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,389
also you can advertise that content

00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,690
because now you know that that content

00:25:55,389 --> 00:26:00,519
is relating to a specific product you

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:06,759
can build that into that ads funnel that

00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:09,340
I showed you earlier except for he's if

00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,980
we time I set up a Facebook ad I go into

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:14,470
this mad panic oh my god I'm wasting so

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,179
much I'm not wasting money I'm making

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,799
sales rate but they does anyone else

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:27,429
have that thing or is it just me am i

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:29,860
weird okay right okay so you can we

00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:32,500
share your pontiff for free set up a

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,330
reach sharing schedule so whenever I

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,210
write a blog person is really ugly

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:39,070
looking spreadsheet where I categorize

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,110
each blog posts like there's more to it

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,059
than this as the title of the link and

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,620
everything and they will customize each

00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,960
blog post for its really sharing the

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,330
value so if it ever Britain's rate that

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,850
means I can just put it into a loop of

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,860
content I reshare if it sees you know I

00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,080
need to set it up for you know Christmas

00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,799
Easter

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,320
procrastination doing whatever it

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,450
happens to be is it topically if it's

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,179
topical it's probably you know it is

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:07,240
over quite quickly and drive a lot of

00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:09,429
traffic right one it's topical but you

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,929
know in a week's time it's dead still

00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:12,850
like having on your site though because

00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,289
people will look for these for

00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,440
information about these historic events

00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:19,179
have happened and then I had this last

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,279
section which is really actually name

00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:23,889
check for updates and that just means

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,480
before a recession it out again I just

00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:28,690
don't look make sure it's still up to

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,029
date now that I have that I can work out

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,170
how to reshare that couple of tools I

00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:34,720
use

00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,430
first one no my disclaimer about basic

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,750
Oracle's but they actually just launched

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:42,430
a couple of months ago they launched the

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,710
bulk upload tool which they've never had

00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:48,040
before I've used the one on HootSuite

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,380
who's a HootSuite user this is better

00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,370
and I'm not just saying that they pay me

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,000
to blog for them either

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,040
you can add your RSS feed to this and

00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,040
when you're bringing your SSD it drags

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,810
in all your content from your blog every

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,940
single post and you can choose from

00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,130
those which ones you would like to share

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,140
out on social media you can schedule

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,120
them you can change their headlines and

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,160
that's the thing about Twitter it's kind

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,690
of hidden away because I wasn't

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,970
convinced that this when they made the

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,900
change but they actually don't want you

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,070
ever to post the same tweet twice you

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,960
probably all know they don't want you to

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,890
post it to Twitter accounts at the same

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:30,760
time but actually they don't ever want

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:32,920
you to post the same tweet twice if you

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,710
want to fly by the seat of your pants

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,050
thank you I have a schedule that goes

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,790
out like once every month so I'm kind of

00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,230
going well up and I can probably get

00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,420
away with that but there's no guarantee

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,730
so the nice thing about this is you can

00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,620
go in you could edit each headlight to

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,810
make it slightly different each time and

00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,970
then you can schedule it out so I'm

00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,250
totally not with this over still after

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,930
years of using a writable of course I'm

00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,880
still using HootSuite for my bowl of

00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:02,560
scheduling soon as this came out and I

00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:08,500
tried it I quit HootSuite don't tell any

00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:11,230
of this know what you were okay co

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,750
schedule plug-in again this is going to

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,610
be difficult for the new Twitter rules

00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,110
but you can set up you can schedule when

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,790
you write the post you can set up

00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,150
scheduling for let's go out over a

00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:26,320
period of time and then finally we've

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:28,240
got Facebook Likes and waste the money

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,280
apparently according to my gremlin but

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,230
no it no they're not now you've got your

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,080
different buckets of content I use these

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,030
plug-in pixel caffeine it's from a tool

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,060
called espresso that are ironically

00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,690
owned by

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:47,190
and you can actually set up it collect

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:49,410
audiences depending on which categories

00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,060
they visited on your blog again check

00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,920
out the detail complaints on that

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,030
because I before watching that talk

00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:04,800
today I didn't think that's a problem

00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:06,600
I'm not sure now but still there's

00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:16,220
something is that now you can remarket

00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:19,440
to with there we go get evaluated

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,520
because this is the one bit that keeps

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,820
the content

00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,880
gremlin at bay he's not turning up once

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,560
you start doing this stuff so two tools

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,330
that I use regularly I could have gone

00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,210
through hours on Google Analytics but

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:37,020
you know that nobody wants that is UTM

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:38,580
tracking does anyone use that already so

00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,110
for those of you that don't basically

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,630
what you do is you can create a version

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:45,540
of your link that has some special code

00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,360
at the end that tells Google analytic

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,100
exactly where that came from so each

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,650
time I write a blog post I created

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,960
differently for my Facebook page for my

00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,970
facebook group for each of the Facebook

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,320
group that allows me to share content

00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,680
there because some of them have asked me

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,170
to for Twitter for Pinterest

00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,490
my email list for my chat bot I can

00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:09,960
create all these different ones and then

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:13,590
this is the URL builder then when I go

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:16,410
into my Google Analytics I can see where

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:22,680
that traffic people so from here I can

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:25,440
see the end I've got a goal which is my

00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,020
get readers ebook I've shown you but

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,230
goals in a second and I can actually see

00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:33,900
but even though only four links from

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,310
link tree is my inscribing if I only

00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:39,480
brought it from there one of those

00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:41,340
people has downloaded my ebook and I

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,900
don't even link to my ebook from that

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,880
link tree so they've gone to my site

00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,220
they've looked through a few pages and

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,950
they downloaded my ebooks so

00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,820
this is a really valuable full clips

00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,300
from Instagram from one lead that's good

00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,220
huh

00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,890
so that's the sort of information you

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,050
can get just by creating your new set of

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,180
the URL builder from Google that's how

00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,070
you set them up just by setting up that

00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,810
and the Google Analytics goal I can get

00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,300
that information and I can get that for

00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:11,790
every single freebie that I give away

00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,950
and I can get that even if you don't ask

00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:19,290
for an email address and I can get that

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:21,150
for every single product I sell since

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,580
now Google Analytics calls it in your

00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,380
settings goals and you set them up here

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,150
it's a quite straightforward process if

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,310
you google it or if you want a link to

00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:31,380
show you how to do this stuff just drop

00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:35,280
me a DM on Twitter and find a working

00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,930
and I'll find you a link after thumbs up

00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,630
and that is actually the most rushed

00:32:36,930 --> 00:33:00,060
face but most important phase I know I'm

00:32:39,630 --> 00:33:08,970
doing something briefly because from

00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:12,600
that one good news I get more info so I

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:15,570
get two or three referrals a week Austin

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,120
from people I've never heard of and I'm

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:21,450
really bad at remembering names so when

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:24,480
somebody says oh one c'mon yeah yeah and

00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:26,370
then I'll go and google google them and

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,740
be like actually don't know them and

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,270
that has changed since they've changed

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,920
my blog before that I would get me

00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,040
throws but I always know who it's from

00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,800
because people are reading my blog and

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,750
spending more time on my content and I

00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,760
also of course what it's all about at

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,710
the end of the day and making online

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,370
sales and making sales through those

00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,500
referrals

00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:48,070
I've also launched a few products that

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,369
you can only buy online

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,899
and I've made sales for that for the

00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:54,789
slides I've made that page you don't

00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:56,470
you've made really bad pages i couldnt

00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,989
get internet access to anyone it's just

00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,950
got one link on it no you don't need to

00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:02,139
give me an email

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:06,879
i'm not going to even we target you with

00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:08,349
ads no i'm not going to retarget you

00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,149
with that that's where you get my slides

00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:12,010
