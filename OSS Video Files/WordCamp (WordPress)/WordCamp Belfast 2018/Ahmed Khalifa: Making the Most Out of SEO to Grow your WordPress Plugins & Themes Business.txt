Description: 
	When looking at how small WordPress plugins and themes businesses operate, only a small handful of them takes advantage of SEO to grow their business.
It’s tricky though because when you’ve got other things to worry about in your business, it’s not a surprise that SEO is not a major priority. In fact, it can be overwhelming to find out what you need to do…even for me, and I do it for a living.
But can you really grow your business with zero or little traffic? Especially if you are providing plugins and themes, which requires online engagements?
Whether you are new and scaling your business, or you are looking to boost your existing business, it’s time to look at how SEO can be a major investment in your business.
In this talk, we will look at the essential ways you can do that with the help of some actionable tips and strategy which you can apply today.

all right so one thing someone have been

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,940
working this year for a number of years

00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,550
people ask me for SEO and how to get

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,039
lankan how to get booth visibility and

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,300
it kind of obvious that for a lot of

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,460
people organic traffic 10tb in both

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,189
cases one of these top sources of

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,630
traffic and which you know leads to

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,040
another question is how can I get more

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,890
of our or even at the beginning how

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,830
could I get start getting that um people

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,300
focus a lot on Google occupy write and

00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,080
think about Google what are they doing

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,060
what are they doing

00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,120
I'll go and change it all I kind of

00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,700
stuff which is fine but we are kind of

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,550
missing electric when we get to focus on

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,220
Google alone so so let's just get back

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,320
to getting the fundamental done because

00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,390
we kind of get too far ahead sometimes

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,960
but let's get that foundation set and

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,240
then you build on top of it I draw with

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,360
for the last ten years or so working the

00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,409
field it can cover a number of things

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,780
and there's so many words and 38 and

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,079
jarred guns and everything involved net

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,659
yield that are hard to reach out and

00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,060
people can get confused overwhelmed on

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,569
you know you need to learn every single

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,359
thing that you see there and even for me

00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,969
I also get you know kind of overrun with

00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:33,780
that as well and you can go on forever

00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,819
so I guess that's not because it can go

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,229
on more than that as well and not just

00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:41,039
some of the things I have to cover in

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,289
SEO but you don't have to focus on every

00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:45,270
single little thing again let's get back

00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:47,100
to the fundamental because looking at

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,229
that it can make anyone go crazy and

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,780
just get panicking a little bit as well

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,209
so I guess all right let's take a beer

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,759
let's stop let's get back to basics

00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:58,109
relax when I say we're like it's not

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,799
like this guy we're nice take a breather

00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:04,950
and then think about Europe site

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,889
what is Ford and why you're doing it yes

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,720
you want to focus on Google but you have

00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:12,760
to think about the website is really for

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,170
the audience that is who is

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:20,770
nobody else so what I want to do even

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,390
talk about FeO think about how

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,050
everything you do it for the audience

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,610
and also you think about how Google will

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,480
appreciate that I'd wanna explain how

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:33,610
that can happen

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,250
I draw even though it's very kind of PR

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,110
when Google say you know think of your

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,890
encrypt content for the audience all

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,730
that kind of stuff

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:47,260
it's very PR but it's also kind of true

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:49,030
as well - next time so let's get back to

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,100
the fundamental and get started with the

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,070
kind of the most boring one first of all

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,920
is talking about strategies not exciting

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,410
what it is essential we start at the

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,330
beginning what I mean by that a first of

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,680
all really think about your Golden Week

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,320
active you know what do you want to

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,580
accomplish what are your benchmark what

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,680
you want to establish what your

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,290
performance now and what do you expect

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,360
to achieve get really specific

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,530
even revenue goals what are they you

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,840
know you should think about that as well

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,110
and then after that you think about who

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,459
you are up against who your competitors

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,310
what are they doing how they're

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,990
competing what can you do that kind of

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,290
stand out from a crowd I'm not exactly

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:32,850
copy them under you have to kind of keep

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,850
an eye on the market all the time

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,790
important evolve it who are your

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,340
audience are the fifth or about the

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,280
audience get specific who are they

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,380
the demographic the location the age the

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,180
gender the what are the pinpoint what

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,590
problem they haven't all these little

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,450
things are really really important when

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,550
you think about whether you start on

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,260
your website or your Harbor already and

00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,760
you want to build on from there very

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,600
very important and I'm gonna go through

00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,270
the reasons why but one of the thing is

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,280
that I would like to say that if you

00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,890
don't know what you stand for and if you

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,380
don't know who your audience then how do

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,870
you expect Google to know if you don't

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,190
know and that's why you have to think

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,080
back to the fundamental thing about

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,830
think about your audience or not just a

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,810
machine like Google so we have to get

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,930
that basic covered as boring as it

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,930
sounds

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,070
so when we think about your audience you

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,420
think about the communication side and

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:31,190
you have to speak and think like them

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,230
people have asked me what what relevance

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,910
if I have widely should be worried about

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,330
the language that we use and only things

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:43,370
well it had other Evelynn a lot of

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:46,070
relevance to SEO Google one know if the

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,720
way you create your content if it's too

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,970
complicated for your audience the one

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,760
that you have defined and then what the

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,860
one that you know who that either are if

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,440
they don't understand it they are Avenue

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,030
rasa and they leave why Google Google

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,160
kind of Noda and it could be many other

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,850
reasons but if it's a language did not

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,320
something that you need to look at and

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,330
it's the basic things well don't use

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,580
anything in fancy jargon in the C

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,480
language and anything complicated it can

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,270
be human all that kind of stuff it's

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,990
really important and you might argue it

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,680
well okay my content my writing is

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,350
actually very technical or lawyer speak

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,900
or it's very science-based that kind of

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,050
stuff so is technical it complicated for

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,760
all of people but my audience like it if

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,500
does 50 then that's okay because at

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,780
least you know who you audience are and

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,550
you know that they understand what

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,290
you're writing about so if you have to

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,420
speak in our language that the other

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,730
person does not understand unless you're

00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,020
audience but that's okay but just about

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,310
thinking about your audience in the

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:55,910
beginning and Google's initiator so

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:59,390
we'll go back to this section again on

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,640
what SEO could be about unmoored and I

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,350
guess or I'll use an example in my own

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,170
case like I saw let's talk about this

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,870
section cause schema markup something

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,790
might know something might might not and

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,730
I guess so okay let me see if I can

00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:18,020
explain it in different ways what it

00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:21,110
could mean so one of a definition could

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,000
be that it's a structured data use the

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,480
microdata a curious display Rich

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,150
Snippets

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,090
allowed such in ginger and have done the

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,400
pretty the context server and determine

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,110
the relevancy of it and when I say that

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,460
to people like my mother

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,320
why forever even if they give me that

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,850
kind of look and if they're what you

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,030
talking about it doesn't make any sense

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,890
at all wish I could have done that

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,780
because you know if I'm speaking to the

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,910
wrong audience without language then I

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,730
didn't make sense let's try again let's

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,800
try another way the set of codes that

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,920
allows search engine to understand the

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,660
content better the search engine is more

00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,240
relevant display this snippet like the

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,940
reviews and the dates and just to help

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,530
your audience further okay it's not bad

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,480
no but I will get in there getting

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,670
slowly and truly getting there

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,900
but I just thought like let me get you

00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,200
it again make it even more

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,820
understandable right one more time so

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,520
I've called you put on your site so that

00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,050
search engine can understand better so

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,580
you can display snippets like the

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,340
reviews and concert dates and

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,710
publication date further the audience

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,590
get the information they want happy days

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:30,230
even better everyone's celebrating but

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,080
this is the thing that we always do some

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,690
time is that you should not make a

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,770
functions on your audience knowledge and

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:41,180
expertise we need to find out your

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,130
thought you need to do your surveys and

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,230
research that kind of stuff do you know

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:50,780
what do they know and then you adapt to

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:53,180
them not to do so the way I do now is

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,240
all the new Google auto search suggest

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,430
we see not yesterday and it's like kind

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,350
of useful people search like that that

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,720
might be relevant to you Google Trends

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,180
very useful tool is free look at the

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,190
search behavior trends and keyword

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,870
research is also important find out how

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,310
your audience are searching for certain

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:15,080
things it's relevant market research and

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,730
survey start it off you quite useful

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,740
whether you use Survey Monkey a Google

00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,920
Form that kind of thing you understand

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,350
their level of knowledge and expertise

00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,390
under the mom and on test when I explain

00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,920
to my mom what I do it's also full time

00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,440
I could link to her doesn't have a clear

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,410
long time coming so glad you like

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,690
explained it ok Google positions liking

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,370
that kind of stuff the same thing can

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,580
apply to your industry you know if you

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,390
explain to someone that completely out

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,370
of your industry

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,870
then maybe they can understand it better

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:50,490
if you get tweaked a little bit so after

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,620
the audience okay we set the scene on

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,050
your website and every day you can't do

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,029
that you can't get your ranking for that

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,310
website so there are certain things

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:01,140
obviously that one to look at and in

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,180
certain areas that when to focus on

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,260
under some you know the fundamentals are

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:10,320
something like the titles you know you

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,930
URL put your keywords in there absorb

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,880
the main body of text keywords definite

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,120
up keywords make it rich metric relevant

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,820
make it high qualities your subheadings

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,459
is also important if two is three

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,480
when you structure it not just for SEO

00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,820
but we've seen yesterday where

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,579
accessibility is also important to can

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,940
make it scannable and have a structure

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:35,880
and also your images as well that's also

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,769
important and just you know the internal

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,019
links did the URL structure there the

00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:42,779
site speed this is site architecture in

00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,700
terms of how your URL it's like category

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,290
and found name there's so many things

00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,110
that you can do but these are some of

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,480
the things that you should look up and

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,680
what I mean by optimizing images there's

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,570
certain thing that you should focus on

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,940
and you'll see it in the WordPress

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,130
dashboard when you upload the images and

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,839
the main thing that you think about

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,420
first of all the file name make it

00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,880
relevant make a keyword rush make it

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,660
readable if you're using the default one

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,910
says VCU or five one six system JPEG you

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,060
know that doesn't make any sense at all

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,730
to anyone to Google so make sure you do

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,310
that separate the word with - not

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:25,019
underscore that's quite important as

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:27,420
well also the file size very important

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:32,490
it is too heavy then you cite slope and

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:34,589
have obvious with that alt text is for

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,769
me the most important part of image

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:39,870
optimization now the two things about it

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,240
one which again accessibility really

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,519
will useful people can you know when a

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,829
screen reader or see they'll have fast

00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,750
internet they know what is that so be

00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:50,410
descriptive in the alt text so that is

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,980
what Google

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,990
if you understand what you need right at

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,150
this moment I'm Google can't video

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,240
images yet who knows what's going to

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,490
happen but the way I say it you only

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,950
need the alt text how would you describe

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,830
that image to a person who's how to

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:12,070
fight or blind been approximately 15

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:15,090
words 15 characters cancer and just be

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:19,390
descriptive if there's an image of a

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:22,000
white dog running on the field chasing

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,560
the ball they're not your objects you

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,780
know be descriptive like that don't just

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,900
put dog it doesn't really describe

00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,850
anything at all so that's all that's

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,920
really important and then if you have

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,840
those you've got your page title and

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,510
Meta Description very very important as

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,240
well key word in your page title crucial

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:42,010
and it has a bit of a ranking factor

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,960
actually on the page title in the Meta

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,060
Description is useful for it's

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,620
encouraging people to click on your link

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,150
above everyone else that's very very

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,510
important when you have a lot of

00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,980
competition on Google and of course the

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,350
thing with just as well is that the

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,570
whole traffic light system and you they

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,480
say you have to cover all these areas to

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,400
get optimized well the ones who actually

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,350
say is that first of all there is no

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,390
such thing is it perfectly optimized

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,430
page that doesn't exist that's

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:13,030
impossible you do the best that you can

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,710
second of all if you go all green and

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,630
ghost that doesn't guarantee you

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,060
anything in terms of ranking you're not

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:22,380
going to get definitely page one ranking

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,760
position one if you go all about thirdly

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,730
you don't have to get the green bullet

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,010
it's a bit of a myth that you have to

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,870
get it for every single content and I've

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,960
explained about it in another videos and

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,090
a whole other topic as well but even you

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,490
admitted that the whole thing which is

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,350
not green dot bullet whatever you call

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,690
it even they admitted that it's

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,350
indication it's a suggestion it's not

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,730
something that you must do and I do see

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,150
that sometimes people think that they

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:54,040
have an amazing content optimized world

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,420
keyword as well but because they haven't

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,860
got like green below they think that

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,020
they had to change everything change a

00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,700
focus keyword and the kind of mix of

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,830
low-quality

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,060
the end of the day you guys know more

00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,790
about your audience

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,160
then used you know how it should be when

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:13,420
you know how to talk to him more than a

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:16,690
robot technically about so don't just

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,980
keep chasing that green button after the

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,880
whole website seen you have to talk

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:24,550
about your content a the pillar of SEO

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,620
is no diet without content you will not

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,140
like you could do some dodgy stuff but

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,890
still why would you do that because if

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,870
for your audience again content can mean

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,790
many things though because people think

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,040
of content they think of okay blog post

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,630
but not necessarily because it can be a

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,430
text it can be an audio visual images

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,170
videos even for me alcohol you see me

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,390
walking around with this and I've been

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,160
recording all the time that's the type

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,930
of content that you can do as well and

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,790
there's nothing wrong with that and if

00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,800
you break it down even more you can get

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,130
to so many different type of content as

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,110
well it's not just blog post and even

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,080
within a blog but you can even make it

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,510
more of a multimedia different a video

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,520
in there make it engaging because

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:13,720
nowadays we kind of like to have just

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,430
more than text text text so don't just

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,770
focus on only you've got so many

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,980
different things that you can do and you

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,930
never know that one thing might make

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,830
your audience actually love it because

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,080
you have done something that you

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,540
competitor is not doing you just never

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,010
know

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,140
so people always ask me it was like how

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,120
can I find content ideas we've seen an

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,310
example yesterday that you can use the

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,680
author suggests and you get quantum

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,410
ideas get search look at the results and

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,000
below look at the result and can you do

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,920
it better because I always believe that

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,020
you can do it better than your

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,180
competitors is new advisor

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,300
I'll start typing different letters at

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,900
the end and see what you get out of it

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,240
it's never-ending

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,610
another way you can do that is obviously

00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,800
it scroll down to the bottom when you

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,300
search you don't different type of

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,030
search queries in there that people

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,790
search for it's quite viable we've got a

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:08,800
related search query that you never have

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,809
think on it before

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,129
so definitely recommend do not for

00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,259
whatever topic you're looking for and

00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:17,050
then one our apps that you love that

00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,269
very few people know and they don't use

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,730
is use of asterisks and I'll show you an

00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:24,279
example here so if you search for

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,550
example like how to cook rice fine got

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,160
it

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,910
if you put an asterisk in a big there

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,769
you can see highlights more ideas there

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,869
as well

00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:38,619
and you keep on keep on clicking two

00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:40,899
aspects get deeper and deeper and deeper

00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:43,329
get more than each as much as possible

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,309
how to cook rice is very generic but

00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:47,949
works for me very specific

00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:51,489
how can you brother in your industry in

00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:52,899
your kind of content good your audience

00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:56,170
you never know they might want something

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,999
so neat that if you search for dry you

00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,619
could find our answer and then off you

00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,360
go

00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:04,989
so aesthetic is actually really really

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,389
powerful and nobody's una and because

00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:09,220
nobody knows about it and I have talked

00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:11,679
about it two years ago in work and

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,869
office here it is on workers overthrow

00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:17,199
TV but I've also written a writer as

00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:21,759
well there are dozens of ways of taking

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,860
advantage of Google's search hot

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,149
techniques what are we going to call it

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,949
I'm not just using after it's over so

00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,499
I'll put that link in the end of it

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:34,509
slide if you missed it under you can

00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:38,230
check it out but the end of it your

00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:40,299
content you have to have a purpose and

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,999
it needs to do at least one of the

00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:45,490
things to make it work you need to

00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:47,319
entertain and I'll tell you how it may

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,990
be an innocent detain it could be in any

00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:52,509
different format it could be to educate

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,850
this very popular way how to guide kind

00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:56,730
of things nothing wrong with that we can

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,369
combine the two to make it entertainer

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,600
only to inform and it's not just a blog

00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:03,610
post I'm talking about here and talk

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,919
about even the new comic pages the

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,740
product pages inscriptions make sure

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,770
that the coffee of the products that

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,649
you're selling is good it could be

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,480
inspiring to encourage your cup client

00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:18,189
to come to you because they thought that

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,049
is amazing I want that or could be

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,049
another format and also

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,409
you need to do at least one of these

00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:27,850
things because if you're writing for the

00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:29,230
sake of writing well clearly you're not

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,000
really thinking right

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,650
what are your audience looking for and

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,870
you're not having them buy it is

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,820
thinking about yourself only if you're

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,880
doing it for yourself at the journey as

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,710
a journal or a diary or it's private you

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,659
block there fine you can have fun with

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,730
it and go for it it's not longer that at

00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,590
all but if you're looking to kind of

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,289
grow with your audience if you need to

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:54,460
do at least one of these things and

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:56,620
combine them as well next step is

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,679
obviously people think that they forget

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,809
by is the mobile it's so essential now

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,450
and even more attention now because

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,600
Google has said that there are more

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,630
socially mobile than desktop and now

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,070
article was three years ago so you can

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,740
imagine what a of right now it's even

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,649
more popular than the top search because

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:21,690
everyone have it in their hand and then

00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:24,429
on top of that their mobile for indexing

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,250
and what is that Google's going to start

00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:29,830
indexing and ranking your website based

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:33,610
on the content and experience of your

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:36,490
mobile version of your site before was

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,730
always desktop but now consumer behavior

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:42,340
market has changed it for what mobile

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,169
so the basic routing initiative is the

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,740
very basics to make sure it's responsive

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:49,809
and it works on all devices if you have

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,370
that you've got a big chunk of covered

00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,470
if you don't you need to check your

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,909
themes check the rapid repository or

00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:00,279
anywhere else and make sure you get up

00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:02,049
on to fight under if it's not responsive

00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,640
then Google will kind of look I don't

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:06,130
think the audience are not liking that

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,429
experience user experience is one of the

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,350
reason why so good we can be changes so

00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:14,890
it's really important to make it

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,450
responsive active a list so if we talk

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,850
at all about website let's get out of a

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,010
website and see what else can you do

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,049
outside and let's investigate what can

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:27,070
you do outside at all because it's not

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:28,360
just device on your site only if you

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,490
have a local store brick-and-mortar

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,860
office whatever it is it's essential

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,470
what you're on Google my business very

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,360
very central

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:39,740
if you know you missing out and being

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,149
found on Google Maps and we all know and

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,590
we've all done it we walk around with

00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:44,480
our mobile phone looking for something

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,519
like an iPad here you go

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,990
and people will search in Google map for

00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,000
whatever they're looking for restaurant

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,250
for example if you know on there you're

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,080
missing light because if you are on

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,179
there you optimize it you get you

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,580
reviews and everything you get like get

00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:00,440
that visibility and you can kind of

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,450
stand out from everyone else if you have

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,509
for example pubs in Belfast you've got

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,460
lots of option they're competitive but

00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:08,690
if you really work on it then you can

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,759
maybe think about getting lots of leave

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,919
you get all the content in there and

00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,629
make sure that you have all the

00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,460
important information like the phone

00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:20,389
number the the address and everything

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,730
and Google will realise that okay if

00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:25,039
name address and phone number is

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,440
actually the most essential things but

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,289
you can do better than that review is

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,659
essential that can help you with your

00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,730
ranking and that can help you just

00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:36,950
standard over other people in Google

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,259
Maps and if you have fish like that

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,629
then you can kind of dominate pretty

00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:44,090
much names you know half of the first

00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:47,269
page I'm not just from one pub that's

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,549
fine so if you can argue on the left

00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:50,899
hand side you know you got only the road

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,549
but if you have been searching for

00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:55,879
problem verified you can really be

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:58,480
take a half of it yourself and that's

00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,480
with Google my business

00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:04,730
the other thing that people don't think

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,850
about is PR I'll call it like a digital

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,740
PR kind of thing these three websites

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,200
are very very useful if you want to get

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,370
some kind of PR for your site for your

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,620
business and all have different purposes

00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:21,679
it means to connect with journalists and

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,450
writers in different media the one I use

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,149
the most is the bottom on called Herald

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,840
which is done for help a reporter out

00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:32,720
and exactly that a reporter is looking

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,460
for something you have the knife I'm

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,620
basically how that works is when you

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,690
sign up and it's free you fight you sign

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,370
up pick the category that suits you like

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,019
to be about health it could be about

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,269
business Integra

00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:46,190
and there's so many more you get my boy

00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:49,370
at least - you move the day

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:51,980
or people who are saying I'm reporter

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:55,310
I'm a blogger I'm an author looking for

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:58,670
an expert in this topic could you you

00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:01,340
know I need a coat of this amount and if

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:04,090
you have any get back to me and if it's

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,430
really good you can get some really good

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:10,640
mention in high quality PR of media

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,680
publication and if you think about it

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,990
we all know that backlinks are important

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,190
in SEO and if you get deep links in

00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,560
these really high quality media sites

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:24,230
then that's great

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:28,880
another place you can use is gold heart

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:32,120
charge ordinary request now if you go

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,120
and join a request on Twitter you might

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,000
be overwhelmed but this is any such a

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,850
powerful place to be if you are looking

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,200
for someone who what for people who are

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:46,190
looking for someone to provide how quote

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,620
research information about a particular

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,030
topic on Twitter and I'll show you see

00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,500
example when you search for joining

00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,720
requests alone you're gonna get a

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,130
variety of topic it's just a lot of them

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,740
might not be relevant to you baby be

00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,620
specific then you might be useful so for

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,470
example in a request space and also an

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:06,080
example and here is security if you

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,120
could join a request security you have

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,220
people searching their sale I am looking

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,990
for someone who electro insecurity for

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,730
my piece on XYZ and you be surprised

00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,110
about the type of people who would look

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,930
for us and I'm not just talking about

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,690
bloggers and that kind of stuff if

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,810
that's relevant to you we tried

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,580
unconcealed

00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:28,130
in one case the person in the third

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,680
section that the blue tech feed actually

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:34,250
a well-known journalist so why not we

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,460
shot him if you are that person another

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,230
example would be this one but a facebook

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,510
when there have been in a lot of media

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,270
attention some you know someone said I'm

00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:47,510
just 50 someone who did this or that on

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,930
Facebook and if you notice at the top

00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,620
one

00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:53,250
someone from Mashable is looking imagine

00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,419
being free for the mushroom

00:23:53,250 --> 00:24:00,049
really major fourth of youth so wanna be

00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:03,659
shy to them if it's relevant to you and

00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:05,730
another example would be tech a bit

00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,010
broad but the reason I liked it one

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,740
because someone from the BBC is looking

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,720
for someone to help them about this tech

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,280
news very specific but you never know if

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,809
I supply to you nobody shy to them under

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,150
all other hearted you can use like

00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:24,240
blogger requests and PR requests kind of

00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,659
similar principle as well and they were

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,880
kissing

00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:30,090
but Journal crust is for me the most

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,760
popular one also don't forget your local

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,620
paper they are craving for news they are

00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,870
the kind of sometimes when deadlines

00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,360
come dicks sometimes clipped a battle if

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,640
you can have that story if you have a

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:46,350
quick recharge the exactly enough

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,669
announcer but all that within our it all

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,250
good but you need to be what I call

00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:52,110
linkable kind of thing there's some

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,020
limiting something on your site is worth

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,940
linking to if you have you know you have

00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:01,020
any content or haven't moved you know

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:03,150
creative and not helping every then then

00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,370
you know really no junior serve

00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:09,299
injustice so you need to be in trouble

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:11,820
that's why I like to say it really

00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:14,429
important to measure everything that you

00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,340
do not act on Google Analytics and it's

00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,720
very very technical but it's really

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,340
important to measure every single

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,010
activity during a fire and I'm not just

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:26,610
talking about traffic is more true as

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,789
well every website Hoover whoever you

00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,159
are

00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:31,169
has a goal and it doesn't always mean

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,780
revenue a product sale every single

00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:35,730
website article now of course the most

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,330
popular place to charge is obviously

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,890
Google Analytics most people use on the

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,360
way to create goals it's actually very

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,400
simple and machine example how to

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,230
yesterday but there are different type

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,360
of goals you can create you know if the

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,280
destination in duration could be you

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,640
know number pages in weather it could be

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,659
an event like click on play video it

00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,520
doesn't go to you it's not longer and

00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:01,440
more popular one for most days most were

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,220
say his destination an example would be

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,620
if you have a Thank You page

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,179
they make any payment look likely people

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,320
have if that means that they have made

00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:14,240
payment go every referee have a goal did

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,419
not believe fails it can be any deal it

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,140
could be more either order applicable as

00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,970
conversion for your site so if you're

00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,860
not tracking what's working then how do

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,659
you know what's not working and how do

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,710
you know what can you improve really

00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:29,140
important that you should do that as

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:34,760
well

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:36,320
and then testing also very important it

00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,659
might be confusing for some people but

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,299
it is something like worth mentioning

00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:43,760
because I what people focus on by angel

00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,890
increased traffic because of for example

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,380
revenue but sometimes if you test it and

00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,210
maybe get like a few tricks to make

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,669
people convert better that actually

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:55,159
might get your goal get your objective

00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:57,440
more than an increase in traffic and in

00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,080
some cases it's actually easier to do

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,730
then getting more traffic and I'm not

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,010
just you know it's not over the right

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,950
user journey and converting engagement

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:09,559
that also applies to SEO as well because

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,090
Google will know that if a person is on

00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,980
your site they're looking for something

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,510
if they have achieved it they'll get

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,870
that hand and that's why it's important

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,880
for Google as well simple ways is to

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,159
heat map testing is to turn the done

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,630
work before clicking plus on the left

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,850
hand side and also how far that's

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,909
crawling down if you have a big long

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,409
page and if you do it test nobody goes

00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:31,820
to the bottom is there any point having

00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,860
that you know maybe you should think

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,110
about making a shorter put in for

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,710
important information at the top the two

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:43,669
tools that users can do that or hot join

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:46,340
crazy egg another obviously simple

00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:48,200
classic abt F which one it's working if

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,620
you do in veterinary vaccinations be

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:57,350
which wanna convert better I like to use

00:27:51,620 --> 00:28:01,370
VW oh they're quite good for that the

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:03,559
two lat I mean VW is paid hold hot job

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,510
and crazy-eyed have a fever in our trial

00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,220
but you know you don't have to pay for

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,140
them because Google has one version as

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,020
well called Google demise and not free

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,490
they don't have heat map but you can't

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,290
do a bee test in that kind of stuff

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,000
so if you always think about you is not

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,280
and the good thing about it is that it

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,040
kind of integrated with Google Analytics

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,570
and you know that can get you the data

00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,340
that you want all in one place instead

00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,220
of how do you think about a third-party

00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:34,230
tool sinker up API or the kind of thing

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:37,110
is keep it simple after all of that then

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:40,110
just talking there's nothing wrong is

00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,000
going back to your strategy its remind

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,980
yourself what you're doing why Jeunesse

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,170
gets lather rinse and repeat again and

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,450
again and again we optimize you new

00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,890
pages optimize the old try a

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,490
different test what's working what

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,920
doesn't work

00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,380
merge a performance you remember who

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,610
your audience along that way get go back

00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,730
and forth back and forth

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:04,920
is nothing wrong with rechecking your

00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:07,260
strategy swimming all over again people

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,540
get confused when SEO if they buy Oh No

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,890
it can guarantee you traffic avoiding

00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,860
that time but if you don't have any

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,630
value and as I said be linkable then it

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:20,390
was the point because SEO is not about

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:23,430
creating value it exposes our value and

00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,590
you know you should think about that for

00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,900
your audience so for something to

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:33,630
succeed body mass exists not for a lot

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:35,250
difficult whether in mind if your

00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:38,550
product and service is I need to be

00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:42,450
clean poo then your audience is also

00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:45,240
will think that you're flows and then

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:49,340
all of our then Google would think that

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:52,610
you are as another way do you know I

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:55,590
can't use the S word in the camera so

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:58,950
that's important Google will know if you

00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,300
don't have that value then s you cannot

00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,040
do that job for you

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,990
so if don't you have that value in the

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,460
beginning unless you can help you to

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:12,690
expose that but again I always say it's

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,670
all about the audience you all think

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:18,420
about that as well Google but don't

00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:20,570
forget the essential the audience and I

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,840
the best way to start

00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,840
