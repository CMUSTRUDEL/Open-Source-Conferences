okay I'm taking another compliment okay

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,870

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,510
bit about marketing to get a few guys

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,860

objective is and by marketing so it's

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,550
something that can be expensive

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,040
okay my objective today is to go through

00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,860
some of the premium tools that we can

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,770
use can use it and then also what are

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,630
some of the free or cheaper tools that

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,910
we can use to create the invite

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,370
marketing the end by marketing strategy

00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,910
so I run a company basically people come

00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:33,180
to you very simple protocol it's gonna

00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:36,840
make us okay now I have a browser open

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,390
okay I also have the memory of the slice

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,190
what I would like to show you some of

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,680
these some things that if you're not

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,850
aware you could make know though before

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,980
I start

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,090
is anybody in the room using a CRM

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:55,710
system great great great great great

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,900
okay they work it's almost I think it's

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,290
almost impossible to run a business

00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,060
wait one of these things okay now just

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,070
to go through stone with the the

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,690
applications here that we would use and

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,730
we would

00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:12,260
- Amanda the strategy strategies for

00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:16,550
clients now the first one is is this

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,950
thing called play veal no clay veal is

00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,760
an email marketing system anyone has

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,340
anyone heard of this thing no yeah so

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,470
you will have seen it's like guarantee

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,690
you've seen of the loads of times you go

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:33,380
and you buy something and you probably

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,120
up the shopping cart you dab onto the

00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,070
cart before you actually leave you get

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,290
an email saying we got the best point

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,020
you got this product but you left okay

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,720
more than likely Olivia was the product

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,240
that was delivering that email so we

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,270
would use this for email marketing it's

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:54,500
not cheap but you get what you pay for

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:58,310
the next piece of software is get

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:02,690
response now I get response again this

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,850
is very much a CRM system it's cheaper

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,110
than a lot of the other ones use around

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,790
30 quid a month but eliza's today

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,250
lots of lots of things that's a ways of

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:17,120
gathering information about our

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:19,459
customers all right the one that we use

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,040
in the business is this thing called

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,020
sealed source and you're probably you've

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,209
probably heard of Salesforce it is the

00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,550
mother lode okay so if you've got the

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:30,709
budget you really want to try and use

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,930
CEO source where you can actually take

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:36,200
your customers right through the entire

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:40,610
buying journey okay all right mmm just

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,959
working through we as a business we

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:47,420
would adopt sort of a Tony Robbins

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,750
approach toy Robbins is a big fan of

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:54,620
reverse engineering you find a product

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,269
that works you reverse engineered life

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,840
vitamin obviously isn't excluded then I

00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,840
realize them all

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,910
so Tony Robbins is very much into

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,459
reverse engineering hi - hi Dooley

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,769
pedigree reverse engineer a process we

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,440
need to know all the tools those people

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,260
have used

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,959
the website and this is where WordPress

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:21,959
is absolutely perfect for this process

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:25,140
we I have this I think I have bookmarked

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,540
actually and it's called built with calm

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,330
okay if you don't have a good mark book

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,880
market okay basically what built with

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,440
dolls you can put any any website under

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,930
this thing it does not necessarily have

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,450
to be WordPress and it'll give you every

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,610
plug-in everything that was used to that

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,310
construct unsafe there are all their

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,920
versions but a nerve what we applied

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,930
this is the best okay so we look at it

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,730
with a web sites that are good and then

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:56,160
we can copy everything that they've done

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:57,900
okay so under the sister II so I'm

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,040
trying to put on the appending site that

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,600
doesn't have to be WordPress but it

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,220
works particularly good with WordPress

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,010
but if you ever use any of those plugins

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,510
I've actually show you there any one of

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,010
those websites that show you the club

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,830
does agrees that those WordPress site

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:15,810
always quite restrictive and quality

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:17,220
plugins no an order to capture and I

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,140
want to get up to my place right there

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:23,010
just right quickly in order to capture

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,960
the email okay we find this thing is the

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,290
best optinmonster I think we've tried

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,390
them all so you're looking at here

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,310
hundreds of hours of research loads of

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,350
money wasted buying products in at work

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,990
and this is the one that we applying

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,810
does work the pop-up windows the screen

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,940
takeovers all those kind of things

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:47,220
integrating into your Sara okay no I'm

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,540
just getting into my slides unconscious

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,540
the way to fight the

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,810
I'm wall again thermal ceremonies this

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,900

that I'm going to give it at the end but

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,950
according to Michael Dean there James

00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:28,830
Bryan thing we heard Brian thing

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,899

the world he did this survey it was all

by the optimum article or blog is

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,490
between 1,500 and 2,000 words so if it

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,040

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,920

generic searches in Google and see some

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,820
of our clothes come on so and by best

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,649
practice use the buyers persona

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,209
understand the buyers journey create

00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,980
great content left

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,800
leverage the content create great

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,490
content if only somebody talked about

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,010
like so easy now creating the buyer

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,950
persona this will be base and actual

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,110
results not assumptions okay but this is

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,180
where we have to get them to the website

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,150
we have to get them signed up on the

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,800
website then we

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:38,330
sarcasm okay seo seo seo because i came

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,589
to do this well they acted paying any

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,900
money i don't face the guards are

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,450
brilliant but I'm trying to adjust

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,660
potential with the matter now the buyers

00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:50,330
journey so we have three stages guys we

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,310
have the initial awareness stage okay

00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,430
person really doesn't know what they

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,470
want then is a consideration stage okay

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,570
so we've got the ones who are less then

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,270
we've got the decision stage everyone's

00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,990
heard saying that a person needs to see

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,600
your Brian

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,320
seven times before they will make a

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,470
purchase

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,450
okay seven times I'm not as way the

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,600
likes of your remarketing becomes

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:19,820
absolutely key again can be a driven to

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:22,220
get response okay no and by marketing

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,510
guys leveraging your content for

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,460
distribution okay

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,190
what are the things that you're going to

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,380
do to get people to purchase your

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,440
product you're gonna have your website

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:36,890
and your shop was gonna say Shopify we

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,320
jointly WordPress website if one of the

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,980
meetup site I queried was Shopify it was

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:48,920
better than the WordPress I was was

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:52,720
trying to Paul so WordPress is wonderful

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,339
okay so you have your WordPress website

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,650
scalable is just a perfect friend web

00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:59,120
marketing you've got your business blog

00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,810
that you're going to be putting right

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,279
there guys

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:06,050
with those 1500 mm words you're building

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,029
those flows make sure you've internal

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,550
link if an external link to use bullet

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:12,620
point you can picture the correlation is

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:16,910
essentially one picture for every 300

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,529
words and an effective blog okay go on

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,940
ahead over to your landing page that

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,250
you're using it doesn't matter how you

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,100
do it but you have to get them on the

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,930
forum some way a quick call to action I

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,360
don't always make this deviate slightly

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,010
to my own bedrock side at the end and

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,130
like Julia called arts and a Twiggy's

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,709
which has been highly effective and then

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,580
you've got your marketing emails know if

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:43,160
what does in my marketing look like

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:47,630
put our awareness stage or consideration

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,209
stage energy citizens not establishing

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,980
the buyer persona so we're trying to

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,110
identify what this person is actually

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,290
looking for someone goes to Goodwill

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,810
does organic search do we have a piece

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:02,480
of content on our website there is going

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,240
to answer the query the top person has

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,430
put into a Google search so this is

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,620
where your long tail keywords come into

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,050
play and you're generating your content

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,940
based on those long tail keywords so you

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,279
can sure you can one of the guys earlier

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,320
on probably did the google descriptive

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:21,050
search you pretended the letter and then

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,610
you go forward type 'abc so that's

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,399
really good for getting your keywords

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:28,459
and even better source I think is

00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:31,490
YouTube go to youtube guys don't take my

00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:34,430
word for it just click on a word then

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,769
for example looking for Belfast then do

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,050
your a your be your seat your date the

00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:41,720
YouTube results term reason and also we

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,750
get great value have been okay so

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,339
totally all utilize resort what a call

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,560
for keyword research enough for we

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:51,740
because all our long till keyword for

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,610
his song Google Suggest YouTube thing

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,120
okay

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:59,930
another great one is wrapped okay if

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,290
you're not on reddit get on so which

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:06,620
language are sorry this the guy here he

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:09,880
has a potential customer Luke wants to

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:14,149
check his iPhone has a liquid exposure

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,339
indicator okay so basically which

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:20,209
language would look people's likely to

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:23,480
using search whereas the iPhone liquid

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,829
exposure device indicator I'm assuming

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,540
this guy doesn't know what a liquid

00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:29,240
exposure to base indicator is for them

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,550
and is there an iPhone water damage

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,290
indicator pipe to tell if a phone has

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,860
water damage hope you to attack the

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,560
iPhone

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,600
water damage so the answer actually is C

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,070
or not one I probably could work better

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,110
sort of them okay so I did my keyword

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,470
research I have written an article like

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,710
how to tell if a phone has water dollars

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,220
that is my blow

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:56,430
pose that is my video that is my content

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,800
no and by marketing strategies what are

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,560
the things that we create in order to

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,490
get people into our product okay there's

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,700
nothing here but is you know I didn't

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:12,900
think ordinary okay ebooks guys web our

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:15,690
slideshows Tampa's free tutorials a lot

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,540
of the stuff is complex I certainly

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,360
don't know how to create a product down

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,040
okay now some of the tools guys that we

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,500
use I think we use them really

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,020
effectively to create this content

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:31,170
especially the likes of just getting

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,040
downloads for people is come tease you

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,870
okay

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,060
come if you have a product that you

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,010
think you could create a video but I'm

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,980
put it online and leverage that content

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,330
use County as you okay so but I think

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,650
it's got a hundred and fifty cut or

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:48,570
something you can create quizzes you can

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:53,400
get people to sign up together that's a

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:56,520
really super to my the guy that my word

00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,280
which is the king of my marketing is xx

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Rollins okay when you go home this

00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,340
evening go to Tony Robbins website just

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,060
be on his site immerse yourself in the

00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,460
journey of 20 Robbins okay he will have

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,100
about five different strategies on his

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,630
homepage to get your email and you won't

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,180
even know that he's doing it it's

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:21,360
beautiful subtly good for he's using

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Salesforce okay he used this piece of

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,770
information guys like Salesforce and I'm

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,860
being recorded so I hope that I'm right

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,660
if he can activate it if not right

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,250
supposedly the guy that owns CEO force

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,700
CEO sports was not one of twenty

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,140
Robbins's presentations he had been up

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,600
to him on a break and said I've got this

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,640
idea to the CRM think business is cool

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,790
um no work can you advise what I can do

00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,570
20 audiences yes do this is this heat

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,640
coats done

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:51,570
and then the resin historic history

00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,930
isn't yeah absolutely yeah yeah you

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:57,690
probably talked about okay guys end

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,870
point so questions to guide that they

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,270
offer creation okay it's

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,990
offer valuable to your target audience

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:08,510
okay and that'll give your success a

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,850
better chance if there is value so from

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:14,059
a hold back for a second again keyword

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,220
research is so important and identifying

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,199
if someone's looking for it then there

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,900
is a chunk of much greater chance will

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,120
be a success is the offer targeted to

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,510
the right person at the right time

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,130
by just moving on again

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,960
the three stage is what I wanted to

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,030
break a guy little bit more and sort of

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,190
break off these different sizes so the

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,860
initial awareness stage trying to

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,340
educate people about your product okay

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,929

you're going to give them tips and these

00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,160
actually could all be things that they

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,140

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,630
you'll see exactly what I mean

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:22,660
so the conversion path okay so we have

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:25,000
the initial call to action there is a

00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:28,000
landing page we have the Thank You page

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,550
and then sometimes a kickback email this

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,350
is something really does my header where

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,200
the end welcome look at all your own

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,840
contact forms near websites and if you

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,910
have got this don't fix it and it's

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,730
essentially someone goes to your contact

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,190
form 7 they put in their name their

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:48,150
email etc when all you've got is a

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,440
little green box the pops up and says

thanks very much for sending me the

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,630
email not good enough it has to go to an

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,180
other page okay another page that looks

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,760
like a success page on the advantage of

00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:03,580
that as well guys is that you can then

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,590
track that if you have a someone feels

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,690
like to form on your website and then

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:11,230
you've got an actual page that they are

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:13,900
taken to redirect it to you can then use

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,600
your Google Analytics to track how many

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,960
people like to go on a lot page okay so

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,540
it's really important no landing page

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,430
creation clinic a scoop picture there I

00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:30,010

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:37,900
creation humming landing page is very

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:39,520
important for endpoint marketing okay

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,530
it's a way to extract someone's

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,330
attention immediately

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,790
they actually this is pop kettle black

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,070
you go to my website right now we don't

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,110
up the landing page we took it down I'm

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,320
sleep and just at the start of the

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,900
weekend because removing a hosting

00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:00,400
provider so let's go back up again okay

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,740
and to the test drivers also you need to

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,240
design a page that's actionable so I

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,860
want to show you some bombing pages that

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,820
I think

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:11,330
good balls of really optimized landing

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,429
pages the perfect landing pages is

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:18,480
essentially one that can educate the

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:22,260
person you can get their email from them

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:26,309
and keep them on the site KISSmetrics

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:32,640
did an SEO survey and they do one every

00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:35,730
year but the survey for 2007 2016 2017

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,210
two of the me and ranking factors SEO

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,460
ranking factors are number one time on

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,320
site I'm number two click three bids

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,570
okay so when you get to your website

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,000
guys look absolutely certain you've got

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,820
a button the top of your website that

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,970
whenever that person lands on your page

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,980
and you're trying to get them to click

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,179
something I know the problem is that is

00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,910
a button to click then they won't

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,929
scrolled I'm so just a sort of a tax

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,330
thing okay

00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:04,890
but especially the homepage of your

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,830
website on time make sure you've got a

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:11,010
button right at the very top above the

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:14,250

like this

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:41,160
301 redirect so we use the oast premium

00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,929
plugin if just if you have something do

00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,610
something really simple like have a web

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:45,950

then if you haven't on the redirect

00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:53,990
through the page then all the love that

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,700
previous pages gone but I believe it is

00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,500
really important then by marketing

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,210
because one of our clients we built a

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,460
lovely strategy for them and they were

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:03,440
working on absolute rate they were then

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,409
and they read me and their landing pages

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,600
about five of them and they just lost

00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:10,159
everything everything was gone so guys

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,950
just make sure if you're renaming your

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,559

premium plugin will do that

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,669
automatically if nothing to do except

00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:30,080
rhenium the page and it'll do okay write

00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:33,100

Google up there so your page titles okay

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:39,320

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:43,159
their page title type is you've got 70

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,980
characters that can go in there okay the

00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:48,500
actual description itself okay

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,809
you've got up to 300 words they can go

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,700
in there all this is really important to

00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:59,529
your invite marketing strategy to get

00:27:52,700 --> 00:28:02,860
you up the rankings and Google know the

00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:06,649
I'm almost there I'm officials like and

00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:10,940
different types of emails okay that we

00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:13,519
actually send out so we have three types

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,960
three types of email kinds of weeks and

00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,659
those because we're trying to get under

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,659
a buying cycle first one is just an

00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,730
ordinary information email informational

00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:25,760
email second one will be the

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,370
transactional email and then the final

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,500
one that will be dedicated Sands emails

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,840
or certain groups of people that we've

00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:37,010
really coordinated time with them okay

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,679

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:43,960
you something guys that a nice little

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:48,409

so imagine Reddit imagine Rev is

00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:55,039
everyone familiar with the concept of a

00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:55,640
follow of a nofollow link that rings

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,450
well

00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,740
a follow unknown follow mine

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:06,500
basically what that means is a nofollow

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,809
link whenever the search engine spider

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,320
goes to another website and sees your

00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:14,330
site they ultimately are not following

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,429
that link back to your site so the whole

00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:19,040
idea is your study is in the middle

00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:21,080
there's all these sites write it so that

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,090
the matter of the spiders easy site

00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,520
setting around your site they're gonna

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:30,320
follow the links into your site so our

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:33,910
challenge is to get good links something

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:39,290
which is but I think it's quite complex

00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:43,340
no I read it okay the way that relat

00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:46,070
works is that all the links in red are

00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,120
essentially no fault so you go to rather

00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:51,470
you see a story you comment on it okay

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,030
you say oh that's really good story you

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,790
put your link in and that's the link is

00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:59,600
no follow so there is no value in theory

00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:02,750
however if you get three people to put

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,559
the link down it becomes a value there

00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:10,490
comes a follow link okay and let me just

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,470
show you something here okay so this is

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,360
one of the guys we do so that we don't

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,510
family that we've got a new strategy for

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,910
and this is the only thing that I didn't

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:24,380
has website any sales prints prints

00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:29,150
courses Institute so I wrote the article

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:31,940
I put the article into our blog I went

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,790
to read they submitted it to Reddit and

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,370
then I multiply uploads and it's prints

00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:41,000
to digital projects yeah as you can see

00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:42,440
guys I'm here in incognito mode so I

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,270
can't be tricking you into something

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:55,030
here so prints to digital projects are

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,030
managing digital projects on Terry

00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:01,310

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,960
front three managing digital so

00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,980
basically I'm not aware of this with

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,440
lots and lots of people searching

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:10,010
listening like faces and its knowledge

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,020
trade training okay but my company's

00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,510
called big rock designs so what I did

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,340
was I put the article on my website so

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:20,720
the only marketing that I did with that

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:22,610
was I went to read it I put the I find

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,700
somebody and read it who was talking

00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,920

00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,320
