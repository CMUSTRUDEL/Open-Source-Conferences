hi everyone welcome to word come Belfast

00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,139
thank you for coming to my talk instead

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,720
of the super techie debug one and my

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,739
talk is more aimed towards beginners

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,590
today and the reason for that is because

00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:27,710
I work for the support team at 34 xpcom

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:31,460
and one of the most rewarding parts of

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,980
that is speak into these new people new

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,860
customers who are excited to learn about

00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,190
WordPress and will talk them through

00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,810
help them with their websites and give

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,480
them tips on what they can do with it

00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,540
and its really good to see them come

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,500
back a few weeks a few months later and

00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,390
be completely converted into WordPress

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,720
because it's a great platform and we're

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,650
really enthusiastic about it so I just

00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,660
wanted to kind of talk to you guys about

00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,180
the basics of WordPress and help people

00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,220
get started for anyone who might not be

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,590
too sure what they do with WordPress I'm

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,450
hoping that this will give you a bit

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,570
more confidence when using the dashboard

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,729
I'm going to talk through some a couple

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,590
of popular plugins and basically going

00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:21,020
to be doing a talk about the kind of

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,810
thing I do when I set up a website and

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,200
the kind how I use the dashboard the

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,820
places I go the things I set up and yeah

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm gonna try and make it a bit

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,350
interactive as well so if I'm going to

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,960
be changing something on the site and

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,820
I'd appreciate your input so if you

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,130
would like a specific color or something

00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,100
let's try and make the website a little

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,920
hideous because it might be fun but yeah

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,210
let's let's get to it

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:52,340
so I just wanted to talk about why I

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,900
think new people building websites

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,470
should choose WordPress over another

00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:01,939
platform and it's really tempting when

00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,920
you're not to encode it like you might

00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,409
want to go to one of these drag and drop

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,390
style editors something like we blare

00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,280
something where it's really

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,999
straightforward drag and drop you've got

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,609
a website that's really useful but I'd

00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:17,270
always no matter how basic your

00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:19,340
knowledge

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,190
I'd always encourage people to use

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,470
WordPress and the reasons are here and

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,110
with a drag-and-drop builder depending

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,420
where you go and it can be really hard

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,700
to kind of have full control over it you

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,680
can't necessarily move it on to or the

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,810
hosting depending where you get from and

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,430
you're a bit limited in what you can do

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,830
some of the features of drag-and-drop

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,690
builders need to be paid for so if you

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,239
want ecommerce you sometimes need to pay

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,459
a bit extra pretty much anything you

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,000
want to do a wordpress there's a free

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,709
plugin far more or less and to be honest

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,630
even if there's a paid plugin that's

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,799
probably a free version so yeah

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,180
WordPress is awesome

00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:00,080
you've got access to all your code

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:03,549
everything is yours there's ultimate

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,190
freedom with it and it's great and

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:09,290
WordPress can do anything so any type of

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,930
website you can imagine you can create

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,730
with WordPress so you want a shop

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,519
there's a plug-in we commerce really

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,340
popular on a forum social media website

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,040
we you want a website with reviews this

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,070
plug-in specific for that and any kind

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,290
of website you can dream up you can

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,910
create in WordPress and even if there's

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,400
not a plug-in which does the specific

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,890
thing you need it to you can kind of get

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,370
around that with some really unique

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,359
plugins which I'm going to mention some

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,890
plugins which are really good for

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,720
creating any kind of content at the end

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:47,060
of the talk but yeah

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,440
WordPress is awesome so to kind of sell

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,000
you all on WordPress because it's going

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,329
to be real hard to sell a word camp for

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,549
WordPress and I'm going to make a

00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:58,040
website with you guys I've put our

00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:00,440
website up here my rad website called it

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,420
UK and you can visit that now it's just

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,850
got a basic install but we're going to

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,260
have a play with that website and using

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,450
the dashboard I'm going to talk you

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,030
through the dashboard and what I'm going

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,880
to be doing to the site just to kind of

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:18,410
hopefully get across to you is how easy

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,870
it is to use because with the WordPress

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,710
dashboard which this is where I'm going

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,080
to go off into my other screen so this

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,020
is my website I'm going straight into

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,560
the WordPress website as if we've just

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,630
installed

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,550
because most hosting companies will

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,900
install wordpress foyer so you don't

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,840
need to go through the setting up the

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,760
database thing and send it all up

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,620
I thought skip over that because that'd

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,910
be a good ten minutes out of actually

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,490
getting in and getting stuck into

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:50,690
WordPress and the dashboard you're what

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,280
will happen once you set up all

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,850
WordPress website is you'll have a home

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,600
page that looks like this and you'll be

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:01,370
able to log in by going to your website

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,950
slash wp-admin I've got a bit of a

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,550
unique setup so I've got the WP WP admin

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:10,100
but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,960
create some content and go back to my

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,630
slides just as my prompts to show you

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:25,070
what I'm gonna do and yeah we'll use

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:26,450
this to make a website so I'm just going

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,830
to talk you through some of the main

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,270
points of the dashboard so when you log

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,000
into WordPress this can look a little

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,310
bit daunting and this is something we

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,350
get told quite a lot on support if we're

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,750
trying to get someone on on WordPress

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,940
who's really unsure about how to make a

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,260
website they can sometimes log in see

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,200
all this they'll be used to their

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,150
drag-and-drop editor and this can look a

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,150
bit daunting so I'm just gonna talk

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,550
through the main places where I use

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:59,180
WordPress so when you log into WordPress

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,890
you've got your website and you the main

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,110
places you'll be adding content is your

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,510
posts and your pages which we're going

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,880
to go through that Sharla your

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,060
appearance is anything to do with how to

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,169
how your website looks plugins we're

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,590
going to go through and stone some

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:17,960
plugins users you can add users so I've

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,600
got my admin user here if I want to give

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,870
access to someone else I can add a user

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,790
here and they can log in I can give them

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,100
different levels of permissions because

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,500
what in most cases we don't want to

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,210
create too many admins so if someone's

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,820
going to contribute on your blog we'd

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,650
probably set them as an author and we'll

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:41,180
go through tools and settings and just

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,950
explain what they do as well so first

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,260
thing we're going to do is

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,970
change our theme so if I just bring this

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,850
up I've just got the steps on how we're

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,860
gonna do that so we're already logged

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,560
into the site and we'd go to the

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,570
appearance and the theme section to add

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,160
a theme to our site I'm just going to

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,650
pick a nice basic one that we can have a

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,010
bit of a play with so if I go to

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,420
appearance and themes you get a screen

00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,810
like this there's already some themes

00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,070
built in if we want to add a new theme

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,980
we can click the little button at the

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:16,520
top there and we've got access to all

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:18,440
these different themes and what I

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,940
usually do when picking a theme is I

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,300
usually go to the popular section

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,000
because if the popular I kind of assume

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,380
they look good and people are quite good

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,060
at using them and they're quite easy to

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:34,700
use so I'm not going to do anything too

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,640
crazy I'm just going to change from the

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,950
2017 theme to the 2016 theme so it's

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,020
another default WordPress theme you can

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,810
get stuff a bit more exciting and you

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,620
can do things like get a theme specific

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,080
for a portfolio and our website and

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,310
there's ones that are good for like

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,340
classifieds and things like that and

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,950
magazine type themes you just basically

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:03,470
when you go to add new you would type in

00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:05,930
a keyword so something like magazine and

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,090
we get all these cool looking themes but

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,150
and rather than go through a really

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:15,070
complex theme and for a short talk I

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,450
will just have a play with this theme so

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,510
when I install the theme I clicked

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:24,080
install and then activate and then if I

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,910
go back into it apparently things you'll

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,180
see that I've got this theme activated

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:33,260
and if we go to our website I got

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,599
anything there so this thing looks a

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,540
little boring to me so I'm going to have

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,550
a play with it if I click on customize

00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,120
in the top menu here

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,680
or if you go back into your dashboard

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,870
appearance and customize you can find it

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,630
there as well this gives you access to

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,870
change some of the basic appearance of

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,610
your website so let's have a play with

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,040
the colors that Chrome

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:04,440
that looks a bit boring what color shall

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,209
we go for bout yellow yeah why not that

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,029
looks great

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:13,380
pink links ah that's beautiful

00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:15,839
we'll leave the main text can we want it

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,700
to be readable okay we might change that

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,860
in a bit once we decide that we being

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,140
blinded by the bright yellow but yeah

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,839
and the customize is really good for

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,329
thing for like making small edits to

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,920
your theme and depending on the theme

00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,410
you might have a lot more options in

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,870
here so because this is quite a basic

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,790
theme just got these options you've got

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,220
you I can add widgets there which we'll

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,399
talk about can add a background image if

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,450
I want and you can add a header and

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:49,410
let's add a header so if I just bring

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,209
this back here I've got a little assets

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:56,880
folder here which is mostly pictures of

00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:58,529
dogs but if we when going to add a

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,320
header there's an option to just add new

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,380
image and adding images to WordPress is

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,579
super easy because you get given

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,440
wherever you're gonna add images you get

00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,779
given a page like this where you can

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,180
just drag and drop pictures in so I'll

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:16,230
just do that with this one yeah that's

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:20,820
great and then I can crop it I want the

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,769
dog's face is in crop image and there we

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:27,839
go I've got a header on my site that is

00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:29,910
a very blurry image but um there we go

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,149
shall we leave the header in ah do we

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:36,290
want it without a header header okay

00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:37,470
we'll keep the puppy header good choice

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,019
cool

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,269
so this is our website and I know this

00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,649
is a very poor example for the kind of

00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:45,870
website you'd probably want to put out

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:49,410
on the Internet but you can quite

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,420
quickly see how soon you can start

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,320
customizing your WordPress website and

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,380
you can add to your own brand type

00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,690
colors create a header which isn't too

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,630
blurry but you can make this website

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:08,449
your own quite easily with just a few

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,449
basic changes in the appearance section

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:21,430
that's customizing these are more of my

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:24,790
prompts but cool next thing I'm going to

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,550
do is create some pages so I've created

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,620
my website and there's not really much

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,750
in terms of content I want to add some

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,050
pages so I can tell people what my

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,050
website's about and who I am and maybe

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:41,170
add contact forms things like that so to

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,600
do that you'd go back into dashboard and

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,220
you go to the pages section I'll be

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,830
talking about posts and pages and

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,420
shortly about the differences but for

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,870
now I just want to set up a few quick

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,500
pages so I can get menu set up and

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,420
things like that

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,360
and I'll show you how to do that so we

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,550
click on the pages area there's two

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,290
default pages which I'm going to get rid

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,440
of the sample page because I don't need

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,090
that it's heavier here's your gonna be

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:15,070
upset if I delete the privacy page we'll

00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:16,840
leave that in so if I add a new page I'm

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,140
just going to quickly add a few pages

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,110
and what kind of pages would we like I'm

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:27,240
going to add an about page from a

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:31,050
website and this dissonant face here is

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,520
fairly simple to use it's kind of like

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:37,000
editing in a Word document you can add

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:46,270
your headers so about it will already

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:47,980
have a header so and you can see that

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,980
kind of automatically farm up so I

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:55,540
didn't click anything I set the header

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,950
tag here but then I made donor space and

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,500
it automatically reverts to the

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,300
paragraph content and again you can add

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,310
media in the same way you did before you

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,040
can drag and drop into this interface

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,290
and it's really easy to use if you do

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,200
want to have a bit more play there's a

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:14,410
text editor where you can add HTML tags

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,660
and things like that this will all

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,540
change soon when Gutenberg comes out but

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,960
for now this is how we would customize

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,490
our pages and here we've got some

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,850
setting

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,040
we can edit the visibility of our page

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,690
I'm going to make all these public but

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,399
you can have like a password-protected

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,850
section if there's a member login

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,589
section things like that or some sort of

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,589
page which you only want certain people

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:42,750
to be able to visit you can also set a

00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,720
featured image which that's more to do

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,730
with your theme and depending on what

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,709
kind of theme you've got sometimes links

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,690
to pages might have fancy images things

00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:55,200
like that you can set them I'm not going

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,610
to for this example but be aware that

00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,470
you can do some pretty cool stuff with

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,420
featured images as well so it's worth

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,709
setting them and looking at your site

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,740
and seeing what it looks like

00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:07,020
so I'll just publish my about page and

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:15,839
I'm just gonna add a couple more like a

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:20,970
contact page also gonna add a blog page

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:24,899
and I'll show you in a second and home

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:28,200
page cool so I've added a bunch of pages

00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:32,490
here that I'm ready to set up and if I

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,230
look on my website now you'll see that

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:39,740
you can't really see any links to the

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:42,480
pages and if I go over to the slides

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:48,360
that's because we're gonna create a menu

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:51,290
for them so the menu section is for

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,399
creating navigation for your website and

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,959
depending on your theme it might do this

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,850
automatically sometimes once you add a

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,339
page it automatically gets added into a

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,410
menu that's set for the theme but I'm

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,089
gonna create a menu myself because I

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,279
want these links displayed on the site

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:12,270
in a certain order and this is the place

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:17,790
I would go and do that so if I go over

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:20,550
to a parent again and then menus you get

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,640
a page like this and you can also have a

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,170
live preview of it but I personally

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,120
prefer to do it in here I'll just show

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,209
you what the live preview looks like

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,100
menus view our locations create new menu

00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:35,459
we're just going to do that in this page

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,320
so I'm gonna create a menu call it home

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:41,389
menu

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:46,019
I'll call it home nebulous apparently

00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:49,320
how menu and I'm just I created to my

00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,690
menu that's not necessarily the order I

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,360
would want them in so for example I want

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,029
my about page after my home page you can

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,490
add the most so by them so they'll add

00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:01,290
to the navigation you'll have your main

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,649
navigation and maybe some little

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,709
subheadings below them so I'm just gonna

00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:09,269
make these our primary navigation and

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:11,550
then you can select locations of where

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,860
you want your menu to turn up I want it

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,000
to be my primary menu depending on your

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,430
theme you'll have different menu

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,930
locations this this is a lot of this is

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,490
very specific to what theme you will

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,529
choose but you'll have something like

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,529
this where you've got your menu section

00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:29,160
and you can choose locations basically

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:31,980
theme so if I save my menu and go back

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,459
over to my website you'll see now that I

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:39,000
have this section here I have my home

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:42,000
about and blog page now the reason I've

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
created a blog page if we go to the main

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,510
home page here this is where my blog

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,880
posts turn up but I want to show you the

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:56,370
settings section of the site I believe

00:16:50,880 --> 00:17:00,230
is next yes and you can with the

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:03,180
settings menu this is where most of your

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:06,540
core features of your website and main

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,790
settings are held so for example I've

00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:15,110
gone into settings and general here and

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:18,110
I can change the name of my website cool

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,110
word

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,940
so you can change things like that you

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,980
can change the date format for your blog

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,500
post things like that just gonna save

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,870
that the main thing I want it to show

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,429
here which i think is one of this is one

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,559
of the main places I go when I set up a

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:41,779
website because for most websites I

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,210
create I don't like having the blog

00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:46,700
posts on the home page as soon as you go

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:50,120
in some people do it depends on what you

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,190
want your website to be really but what

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,620
I prefer to do is I go to the reading

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,919
section in the settings area and I

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:01,399
always change the homepage display from

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,799
latest posts to a stay page and this is

00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:06,710
why I created that blog page before

00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,710
because now I can set a home page of

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:13,039
home where I can write an introduction

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,490
welcome to my site type thing and posts

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:20,139
I can set to block and if I save that

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,580
and go back over to the website now

00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:24,230
you'll see my home page is blank it

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,139
doesn't have those posts anymore so I

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:30,309
can write an introduction here and if I

00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:32,510
go over to blog my blog will be here and

00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:36,260
subsequent blog posts that we might add

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,809
will be added down here and that's just

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,750
a way I can customize how I how people

00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:44,029
interact with my website because I can

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,510
now put something cool and different in

00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:49,429
my home page just gonna go back to the

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,710
settings area just to talk about some of

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,990
the other options and you can set

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,330
thumbnails for your media I recommend

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,429
not necessarily doing this unless you

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,500
really know what you want from a

00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,419
thumbnail cuz most of these will be

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,309
preset and your theme will take care of

00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:08,240
setting the right thumbnails for your

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:11,210
website so that bit I kind of breeze

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,870
over this is a really good area to be

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,909
aware of your permalinks in WordPress

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:20,299
depending how depending on your setup

00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:22,340
you might have plain permalinks set up

00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:25,010
and what permalinks are is they're just

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,880
the how WordPress writes the structure

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:33,860
of your links so mine was set today in

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,080
name and if I go back over to my site

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:42,410
and go to

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:43,940
yes you'll see hair at the top maybe not

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,260
be able to see it too well but it's got

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,670
the year and the month in the URL in

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,920
permalinks you can change that so I can

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,870
change it to be rather than having the

00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,720
day I can just do post name so it'll be

00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:00,050
my website my rad website could it UK

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,780
slash the name of the post so I'll save

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:06,650
that and it will change that link for me

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:10,010
and yeah that's blue I just know it's

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:12,290
the typo on the homepage name so I'll

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:20,600
fix that because we care a lot about

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:22,370
this website there we go cool so yeah

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,800
the settings menu is where you can edit

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,780
most of the important parts of your

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,590
website and how people interact with it

00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,720
and how they read your blog and it's

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,090
really Honda so it's worth having a play

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,520
around in there and just be aware of

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,140
changing URLs in the general section

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,970
because if you're not too sure what

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,940
you're doing you can make the website go

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,950
down so it is worth being a little

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,270
careful in that area it's the only area

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,230
in the dashboard where you can really

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,430
cause a massive problem but the options

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,260
I've shown you through are perfectly

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:58,340
fine to change to whatever you've likely

00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:01,670
to do next I'm going to show you

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:04,610
creating posts let's go back to that

00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,260
actually because I'm just going to talk

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:10,520
about the difference between a post and

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:12,790
a page and because in a lot of ways

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,170
they're very much the same thing but

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:18,920
WordPress has different options for

00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:21,110
posts and pages and posts when you post

00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,180
them they're more in a blog style farmer

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,400
so they'll have a date assigned to them

00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,160
and you'll be able to organize them by

00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,670
categories and tags and things like that

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:34,910
pages and the pages I created before

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:37,400
more for main content which stays the

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,230
same you can update it and put things

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,840
that you want people to be able to

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,880
easily access on the home page you can

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,890
create a page for and it's staged

00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,940
doesn't have a day won't get bumped down

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:54,680
when you create more pages and yeah

00:21:49,940 --> 00:22:00,430
that's kind of the difficult so I'm

00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:04,340
gonna create a post so I go to posts I

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:07,010
will add a new post and I have a little

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:14,390
post here which I stole off my own blog

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:16,550
and it's about another word camp and it

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:19,580
was about my I think this one was about

00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:23,810
word camp London yeah what come London

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:26,270
woohoo and I can paste that in and you

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:30,560
can see the kind of things I can change

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:33,710
here and assign to this and blog post so

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:37,370
I can add categories so I could have a

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:45,110
category for word camps I could have a

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:46,580
category for tutorials maybe but I

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,290
wouldn't necessarily add this as a

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,090
tutorial this is more me just talking

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,280
about a word camp this post so I'd

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,230
assign it to that category and then I

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,930
can add tags and this is good for your

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,450
SEO if you want to turn up on Google you

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,160
want to set some good tags and it helps

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,220
people find your content on your site

00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:08,600
when you search in so I can add would

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:10,520
come as a tag what pou with commas you

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,130
don't need to do a space if you add them

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,590
it'll separate them like that so you can

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:19,130
create your tags like that and you can

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,500
set a featured image again which will

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,690
come up nicely on your page shall we set

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,140
a featured image

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:29,780
let's use our dog picture from before

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,300
publish that and let's have a look what

00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,600
that looks like so back to my home page

00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,520
blog section and you'll see this would

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,270
come London Post has my featured image

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,110
there my post content there and I also

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:47,450
have my categories and tags here and

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:49,610
below that is my previous blog post and

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,390
that's just kind of how the posts work

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:55,940
they just bump down from the top like

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,460
you would expect a blog to do and that's

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,160
how they differ from pages which estate

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,070
content you don't add any ones behind

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,750
they're just

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:09,840
given the five-minute mark so I'm gonna

00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:12,420
speed up a bit plugins plugins unlock

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,000
the true power of WordPress and when you

00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,770
add a plug-in to your website and you're

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,370
adding little bits of code that

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,810
someone's created and you can this is

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,000
where you can really customize your

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,980
WordPress website to do whatever you

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,900
want it to do I was going to go through

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,080
two but since we push the time I'm just

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,060
going to talk about Yost and Yoast is

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,910
one of the popular plugins I am going to

00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:39,300
cover and it's a plug-in which basically

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:43,350
adds some basic SEO for your site and

00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:46,320
I'm not an SEO expert but Yoast really

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,420
helps my website come up on Google and

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,000
it's because it's so easy to use so I'm

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:55,940
just going to give you an example of

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,280
installing that so plugins add new and

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:03,300
to add a plug-in you just search in this

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:08,010
area so I'm gonna do Yoast which keeps

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:11,630
trying to correct a toast so I'm going

00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,630
to install some toast or more website

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,270
activate that and depending on the

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,910
plugin you get it might not be clear

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,890
what it does straight away good places

00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,560
to look for what our plugin does is on

00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,420
your plugin section you can do a view

00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,810
details there which will give you links

00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,790
to the page where Yoast is featured on

00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,500
the wordpress.org site and it usually

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,090
has some documentation so if you're not

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,860
too sure what your plug-in does when you

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,300
activate it you can usually find

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,910
something that helpful information that

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,380
you're just pretty straightforward in

00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,240
terms of where you can go because you

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,470
can go in settings and set some basic

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:52,230
SEO settings but the main thing I use

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,830
Yoast far if we go back over to my word

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,990
cut London Post which I just created

00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:00,600
what your stores is it adds this section

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:04,440
below the post content it adds this

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:07,980
section here and this helps you make

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,020
your your pages more SEO friendly so it

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,560
asks you to set a focus keyword which

00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:15,350
I'm gonna put as word camp for the sake

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,510
of this example

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,419
and you might have noticed when I set

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:23,059
that keyword word this light turned

00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:25,580
green and that's what your so it's all

00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:28,100
about getting this green light if you

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,960
don't have a green light there you've

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,570
got this feedback here about your post

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,990
so it's got problems with your SEO

00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:38,299
things you can improve on some more

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,490
improvements there these are the bigger

00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:43,340
things to do these are just some minor

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,780
improvements and these are things that

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,080
are good about your post so it gives you

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,120
feedback on your post about what is what

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,730
they think is good for your SEO and what

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,860
is not so good and you can kind of edit

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,440
your post until all these flash green

00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:00,980
and you'll have a pretty SEO friendly

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,409
page and if it doesn't come up first

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,659
ranking on Google it's not necessarily

00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:08,240
and that might be the point where you

00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:12,710
want an SEO expert because because I'm

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,320
not an SEO expert I use Yoast and does a

00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:18,559
nice job farmer makes my pages kind of

00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,659
turn up on Google I get some comments

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,370
sometimes and but yeah that's how us

00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:26,150
works

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:29,960
you can also set extra keywords and this

00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:32,510
premium options you can set things for

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,970
social media so you can use Facebook and

00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:40,000
Twitter to put your page up on there and

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:42,799
yeah Yoast is really handy for that

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,260
another popular plug-in was contact form

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,520
7 which what contact form 7 does I'm

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:51,350

00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:57,020

dashboard you click on that section it

contact form 7 install today ok and that

is called a shark tag and lots of

00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:51,740
plugins create shark tags and what they

00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:54,830
do is you can just drag and drop content

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:57,200
into your pages so the contact page I

00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:00,980
created before I can just drop that

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,740
contact shark code in and it does this

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,679
to my page add this really cool contact

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,129
form and how easy was that this is why

00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,570
plugins are awesome because I didn't

00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:16,820
want to code that that would have been

00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:19,850
painful and just a few tips on choosing

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,279
a good plug-in and somewhat we get asked

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,929
on support a lot is how can I be sure

00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:26,000
that this plug-in is good this plug-in

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,730
is safe because anyone can submit a

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,070
plug-in to the WordPress repository what

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:34,159
I usually do to reassure them is remind

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,200
them that anything you install through

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,480
the plug-in repository so within your

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,309
WordPress installation that plug-in

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,960
would not be there if it's not been

00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:44,269
approved by someone from the

00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,769
wordpress.org plug-in to you they check

00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:49,759
through the code make sure it's safe

00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:51,620
make sure that actually works and yeah

00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,679
just a few other things to check out

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,200
it's number of downloads Starion and we

00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,720
also out so it first p.m. have made our

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:04,309
own plug-in called WP fingerprint and

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,889
that check sums your plugin so why it

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:09,470
does it it looks at the it looks at the

00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:12,200
plugin file on your computer on your

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,029
website rather and it compares it to the

00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,399
plugin in the repository to make sure

00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:18,320
the files match and it's a way of making

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,139
sure your plug-in is not compromised not

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,019
hacked it's completely safe and yeah

00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:25,730
that's just a way we try and keep on top

00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:28,580
and make sure that people have safe

00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:30,200
plugins on our hosting and so feel free

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,440
to check that out on the plug-in

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,360
repository if you'd like to and I'll

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,220
skip over medium galleries because we're

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:42,170
them and some extra homework fires and

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,210
because I've gone through some of the

00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:47,210
real basics on creating and how to use

00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:49,370
the dashboard and some things I would

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,010
recommend beginners take a look at is

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,350
the jetpack plug-in because it's really

00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:56,120
good for beginners it's a plug-in with a

00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,950
lot of different features in it you

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,980
install it and you can tick things like

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,830
add a contact form add links to Facebook

00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,380
and automatically post off it's really

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,080
useful so jetpacks definitely a good

00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,460
plugin for beginners to look at talk to

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,559
your hosting about getting an SSL

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,500
certificate if you have a contact form

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,140
or any kind of data that you need

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,090
protection get an SSL certificate so

00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,490
it's all encrypted keeps your website

00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,620
safe definitely look at that and if you

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,480
want to be a bit more advanced take a

00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,549
look at the custom post types plug-in

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,860
because it'll really help you understand

00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:32,900
the difference between posts pages and

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,790
you can create really unique content

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,559
with it it's a bit more of an advanced

00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,510
plug-in but when you when you're

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,520
comfortable with the dashboard check

00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:44,600
that one out because you'll learn so

00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,429
much more from it and yeah and hopefully

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,230
people found this helpful I tried to

00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:50,740
refer you at the end there and but yeah

00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,740
