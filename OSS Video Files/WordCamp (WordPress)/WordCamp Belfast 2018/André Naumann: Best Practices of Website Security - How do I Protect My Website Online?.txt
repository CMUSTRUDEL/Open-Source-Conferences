	00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:10,769
part of my job is to help webmasters

00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,090
create fast and secure websites and

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,040
actually it's my very first work camp

00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:19,989
and I'm really excited to be here

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,450
so yeah let's jump in today we are going

00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:23,950
to look at two things first I'm going to

00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,880
talk about why website security is

00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,550
important and what common misconceptions

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,370
exists about how and why websites are

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,020
being attacked and second I will

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,430
introduce six best practices that we

00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:42,580
think would help site owners to improve

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,250
but security and I hope we will select

00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,600
time for Q&A if there's one thing I

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,880
would like to take away from this

00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,800
session then it is this make website

00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,030
security priority by adopting the best

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,550
practices let's start let's start with

00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:02,680
an easy question why is making your site

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,579
important in order to answer it let's

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,229
look at some of the common

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,960
misconceptions about how and why

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,060
websites are being attacked the first

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,850
one is this security is not a

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,159
developer's job and you might think as a

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,220
developer I'm interested in the lighting

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,880
users by creating a fast and reliable

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,810
web experience but what about

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,820
applications or sites which are not

00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,220
secure and get compromised well

00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,229
essentially it will hurt the users and

00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,150
their trust

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,650
therefore as a developer you should

00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,799
probably be thinking about security as

00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,290
well the second misconception that we

00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,659
often encounter is how sites are

00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,770
actually being attacked site owners

00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:43,630
believe that their sites are being

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,960
singled out and I can be targeted by

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,670
hackers

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,159
for example sitting in a basement and

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,200
guessing passwords in reality hackers

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,080
try to exploit systemic vulnerabilities

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,479
of CMS that forms plugins and

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,200
third-party applications for example

00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,280
outdated or unpatched versions I'm

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,080
important here is that it's not

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,530
necessarily your business or even your

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,579
site that becomes the target but just a

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,079
piece of software that runs on your site

00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:12,790
the third one is related to the why

00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:15,549
sites are being attacked

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,709
this is honest thing that hey if I don't

00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:20,140
store or process any personal data on my

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,920
site then it's very unlikely that my

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,329
site gets targeted now think of a site

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,920
that belongs to an apple to an ice cream

00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:32,620
store and it contains only basic

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,650
information about ingredients or opening

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,810
times or directions however it drinks

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,909
really well on search because it happens

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,079
to be the most popular place in town an

00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:44,889
attacker might be interested in

00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:49,450
exploiting this reputation of the site

00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:51,730
by monetizing the traffic to the site so

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,099
what can we conclude security should be

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,859
an essential part of a great web

00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,180
experience second a site is not

00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:01,989
necessarily the main target of an attack

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:07,780
and it's the technical signals rather

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:10,480
than the business that matter think of

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,900
it this way a burglar works up and down

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,879
the street and knocks on every door and

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,739
when the door opens they try to

00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,870
understand what's inside the house and

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,970
before the end of the house they don't

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,019
even know if stuff that's in the house

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,609
is valuable or not in today's world this

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,879
work is done by computer programs and

00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:34,449
your house might be the site your site

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,040
and if you don't lock don't lock it you

00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,979
can see what happens if you don't lock

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,930
it in this example I guess some of you

00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:45,639
heard of this case it's a us-based

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,510
company which I'm just personal data

00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:51,220
like tax IDs emails and other personal

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:57,040
information for millions of US citizens

00:03:51,220 --> 00:04:00,040
and ironically it was hacked and data of

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,150
roughly 133 million users was exposed

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:07,780
why do I show you this example well it's

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,159
even the best make mistakes but now you

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,180
might think well of course they get

00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:15,129
hacked they manage valuable data here's

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,370
the example that we see every day

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:21,669
the Japanese key word hack targets sites

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,229
with good reputation on search the way

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,650
it works is that new pages are being

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:28,020
create

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:30,880
it with auto-generated Japanese text in

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,990
randomly generated direct directories

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:39,400
and these pages are being monetized

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:41,199
using a period with links to sell fake

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,630
merchandise and other products in search

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,449
and with this type of hack what you

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,720
would notice as a site owner is that

00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:53,680
somebody would try to add himself as

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,419
some family would try to add himself as

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,460
a property owner in search console and

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,550
if you see a notification in search

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,780
console then you the probability is very

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:07,479
high that you have been hacked you might

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,949
wonder what how how do I get hacked how

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,960
they actually get access to search

00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,720
console other online accounts for

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,610
example through fishing if you're not

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,530
familiar with fishing what is it

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,289
phishing is a form of social engineering

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:25,690
that tries to trick users to reveal

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:28,660
personal information let's look at an

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:36,599
example do you notice something odd I'm

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:36,599
not sure everyone see very well sorry

00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:52,240
jackpot yes that's it one of the things

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,039
that can help you to identify a phishing

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,779
page essentially by checking out the URL

00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:00,490
and if it matches what you're usually

00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:01,990
used to but there are more things that

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,439
you can actually take into account as a

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:09,849
user to understand if a site is a

00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:12,969
phishing site or not sometimes you will

00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:17,080
also have low quality images of the

00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:23,469
logos of the brand inside a phishing

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:26,229
page or you can check out the target the

00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:28,709
target URLs if you hover over links on

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:34,899
this page if they actually bring you to

00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:36,490
another Google site or not so in a

00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,219
nutshell a phishing page will pretend to

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,830
be legitimate and ask you for personal

00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:45,009
information and in general all sites

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,919
with the login page can be used as a

00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:51,009
phishing page what can be affected by

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,099
fishing now you might think who would

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:56,379
actually fall for that nowadays um these

00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:58,120
are the numbers so the most believable

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:02,949
phishing site trick almost half of the

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,830
users and actually when hackers strike

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,479
they move very fast accounts are

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,459
accessed within 30 minutes after being

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:14,139
fished so it's really difficult to

00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:21,159
actually make up for the vulnerability

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:23,439
after you have so after all what can you

00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:26,110
do what can you do to protect your

00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,759
website better we talked about how and

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,619
why websites are being hacked now let's

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,069
look at some of the best practices that

00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:33,639
we think might help you to build safer

00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:38,019
websites

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:42,039
um we identified six it's safer looking

00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:44,409
keep systems up today HTTPS site

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,559
verification search console backups and

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,479
training now important to note here is

00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:53,499
that website security should not be

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:57,770
treated as a checklist meaning that you

00:07:53,499 --> 00:08:00,830
just have a list of five to ten

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,370
points that you just checkoff and assume

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:08,420
that the site is secure but rather like

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:10,580
building blocks that change or evolve or

00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,270
even disappear over time now why this is

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,890
the case well because the technology

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,200
changes and evolves over time passwords

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:21,200
a good example we were looking to that

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,950
in a minute and by the way so the

00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:29,540
backbone analogy is not intended but

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:32,690
looks really cool yeah let's start with

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,919
the safe login strong passwords are

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,120
essential to protect online accounts

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,789
what you see here is actually the

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,219
opposite of strong passwords these are

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:49,900
among the top 20 most used passwords and

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:52,520
can you guess from which year 2017 and

00:08:49,900 --> 00:09:00,260
does anyone recognize his or her own

00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:08,060
passwords I hope not my favorite one is

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:09,920
this one so for developers inside owners

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,990
you can find good advice on how to set

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,930
up and make your authentication process

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,550
more robust from list list stands for

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,710
the National Institute of Standards and

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,270
Technology and is the leading

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,430
organization that sets industry-wide

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:27,350
standards on security and authentication

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,900
here I would like to highlight two

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,010
distinct recommendations from this its

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,810
password limitations and password resets

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:40,730
you should think about three things when

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:43,430
you create a login page and yeah or user

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,770
accounts the first one is you should

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,589
forbid commonly used passwords for

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:51,589
example they rely on dictionary words or

00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:54,080
sequential characters like we've seen in

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:55,880
the previous slide you should also avoid

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,890
context specific words so if you're

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,350
managing a wordpress site as an admin

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:05,810
you should avoid having wordpress in

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,890
your password you should also disallow

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,410
password hints

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,990
I usually pass

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:15,700
Vin's are based on some personal

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,220
information but in today's world with

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:22,840
social media you can guess or research

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,650
many things that people actually use

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:29,020
enough in knowledge-based questions

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:31,600
example where what's your favorite car

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:35,190
or what's the name of your dog or where

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,540
your birthplace and so on and so on

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,440
and the last point is yeah you should

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,750
limit the number of password attempts to

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,960
prevent BOTS from actually running

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:52,980
scripts and doing your booth horse

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:58,150
attack the second the second

00:10:52,980 --> 00:11:05,110
recommendation is that password resets

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:07,060
are not a must the the industry has

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,590
discovered that every time you would for

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,110
example force users to reset a password

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,870
the password strength would decrease

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,730
why because with the increasing number

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,100
of online accounts it's really difficult

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,780
to create that she creates and use

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,690
unique passwords for each individual

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,810
account so users wouldn't necessarily

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:32,860
tend to use shorter or simpler passwords

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:35,110
to just be able to memorize them but

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:38,610
even the best and strongest passwords

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,870
are useless when I get fished however

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,640
having strong passwords and following

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,130
the most recent guidelines is actually

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,460
not a bad thing it's it's better than

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:51,820
having a weak password or ignoring the

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:54,550
most up-to-date advice and this is where

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,670
2-step verification comes in two or

00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:01,420
three or everything stands for sorry

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,310
protects your account with something

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,040
that you know a password and something

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,840
that you have a phone a security as

00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,990
anyone heard or is using to say

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:18,850
verification already awesome cool if not

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:19,670
this is kind of a short description of

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,180
it so

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,820
what - he does is it adds a second layer

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,370
of Fanta fication in addition to the

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,310
password and when it's enabled the user

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,100
starts the authentication process with

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:38,630
the password but it's done being asked

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,540
to perform a second step now how this

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,640
second step could look like really

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:49,880
depends on the Preferences of the user

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:54,290
you can use SMS you can use calls there

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,900
is an app provided by us security

00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,320
physical security keys a second device

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,920
backup codes probably most of you know

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:09,890
from online banking in printed form or

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:13,640
verify devices let's look at the

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:15,830
security key for example it offers the

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:20,390
highest level of protection against

00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:22,520
phishing the downsides are the cost but

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,160
you should think about potential cost of

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,620
or the impact of being hacked and

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,430
cleaning up the hack versus the price of

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:34,280
those little things if you don't want a

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,340
physical device oh yeah so there's no

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:42,350
Wi-Fi needed to use the keys they have

00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:45,980
you look like a USB stick and you can't

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,750
combine it with mobile devices and if

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,640
you don't want the physical device you

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:53,690
can also use an app in an application

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,750
instead the Google Authenticator

00:13:53,690 --> 00:14:00,890
generates a six random six digit number

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,960
and it works without an internet

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,330
connection it's easy to set up and you

00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,650
can combine it with a lot of products

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,140
and services that are not related to

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:12,490
Google at all it can be downloaded for

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,490
free in the Play Store

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,760
so this applies to certification adds an

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,740
additional layer of identification and

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,110
makes the finish process more secure it

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,000
is effective against phishing the best

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,070
practices enable it everywhere

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,420
so don't use it only for your

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:38,370
pound or for I don't know for Amazon or

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:42,710
Facebook account if you if the platform

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,710
is using is offering it just enable it

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:53,460
the second building block is updating

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:56,100
your systems technically it seems to be

00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:02,310
a trivial task but in practice is really

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:09,240
hard to do and I guess site owners

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:10,830
business owners know exactly so what are

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,400
we in Dubai systems it's actually it's

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:17,940
not limited to a CMS but it's any type

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,940
of software plugins third-party

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,510
applications why is it so important to

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,090
keep your systems up to date well

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:29,430
outdated software is like an opportunist

00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,060
you might be able to walk but it's just

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:35,250
a matter of time until you trip and fall

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,790
the second thing is that we will usually

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,200
tie your shoes before leaving the house

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,940
what I mean by that is that as a

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:47,310
developer or a site owner you should

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:50,040
think early on about updates in the

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:52,170
development process meaning even before

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,270
starting to design or develop an

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:59,460
application or a site you should already

00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:02,430
have the factor or the variable updates

00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:05,330
in mind if you take a shorter shortcut

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:08,280
here you can regret it in the future

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:13,590
this is an interesting graphing from sue

00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:15,780
curry I guess most of you can see that

00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:20,850
at the point of attack or infection most

00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:24,300
of the CMS systems were our updates and

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:30,000
sue redefines out of day by saying that

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:32,100
the CMS platform was not on the latest

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,820
security version or did not match the

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,080
CMS was available security updates when

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,800
security was actually asked to engage

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:44,019
and it's worth noting though that what

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:49,089
they're a tremendous job and decreasing

00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:57,279
this number from 2016 so in 2016 it was

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:58,959
around 61% and it dropped to 39% what

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,730
can you do as a developer or a site

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,860
owner well a lot but focus on prevention

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,500
cleaning up the hack is more time

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:11,049
consuming and painful than actually

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,600
making a system secure in the first

00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:14,220
place you can start by focusing on three

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,929
things

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,640
monitor website status check server

00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:22,799
configuration and pay attention to

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:30,640
guidelines guidelines like the one we

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:33,330
offer under those URLs you will find a

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,549
lot a lot of helpful resources under

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:41,760
developers.google.com/maps security or

00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:44,529
supported people become webmasters this

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:50,169
on the right you can see an example from

00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:55,480
the recently published heck guides check

00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:56,049
it out under new house as we discussed

00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,090
earlier

00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:02,649
a hacker would look for systemic

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:04,419
vulnerabilities and if updates or

00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:07,149
patches are available but you don't

00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,500
install them yeah kind of pointless so

00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:12,789
the best way to keep up with the most

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:19,049
recent yeah updates is to enable

00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:19,049
automatic 22 to make them automatic and

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:28,840
yeah a tip on a side avoid applications

00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:30,279
that do not offer security options when

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,309
automatic updates are not available or

00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:37,210
broken do it manually this is an example

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:40,750
where were WordPress release 4.9 3

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,240
actually had an issue with our updates

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:46,710
where the process actually didn't work

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:51,250
and if you are on 4.3 today please

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:54,950
upgrade to the most recent recent one we

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:57,220
just sent out a batch of notifications

00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:05,800
to work as webmasters to search console

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:07,940
informing them about this in summary all

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,920
systems will be hatched and updated

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,020
regularly the best practices keep your

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:17,000
code clean if you do it already

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,310
fantastic one of the things that I would

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,350
like to highlight here is that if you

00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,450
stop using parts of the CMS or plugins

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,520
or any type for any other type of

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:31,610
application then remove them completely

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:36,230
don't leave them on a server the next

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:38,240
student lock is HTTP HTTPS is to make

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:43,820
mechanism allow the browser a

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:48,310
particularly connect to to website GPS

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:51,590
is secure or encrypted version of HTTP

00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,030
if you haven't implemented HTTPS or you

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:56,660
need more talking points to convince

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:58,970
your clients think about HTTP versus

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,980
where's this way HTTP would be like

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:05,510
sending a postcard written in pencil and

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:10,820
information that you share on this

00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:11,510
postcard could be stolen modified and of

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,890
course read

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:17,060
whereas HTTP is like a sealed letter

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:21,740
it's hard to access and manipulate

00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:25,220
information and if it gets compromised

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,970
then it's really hard to say unnoticed

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,530
or to be a notice from the users

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:35,150
perspective things are going to change

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:38,360
as well for from July 2018 chrome will

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:43,310
mark non-https site is non secure and

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,440
from September 2018 HTTP will be treated

00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:51,430
as the default option so there will be

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,430
no label whatsoever for HTTPS sites

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:58,400
why should you know use HTTPS well

00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:02,450
encryption didn't have any an

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,390
identification data that is being shared

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,840
online is encrypted and it kept secure

00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,300
for news droppers

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:14,010
theda cannot be modified as i mentioned

00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:16,880
earlier or being injected with ads

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,630
melissa melissa malicious software sorry

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,030
through the network

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,090
without being detected and it actually

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:29,310
proves that your users communicate with

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:32,850
the internet sites when you think about

00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:37,770
implementation think about those four

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:40,410
things so first of all ensure robust

00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,990
security certificates if you were

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:47,360
running on a 1024 bit certificate right

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:51,570
now switch to the stronger one 2048 15th

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:57,570
use permanent redirects like the 301

00:21:51,570 --> 00:22:01,800
redirect then help us help Google to

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:05,520
find your HTTPS pages so don't block

00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:14,730
them in the robots.txt file and please

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:18,420
do not include a no index text if you're

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:22,800
using a server that allows HTS H STS

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:27,020
which stands for strict Transport

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:31,470
Security which means that if for example

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:36,120
unit hacks in the HTTP URL into a

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:38,460
browser the site will still come up in

00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,920
the HTTPS version or if you would look

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,020
on Google search for the HTTP version we

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:47,400
would still serve HTTP HTTPS one so

00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,730
enable it on your server if you don't

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,950
server offer this if you your server

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:58,560
does not reduce them maybe look for

00:22:52,950 --> 00:23:02,070
anyone HP has also enabled two

00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,780
technologies like geo locations a it's

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:08,520
also it's also improved performance and

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:12,090
you might actually see improvement in

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:15,170
the search ranking in summary enable

00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:19,960
HTTPS on all sides the best practice

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,960
there is just known just go for it do it

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,460
[Music]

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:31,400
the next building block is site

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,960
verification in search console I assume

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:40,970
most of you're familiar with search

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:42,320
console yes who is not such cons of the

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,780
free end tool

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,760
sorry free and open tool then inform

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,210
site owners about the status of the

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:55,580
website and it comes really handy when

00:23:50,210 --> 00:24:00,100
it comes to security because it notifies

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:02,000
uniforms about the health of your site

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,120
on the left you can see the navigation

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,980
menu of the old search console and on

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,470
the right you can see a snapshot of the

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:14,240
new UI of the new search console before

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,630
we get into why search console is so

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,580
important maybe some numbers so in twist

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:24,770
in 2016 we saw a 32% of more Hecate

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,860
sites and there's there are no

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:32,660
indicators that this trend is actually

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:34,250
going to change 61% of all those

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,750
webmasters who actually happen I could

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:41,180
not be reached but we know that once we

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:44,480
actually notify webmaster of a security

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:47,830
issue then 84% of those are successfully

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,700
clean up the hack meaning that

00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:54,020
communicating with website owners is

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:57,260
really important and actually having an

00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:02,180
effective method making a lot more

00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:06,410
secure and this is what exactly search

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,720
console can offer on the messages many

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,690
elections and security issues the

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,670
webmaster will receive notifications and

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:18,500
find relevant information about the site

00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:21,140
status what we often see is that site

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,380
owners that don't have a search consider

00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,950
account when they see this message in

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,429
search

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,379
they are simply overwhelmed

00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:31,840
they don't know what to do or where to

00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:34,580
go

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,769
site owners with a search console

00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,710
account would see this on the other side

00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:42,860
so if the message appears in search that

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:46,509
the site was hacked this is what they

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:49,960
see under the security issue section we

00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:53,179
provide information about the type of

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,820
issue or attack we provide example URLs

00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:58,989
and you also have a detailed description

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,779
of the problem and how to clean it up

00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:05,480
how to fix it

00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:06,799
in summary search console is free and

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,830
open to that provides real information

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,820
about the status of your site and if you

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:19,549
have multiple sites then you can or

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:22,999
should even verify all of those that's

00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:26,059
the short one have a backup it's an

00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:27,889
important part of restoring your site

00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:30,619
and cleaning up the heck after it has

00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:36,230
been compromised it helps to bring you

00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:38,419
up the original content and the original

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,299
state and the content of the site it's

00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:47,629
kind of an insurance that helps you to

00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:49,820
not to lose users or users trust again

00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:52,429
it's a short one on very straightforward

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,489
it helps to restore and recover the

00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:57,739
content and you should also think about

00:26:55,489 --> 00:27:01,309
an automated backup instead of a manual

00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:03,649
one it saves time and please be aware

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,629
that once you restore once you use a

00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:07,820
backup there might be still the

00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:09,710
vulnerability that was actually the

00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,009
reason for why your site was being

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:18,200
compromised so we move it as well or

00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:22,129
think about it the elephant in the room

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,649
in a way train employees I know that

00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:27,769
probably as a developer at this point

00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:31,309
might not be that relevant but if you

00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:35,640
work with clients I some bees that have

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:38,600
a certain number of employees then

00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,490
it's particularly important to actually

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,180
be aware what can happen what can go

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:51,420
wrong employees are not trained or

00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:53,280
another we're forced the vigilance offer

00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,890
regular and comprehensive trainings and

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,360
resources the find clear rules and

00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,700
responsibilities for individual

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,330
employees and remember how to install

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:06,330
and use third-party software our develop

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,670
escalation processes so if an incident

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:13,920
occurs then help you employees to report

00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:18,440
it and identify it one of the things

00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:21,030
that we believe is also very effective

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:27,810
tool is actually educating you in place

00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:30,060
about browser warnings like so if while

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,460
browsing the web employees or in general

00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:35,430
users would see those they should not be

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:40,500
alarmed and trust them instead of

00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:43,550
actually continuing the journey the

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:47,040
other thing is improve skills by

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:49,890
following simple rules and principles

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:53,070
for example as I mentioned how to report

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:55,530
suspicious behavior how to do a backup

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:57,420
how do you social media what to share or

00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:04,020
not to share and how to handle sensitive

00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:05,640
data in summary you should encourage

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:09,900
your employees to be part of the

00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,600
discussion about what's at security what

00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:18,030
you should avoid is actually scaring

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:24,210
them or blowing up risks or threats out

00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:27,990
of proportion so we started with this

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:30,870
question let's recap what can you do to

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,620
better protect your website the first

00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:38,880
thing is used to say verification to

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:41,010
make your login safer the second thing

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,580
is keep your systems up to date no

00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:48,330
matter the CMS plugins or any

00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,100
third-party applications implementing

00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,620
TPS

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:56,539
everywhere not only the login page but

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,980
literally across entire site verify the

00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:00,640
site in search console in order to be

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:05,030
able to receive notifications and

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:08,410
instructions exclamations of when an

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:13,240
attack occurs and how you can fix it

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:16,460
have a backup in place just in case

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,299
things go south and you will encounter

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,669
an attack and need to fix it quickly and

00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:25,100
the last one train employees don't scare

00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:27,289
them help them to be part of the

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:31,700
conversation they are an essential part

00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:33,520
of your website security if you lure if

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,840
you want to learn more about it

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,620
again these are three URLs that I would

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,470
recommend the first one is particularly

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:45,590
for interesting for developers second

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:48,440
one contains all information that we

00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:50,690
provide to masses and the third one is a

00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:56,350
platform that is being developed right

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:58,730
now that helps you to learn and

00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,980
understand common attacks like

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:06,580
cross-site scripting SQL injection and

00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,580
