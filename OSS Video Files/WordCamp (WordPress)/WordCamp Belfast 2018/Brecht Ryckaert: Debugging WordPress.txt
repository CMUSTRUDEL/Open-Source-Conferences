Title: Brecht Ryckaert: Debugging WordPress
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	We’ve all been there at least once: all of the sudden you get a blank page, or worse, a 500-error.
In this talk we’ll go over the step anyone can take to interpret the error, find more information about it, find the culprit and get it resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible.
We’ll look into the wp_debug function, error logging on the server, php settings and of course some common errors, their causes and the necessary fixes.

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,570
good morning everyone

00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:18,130
early hour it wasn't expecting such a

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,230
great turnout

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:25,170
already very pleased so Mexico for the

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,540
introduction

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,160
whooping civilians have already said

00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,860
we're at home well which is a Belgian

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,149
coastal company wherever the local

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:39,880
WordPress experts kind of thing I'm

00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:42,130
mostly passionate about WordPress

00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,100
security and worthless performance so

00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:49,030
loading time in our Tiger stick like

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,340
that but says I work as a technical

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:57,670
support team obviously I deal with

00:00:51,340 --> 00:01:00,870
debugging customers resolve issues so I

00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,870
have a couple questions for you

00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:15,939
everyone seen the website and something

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:22,119
like this perhaps a baby mates briefing

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:34,659
when migrating your website who has seen

00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:38,279
this family for just probably basically

00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,279
all seen these kind of things before

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,079
smashing the keyboard around the time

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:52,109
going on the rage but that's not the

00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,109
answer the answer lies in everything's

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,459
basically before you can buy them to be

00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:01,179
bugging me to understand that there are

00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:04,359
two kinds of errors you might run of

00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:09,700
justly there are foods that these are

00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:11,680
doing running to your song so there's

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:18,220
formula-based

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:22,599
and fighter their base éramos simplified

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:25,390
it we mean for loot you stuffed up its a

00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,239
client's ever finally it's the server

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,299
just doing something shouldn't be doing

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,790
work not processing something correctly

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:36,280
that's a reason to hide version so you

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,319
have like four others are that you dress

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:47,019
you're sending the bed progresses we

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:50,409
decide to whenever forbidden one feature

00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:57,609
looking for it and then five hundred

00:02:50,409 --> 00:03:00,870
ones are service unavailable

00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:03,760
beeping kinda knows things like that so

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:13,209
basically that's your server sitting at

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:15,189
the time know was the important part did

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,220
actually the seventies you lose an

00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:25,419
algorithm to drive to talk so we have

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:27,940
served walks obviously WP CLI scratch

00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:34,349
debug see appraised at levels blood we

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:37,250
could also use one review server logs

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:40,700
when having an issue

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:45,430
any kind of sites will you automatically

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,810
resist first to the cervix just nice

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,740
couple of people more than I expected

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,500
which is a good thing

00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,390
it should basically be your first step

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,100
we wanted to first absolutely duty

00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:00,740
because the server log will contain well

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,240
quite a lot of information on what's

00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:08,110
going wrong into our site now there's

00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,040
several types of errors in the logs

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,700
obviously you don't want to take the

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,090
hurt because that's just the execution

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:19,880
stops and it's over and out you have

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:32,720
some warnings and notices and you have

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:36,490
some limited related errors so let's

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,490
show a few examples here

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:44,020
this one for example driving tonight by

00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:47,270
server configuration this one which is

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:51,050
fairly common when for example something

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:56,060
is being blocked by out the HD axis so

00:04:51,050 --> 00:05:02,900
if you see this barely even can you

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:09,950
resort to easy access or this is one of

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:12,360
the limits related to this one just this

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,920
is a home being means to an external

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:22,280
[Music]

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:25,460
respondent I'd built that this one is

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,850
the killer but if you have this this UV

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,060
is some kind of burglars whoever

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,700
whatever but it's it's severe enough to

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,780
it I can just crash the entire

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,540
processing DPP and thus resulting you'll

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,880
see in my page of death or something

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,640
like that internal server error if it's

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:54,520
is it ever severe enough to entirely

00:05:46,640 --> 00:06:01,610
fresh the server and that's why you use

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:04,540
WP debug has anyone used it before

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:09,350
[Music]

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:12,230
so inside WP config we have simple life

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:17,930
which is ultimately quite lethal sent to

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:20,600
WP 0 it sports we can turn it on by

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,320
saying pretty much true and then it will

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:29,900
show you a lot more error information

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,520
which will help you trace the origin now

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,600
there are a few extra statements without

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,800
that because we all know showing errors

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,940
in the production environment is

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,600
probably not the best practice that's

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:48,110
why we put first and foremost as like

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,330
the debug log set truth which will

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:56,819
create a event of log file in the

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:59,759
because the pole which is heavy but

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:05,069
furthermore you can also have this one

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:08,360
the debug this late false so this would

00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:12,389
result in the result in this combination

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,180
which is the ideal setup so we've

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:20,759
enabled them to be debug which will

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:41,729
start blogging all divers will end even

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:52,620
debug box information now WP CLI it's a

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:55,710
great tool it's projects WordPress there

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:59,400
are some great tools you can use if your

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,949
hosting company doesn't have WCC live on

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,430
their servers please do yourself a favor

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,650
that you want to you go and that should

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,659
be truly standard from and server

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:14,370
already have SSH access and where your

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:16,830
hosting wordpress give you a few

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,050
commands like BB loving this it's it's

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,139
very obvious what it does will render

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,860
your hands rest with all against it

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:28,510
they're active

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:31,600
fortune if there are any or any updates

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:35,650
videos and things like that so the most

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,230
interesting part directly WP plugin get

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,020
me lactate because when we all had that

00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,610
space where we just it's called a new

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,220
plate and suddenly man went screaming

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,870
death and most leases we were able to

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:54,130
connect is ancient us to WP activates

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:57,520
say for example use SEO and the other

00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:01,480
clothing whatever and you'll be able to

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,090
distinguish from landline restoring

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,320
access and functionality of your site

00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,620
which is a very haunted

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,470
same thing with WP p mouse we also allow

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:17,850
you to activate deactivate teams gather

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:20,770
this thing there's a few new statements

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:24,100
double-checks and form was in quite some

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:29,050
while and everything checks innocence

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:31,720
version 1.5 included entities these are

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:36,240
great tools because if your site is for

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,279
example act or it is doing

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,029
quite understanding and they're seeing

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,010
the slightest impression that it might

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,510
be something going out there you did

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,899
what was about these commodities

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,760
multiple deaths and verified all of the

00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,770
core products or all of those leather

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,390
products against its version and

00:09:52,770 --> 00:10:02,520
repository and through this process

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:05,690
shoot there or have been alters if we

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,160
can concretely while resolving measures

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,589
so this is this one exact people

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:26,220
especially since we have the addition of

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:29,190
the another cool thing was sometimes WP

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,560
saliva produces unexpected results so

00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:35,670
the commands crashes to the sea like

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,029
randomly the review list it didn't give

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:42,390
me galavan I was expecting but however

00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:47,480
it is giving this unexpected some

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:56,790
variable in some websites

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:59,700
PHP know something was there I never

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,029
noticed this but this wasn't there and

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,339
didn't show anywhere else but they're

00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,829
like ran that man that's how I was able

00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:13,250
to find there was actually this was

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:21,450
actually this is unexpected

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:23,730
extra results very beginning when WTC

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,260
like does not do this because Yahoo

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,040
itself of here

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:33,089
Andy Andy as well that's a great site

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:43,350
let's go let's call that so as you can

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:47,070
see it's obvious then there's this is a

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:53,010
good thing because by default everything

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:56,310
is being minified javascript files CSS

00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:01,380
files and if you have any issues it can

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:04,800
help you just add this tag to your WT

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,720
coptic which forces wordpress to use the

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,959
non magnified versions of those

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,970
libraries those files which can easily

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,200
have

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:20,230
so any you were looking whenever these

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,230
fissures this can be in it very funny to

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:28,550
see prairies which is a another brief

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:31,640
one this is actually a green thumb to

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,890
the restitution of Jackson's do some

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,190
analysis honest though those insights

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,490
where there's you have any impression

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:43,760
that might deprive you related by having

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,280
this one 2wd company force WordPress to

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,560
store all the information all mccrary's

00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,770
into we're going to be EPA degree

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,050
pretend on the outlet you could

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,640
visualize it seventy by for adult

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,910
lighting this piece of herbs to get

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:06,190
suited up to have to treat them right

00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:06,190
all the output just got me on this piece

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:13,570
we are some plug-in as well

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:18,310
[Music]

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:25,870
first one part of poor pitiful does

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:31,140
anyone use it before you can use it to

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:39,370
just do some extra things necessary to

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:48,610
verify basic manual control of into

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:51,010
force upgrades and things like that this

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,950
is basically some more advanced which

00:13:51,010 --> 00:14:01,150
you probably won't you need right out

00:13:53,950 --> 00:14:04,450
the baskets it's there and I had to use

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:07,390
it like in 10 years I'm working a desk

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,610
right now I have uses 2 or 2 times to

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,970
get something resolved this gives you an

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:17,160
indication level it's not a it's not a

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,160
thing you'll beginning by equals

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:27,970
WPD but bar is another great solution so

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:32,010
if your love easier to do start I mean

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:36,370
save grace go to your PhD for example

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:38,980
we'd simply use this plugin which does

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,380
the same thing it would just ask you to

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,470
add the statement to do with the movie

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:48,850
company but then it'll add a bar of your

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:54,060
word press which you can just look up

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,060
the results see what's going on there

00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:01,700
now there's always medical errors we all

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:06,630
come to face one day or another

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:08,790
like who's had this one word Louisiana

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,910
you media library while still your files

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,760
are there okay

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:19,140
usually that's unhappy witness this is

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,060
the group of settle in your WP options

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,800
table

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:26,160
we often see this off to the migration

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,790
so you remove toast one company to

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,339
another zombie the stops working

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,810
protect your elbows because probably

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:36,510
your previous service has a different

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:40,950
boss being sent there than your current

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:42,270
post and this is MPA per diem to do the

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,399
correct law through the person who's

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:47,700
battling their requirements for their

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:52,410
environments will result and we need it

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:55,350
we're just magically recipient here here

00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:00,779
like any 7-9 sites just need to be my

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:07,589
wavy then we have a CSS list live they

00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:12,330
are Plus version website same thing yeah

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:25,380
UV has something to do with your site

00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:29,490
URL or a URL just not being set then

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:32,110
there's this one which is more or less

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:35,320
on the rice my person

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,450
as I seen this we used to see it was

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:43,440
pretty sweet how I see it

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:48,880
that actually I don't know why license

00:16:43,440 --> 00:17:12,760
increasingly though the issue beerus

00:16:48,880 --> 00:17:17,320
cannot modify information create some of

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:19,660
it has already sent basically means well

00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,290
well it's intended to it is not related

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:26,890
to this one this every function is going

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,840
to create some kind of output which will

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,450
result in had it being sent

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:36,630
but problem is that Heather's are only

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:39,970
and are only expected to be sent once

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,390
now if you have several plugins running

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:45,190
functions that are producing output

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:49,090
there will be sent multiple times and

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:51,360
well server across what is this so what

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:55,800
is this madman soup

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,960
there's I'm sorry just has a break there

00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,600
there's a another great fix to do this

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,910
to resolve this is actually just by

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,640
enabling output buffering in your PHP

00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,620
setup it's not the best way thus we will

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,890
be avoiding things like this

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:18,730
it's like this what's how the buffering

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:23,850
will get you a long way then back to the

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:27,300
nearby future who has heard about side

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:36,240
this is a great future awareness

00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:40,200
it's a new project very involved it

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,540
actually doing some good checks making

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:48,570
sure that spent worthless code and

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:52,620
eventually also the necessary standards

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,540
within each language so in the end

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,820
result in better over to there they're

00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:05,100
doing this by burning ultimate that's

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:07,950
yes whole bunch of minutes just yeah you

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,670
would be that whenever five minutes is

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:23,030
put into the suppository it will

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:26,750
automatically clean up roads closed

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,750
they're using

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,820
skating sorry

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:44,630
I'll try to get it back to that it's a

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,630
monthly - they just recently use its

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:55,700
altar about nothing it's really

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:07,500
important what can you do as a beautiful

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:12,210
basically report books ambitious to

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:15,000
developers and don't do it in a metro

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,870
hey I need this fix right now this is an

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,400
error please other deaths most

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,590
developers of the workers community

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,750
aren't even doing this full-time as

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,700
their main job we're all in that's just

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,140
because we love WordPress we want to

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,800
make it better

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,900
but be constructive and provide as much

00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,350
information as you can about that this

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,600
will help the developer to go a long way

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:43,500
in that meeting their needs and

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,060
everything's fixed at least try to

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,880
provide some information on how to

00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:50,300
reduce the ever that does need to be

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,300
great

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:58,260
that's about what I have right now I've

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,530
been rushing this we started the

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,530
mid-late on our team and questions

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,560
