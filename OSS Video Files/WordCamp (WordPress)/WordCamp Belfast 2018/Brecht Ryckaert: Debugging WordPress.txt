Description: 
	We’ve all been there at least once: all of the sudden you get a blank page, or worse, a 500-error.
In this talk we’ll go over the step anyone can take to interpret the error, find more information about it, find the culprit and get it resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible.
We’ll look into the wp_debug function, error logging on the server, php settings and of course some common errors, their causes and the necessary fixes.
