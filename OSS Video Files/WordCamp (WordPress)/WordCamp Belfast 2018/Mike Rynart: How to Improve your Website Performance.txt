much power you have and with WordPress

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,479
enabling us to

00:01:25,840 --> 00:03:12,519
anything we want WordPress is giving us

00:01:30,490 --> 00:03:16,329
will be surprised to see parts the 15th

00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:20,019
anniversary I'm really happy to be here

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:23,319
I think it's really cool this words can

00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:27,190
Belfast is they're one of the only birth

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:30,130
camps dependants the only today in the

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:34,000
world yes yeah it's so really amazing

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:41,829
you have to be part of this I've been

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,500
using WordPress 6 and immediately I saw

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,019
that yeah flexibility of WordPress

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,750
that's it could be much much more than

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,030
just blogging when I first started I

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,180
just started with a personal blog

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:58,239
putting upended pictures but yeah

00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,359
quickly I found out I could then used as

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:06,340
a full-blown CMS to build a company

00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:11,500
website so there are WordPress is

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:15,069
allowing us to do more and more and yeah

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,459
by that we are rolling into a common

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:21,190
problem and that is very person about

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:25,320
WordPress and that's performance so we

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:28,780
often hear that sites running WordPress

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,890
yeah they tend to load slow because yeah

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:36,130
we were loading more and more assets so

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,340
more research and resources than other

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,979
sites so there are some reports out

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,930
there that they say WordPress is slow

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:49,000
compared to other sites I think yeah we

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,110
can definitely make WordPress a lot

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,289
faster just by tweaking tweaking our

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,650
sites with certain plugins

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:06,039
you have to be focusing on performance

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:15,270
and yeah by with the community of birth

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:17,940
press so what I will talk about today I

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,949
give you world through a tour of

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:24,819
performance I will talk about three main

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:30,750
areas and we will talk about first about

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:36,009
why performance matters according to

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:38,380
statistics nowadays almost half our web

00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:41,440
traffic go to our websites is coming

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,259
from a mobile device and people are

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,840
using mobile for everything these days

00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:50,020
I can see here the public people

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,389
checking their phones we cannot leave

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,060
our phones like five seconds you know we

00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,669
need to check what's going on so you're

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,909
constantly searching internet through

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:03,280
our mobile phones and yeah I think that

00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:05,500
myself when I come home from work I

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,780
don't even look at my laptop anymore I

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:13,900
just take out my phone and start

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:18,039
searching according to recent reports it

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:21,550
was found out as sixties almost maybe

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:31,169
60% of all my searches is coming from

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:36,340
mobile so he also mentions SEO it's

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:42,340
important yeah focus your websites for

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:50,320
mobile devices so this data isn't is it

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:51,690
unnoticed by Google Mobile first index

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,680
for the first time

00:06:51,690 --> 00:07:00,009
Google switched their search index

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:05,380
mobile first index oh it's still quite

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:08,800
new and yeah rolling it out concert by

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:14,320
country and they will notify web

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:18,779
developers about when when they switch

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:22,150
the first index so it's extremely

00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:24,669
important for for us deaths yeah our

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:29,320
website is mobile friendly and that it's

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:31,900
accessible on mobile device and you can

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:35,770
say blow of headache by just installing

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:38,650
mobile friendly teams there're a lot of

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,770
teams out there today and that's one of

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,770
the advantages of WordPress that we can

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,270
just switch our complete sites to a

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,270
mobile sites or just

00:07:50,099 --> 00:08:04,979
another important thing about the mobile

00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:08,190
first index is our site performs fast so

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:14,889
speeds becoming more and more important

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:17,889
every day there are many reports out

00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:22,150
there but most importantly users expect

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:24,250
their website instantly they just want

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:30,690
access to information as fast as

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:30,690
possible wait for the loading screen

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,980
according to our reports 53% of your

00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:40,740
mobile sizes

00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:44,130
we'll leave your citations if it takes

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,850
three seconds or longer to live so it

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:51,710
could be losing half of your customers

00:08:46,850 --> 00:09:01,920
before they even see your sights so

00:08:51,710 --> 00:09:06,030
performance with today's fastest car you

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,850
know this car bus it's the new roadster

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,790
of this look Ellen most said it's the

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,880
fastest car in the world and they go

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,010
from zero to 60 and just die in less

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,350
than two seconds

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:22,710
well nowadays most of the sides aren't

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:26,610
that fast so the average those I'm

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:29,750
looking over work is 15 seconds and it's

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,290
far too slow if you consider that's

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,290
three seconds

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:43,890
well it's my first visit to Belfast and

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:49,170
I was really curious you have to know

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:51,050
more about it and before coming here I

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,390
definitely want to know more about

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,810
Belfast so I thought so let me search on

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,150
Google what's what's is there to see him

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:04,610
so even lowly planner says Belfast is

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:07,980
the best place to visit in 2013 yeah

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,280
well I thought my mum's almost the best

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,280
place

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,929
[Music]

00:10:42,570 --> 00:11:36,130
or maybe they can help definitely help

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:44,230
get more visitors to their website and

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:45,040
zobelle and is a new site as well it's

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,500
really impressed

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,279
I really enjoy it's a great experience

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,880
with great video my pictures but somehow

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,880
they know

00:11:54,549 --> 00:12:01,160
homework words get that Belfast is doing

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:03,079
much better just be within three seconds

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:13,759
so that's excellent

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:19,249
that's because mark paddles so when it

00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:24,939
comes to the mobile websites matters the

00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:24,939
average size of the mobile web page

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:42,790
around three megabytes and I mainly

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:45,589
caused by images JavaScript so the

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,420
websites now it's getting bigger the

00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:53,179
mobile web is getting bigger and bigger

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:55,819
each year and today the file size of the

00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:59,389
mobile web is roughly or basically the

00:12:55,819 --> 00:13:05,119
same even more than the original game of

00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:09,679
doom so yeah pages have grown into a

00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:14,089
block of images and JavaScript and too

00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:16,699
many elements if you consider boom it's

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:20,179
the first-person shooter with 3d

00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:23,739
graphics multiple levels sound effects

00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:27,589
and today we are yeah still struggling

00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:32,559
footings putting out a web based with

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:32,559
the same sizes quite amazing

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:40,329
well the good news is that 4G is now at

00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:43,089
the global standards when it comes to

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:47,049
measuring your mobile speed so it used

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:53,079
to be treaty so but nowadays 4G is

00:13:47,049 --> 00:14:01,869
pretty much cover it helps us to speak

00:13:53,079 --> 00:14:06,429
up for maps user experience is not the

00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:11,079
only factor for when it comes to mobile

00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:21,489
speed google has announced that they

00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:39,809
will be rolling out so they will take

00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:39,809
page speeds as a ranking factor yeah

00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:50,019
they also have a pool of various the

00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:52,540
scorecard so it helps you compare your

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:56,470
sites see how you stack up to the

00:14:52,540 --> 00:15:00,339
competition they recommend that your

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,350
mobile websites loads in five seconds or

00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:06,970
less

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:10,120
device some compare sitting of the dock

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:13,630
websites were linking WordPress and yes

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,410
you can see that it is quite possible to

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:21,700
have your website load in within five

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:24,130
seconds so and these are like websites

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,740
that put millions of visitors and their

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:30,970
a news website so it's not surprising

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:36,190
the myths yeah speed this very important

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:45,269
for them that's what's probably also why

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:48,540
they become so big if you ever need to

00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:52,029
if you ever want to do performance work

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,680
to convince your your feet or your

00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:57,250
clothes

00:15:52,680 --> 00:16:00,250
there's a out there which is called WP o

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:06,190
stats so that our multiple case studies

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:11,079
and updated frequently and also I skates

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:16,240
are you smart big press extra doing web

00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:20,230
performance or 50 50 % increase in SEO

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,260
more engagements conversions so

00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:27,310
Financial Times

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:32,370
well these companies all seem seen many

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,370
benefits for optimizing their websites

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:41,350
so web performance is about retaining

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,770
users the cast of your site loads the

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,770
mooner

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:48,089
people will stay on the sciences but

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,089
performance is about user experience

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:55,870
it's about conversions that the faster

00:16:52,120 --> 00:17:00,130
site loads it will give our users more

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:02,440
trust and make them

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,110
easier to buy something on your sites

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,600
but most importantly web performance is

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:11,620
about because we want to help people

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:18,120
find answers to their questions as fast

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:22,049
as possible so now that we talked about

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:26,520
why performance is so important I will

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:29,950
continue with web performance management

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:34,850
in my mind web performance is

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:36,780
measurements it doesn't make sense

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,640
[Music]

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,419
before you start improving something you

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,419
need to know

00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:51,669
yeah very extensive there are many tools

00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:58,799
out there that you can use and so just

00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:58,799
many of you there I think hundreds of

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:19,059
metrics tools also the WordPress

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:24,880
community web page some of the tools

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:29,440
were also mentioned this weekend I guess

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:32,350
you are familiar with some of them so

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,179
I'm not going to detail every tool but I

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,179
will just show some screenshots

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:44,320
what I like about them web page test is

00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:48,909
actually the this standards for

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:55,260
measuring and performance it gives a lot

00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:55,260
of detailed information one of the

00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:05,100
metric I like is the speed index speed

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:07,470
index tells how fast your website

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,710
showing how fast the contents of your

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:14,100
website this showing to the user so it's

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:17,789
really giving the user experience kind

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,370
of metric for your websites you want to

00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:24,929
keep this as low as possible and promote

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:28,100
by now you will do VB loads for 3

00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,100
minutes 3 seconds

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:40,460
yeah they quit based as they

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:46,080
milliseconds but my station it says

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:51,320
other cool features wonderful view is

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,320
highly your site loads older contents

00:19:54,409 --> 00:20:00,770
when looking at the wonderful view you

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:05,940
wanna focus on the ya long horizontal

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:07,980
particle the shorter the better so we

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,440
want them want to keep them as short as

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,990
possible so if you do performance work

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,620
you focus on the wrong bars and see how

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:21,360
you can optimize it as the longer the

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:25,020
bar the longer the loads is also it will

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,650
show some gold bars we have yellow in

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:32,150
this case which will send red yellow is

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:34,559
for third-party scripts red is for

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,890
scripts that cannot be found on files

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,890
that's

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:45,749
well all these figures and numbers yeah

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,629
they're actually selling off of the

00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:52,619
story cuz it doesn't say anything you

00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:55,019
know what once the user sees so then

00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:58,559
another neat feature or web database

00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:06,119
this is that Phillips 30 which actually

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:13,309
shows what the user sees and now you can

00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:13,309
do some embarrassing bear before

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,440
[Music]

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:27,330
performance there are lots of metrics

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:34,739
involved listen to your few and with the

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:38,580
recommended sizes times there are many

00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:42,090
more I wish I could say that you should

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,129
focus on one certain metric but yeah it

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:51,330
really comes down to yeah what you're

00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:54,570
after it's for me I for me the most

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,789
important elements is like when my hero

00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:00,480
image comes into picture in go to

00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:05,009
actions you can also nowadays as time

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:09,090
steps and when your image is shown when

00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:10,830
you call to action button is there so we

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,149
really have to figure out what you're

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:20,169
after and focus

00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:23,349
to improve for all these metrics manual

00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:26,669
testing and yeah you can do but it takes

00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:29,979
a lot of time so an easier way is to

00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:32,440
automate some testing there are many

00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:38,200
services out there that you can run

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:40,960
automated tests everyday and see by

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,409
doing it by automating it you can set

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,469
the budgets and by doing that you're

00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:52,299
basically setting a performance budget

00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:58,169
so we'd say my budgets for total paid

00:22:52,299 --> 00:23:01,229
size is 1.5 megabytes and your sites

00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:06,149
goes over that you'll be automatically

00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:12,509
alerted a your base size has increased

00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:12,509
it helps to keep our website performance

00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:20,830
so how fast our website loads

00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:23,259
I mean how fast is fast enough well for

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:26,349
personally I look at some of my

00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:30,039
competition I want to know how fast the

00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:32,200
competition looks so I'm using speed

00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:34,779
surf there's a nice feature that you can

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,259
benchmark your website's compared to

00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:40,359
other websites so and somebody is faster

00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:42,669
than me I want to know why are they

00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:47,700
faster are they loading more resources

00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:47,700
or less resources so that teach you

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,290
because at the end effects to their

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:57,620
website notes the battery directly will

00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:03,320
be in performance is our experience and

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:07,520
so on so nobody talks about measurements

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:11,420
and finds out the bull necks and what no

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,670
what we need to fix go over some high

00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:18,500
performance tips and tricks what you

00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:23,060
thinking today for that I will be using

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:28,130
what my own size I already told you I

00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:31,640
started in 2006 and since then Heidi

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:38,110
I've built so many sites but what I like

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:42,560
is really about to works I built many

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:45,500
funds from all around the world so I'm

00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:50,090
really always now interesting to find

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:53,780
out new things and cities to write about

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:57,700
it and one of the driving blocks I

00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,700
understood my needs were ecstatic

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:08,780
it's the grim I really enjoyed here the

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:18,810
best thing about having a Trekkie book

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:31,110
because popular you get using my website

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:36,510
as a case study what I did that's my

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:39,270
site how fast it is performing there are

00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,730
many tools I'll Terry well there are a

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,680
lot of advanced tools out there that you

00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,440
can use to give more detailed

00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,650
information but what I like about just

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:54,210
my site is that these tools will be

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:56,640
actually to be used by your customer by

00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:00,690
your bosses and they will be coming to

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,510
you with figures in red saying my site

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:06,660
not performing so definitely check out

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:11,490
your website from this tool because if

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:15,330
you don't your customer was but I

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:18,360
checked my site I it was slowly in seven

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:24,360
seconds so that's what's not and was

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:28,370
average so I decided well the first

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:32,340
thing when it comes to performance is

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:38,340
hosting when looking for roots

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:41,429
make sure you SSL a psb7

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:44,130
and also you might want to consider a

00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:46,500
CDN so that it's accessible from all

00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:51,440
around the world as fast as possible I

00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:53,730
won't go into much detail but hb7 is

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,270
definitely will make your website's that

00:26:53,730 --> 00:27:01,400
much faster and reports that show it can

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,400
make your website almost twice as fast

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:11,990
most of the performance work is is done

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:17,549
in the front ends because elements

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:26,700
images JavaScript yeah when you think

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:29,730
about performance when it comes to

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:35,610
images yeah we definitely can improve a

00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:37,730
lot 25% for websites good save 250

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:41,820
kilobytes

00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:45,179
there are many ways to check what needs

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:52,080
which is optimized so the different

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:55,350
tools will show my colors inside they

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,110
will give a list of images

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:02,010
we download the optimized images and

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:06,540
upload them again to your site I think

00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:11,940
I'll skip the image optimization slices

00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:20,060
about talked so much about images there

00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:25,970
is a great guys in the web yes a great

00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:25,970
optimize and which format you choose

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:35,400
there are so many pockets when it comes

00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:40,740
to plugins yeah there are so many

00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:46,920
plugins out there and like you think

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:50,640
which plugins should I use so I've been

00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:55,170
reading about about Google is hiring web

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:58,500
developers from WordPress they are busy

00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:01,800
with a new projects called sites which

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,930
is gonna help WordPress users to make

00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,600
better choices when it comes to plugins

00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,970
and themes so in order to add more

00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:13,020
website more performance reliable and

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:16,260
secure so and when you'll be searching

00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:20,340
for plugins know that they're thinking

00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:22,830
about adding an extra score tied score

00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:31,800
but it will basically tell you if the

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:35,970
blogging is so if lucky and I knew

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:38,970
women's optimizers right now I just

00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,150
check how many times good-looking in

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:45,700
dogs you know

00:29:40,150 --> 00:30:07,680
it's refused you could also do it

00:29:45,700 --> 00:30:07,680
manually it'll be four minutes all right

00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,560
when people complain that your website

00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:18,870
or their website this little one of the

00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:21,700
first things to check is the first place

00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:28,750
you can see this actually right in your

00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:33,450
browser to grow Mia the growing

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:38,050
developer tools just by pressing come on

00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:41,580
come on option wide you can go to the

00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:45,940
network tab and from the timing that you

00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:48,390
can see the time to first byte for

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,390
mobile

00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:59,749
when when you set up the websites took

00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:04,549
place may look something like this out

00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:07,309
of the box yeah whitespace either source

00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:15,470
comes with you few source codes little

00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:18,739
bit base it's not optimized many fire

00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:21,649
codes compresses environments as much as

00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:23,769
possible and there are many tools out

00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:27,950
there plugins that can help us with it

00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:33,109
one of the most popular walnut W super

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:35,299
cache and w3 total cache they will

00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:38,049
basically turn your dynamic contents

00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:41,330
into static content so that it will

00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:44,869
decrease the response time of charity of

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:47,629
your websites there's another plug-in

00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:52,909
both out of optimize which will help

00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:54,710
it's combining all the scripts so the

00:31:52,909 --> 00:32:00,129
total decks will be complete much

00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:00,129
smaller so we have everything optimized

00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:16,410
source codes compiles into

00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:18,870
minifides source codes another thing you

00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,900
want to be checking this well

00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:29,190
when optimizing my websites get it done

00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:40,590
from 765 3 is the number of service

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:44,370
requests check my sites 34 requests so

00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:46,679
I'd like to travel lights and yeah it

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,830
would be great if we wouldn't have to

00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,830
loads everything on our web page that we

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:56,010
don't need when we install the plugin

00:32:52,830 --> 00:33:09,510
there are some pages that that plugin is

00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:14,070
not used like when load filter basically

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:18,210
lets you set where you want to loads

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:20,370
which plugin so that's you don't those

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:28,440
are necessary resources some pages

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:31,350
that's features and you can set it per

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,650
page and burn plug-in where you want

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,650
once

00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:45,250
now this shows also with a screen from

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:48,250
screen speakers which shows before and

00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:57,130
after optimizing your sites was trying

00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:59,470
to impact the optimization if you're so

00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:05,110
extra doing all these all these things I

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:07,000
was able to improve my site second for

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:16,230
me it was good enough to left in the

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:24,640
green that you use check that's on

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:36,610
multiple multiple I don't go for a

00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:47,190
percent oh there's more to life than

00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:49,870
increasing these speeds you're still

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:54,270
probably yeah

00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:57,940
increasing your website speed I consider

00:34:54,270 --> 00:35:00,640
I don't know probably it will split the

00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,700
room in two because it all snow that

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,140
people are against and they don't want

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,760
to get all their control to Google I was

00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:14,020
at the end conference

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,060
beginning this year I was really

00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:19,090
surprised by all the new features coming

00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,680
Allison I think lamented on my site and

00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,400
when I

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:27,290
started and I was only able to create a

00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,809
very basic base but nowadays companies

00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:33,359
they'll compete complete boom boom and

00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:35,940
pages that's and that you can hardly

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:46,500
tell the difference between a normal

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:49,770
website in any way so yeah especially

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,450
for mobile that's working there are

00:35:49,770 --> 00:36:01,770
several loads for that as well and most

00:35:53,450 --> 00:36:09,569
popular one is and it's all one needing

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:12,540
you to make your websites and so yeah

00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:16,410
