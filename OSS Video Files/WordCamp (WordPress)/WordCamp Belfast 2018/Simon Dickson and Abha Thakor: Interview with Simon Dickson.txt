00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,719
thought myself you don't see me the

at any of your actually in the room I

00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:37,730

have slightly different but again ice

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
about breaking down barriers we have

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,090
actually been putting out some messages

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,790
to people about trying to find cyclist

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,280
some of the WordPress community inspired

00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:37,220
by your picture so and to the extent

00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,390
that but that Neil part of the word camp

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,790

webcam belfast so so there you are

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:49,729
inspiring every level so we otherwise it

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,650
to have you and we're going to look

00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,750
forward to so let's talk which you're

00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,770
also going to be using as part of the

00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:02,630
WordPress 15 year anniversary so say

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:04,250
thank you very much it's Simon I know

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,759
you love nothing better than talking

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:12,170
about cycling and WordPress whichever

00:02:07,759 --> 00:03:36,000
order depends on on the occasion I've

00:02:12,170 --> 00:03:41,370
together and it's very easy to find some

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,079
kind of may not be a bike but find

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,299
something that means you can just walk

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:54,720
away from it that makes kids get a hobby

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:57,590
getting interest I don't have to ask any

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,590
cyclist in the room

00:04:08,450 --> 00:05:57,780
how did you discover it wasn't me not

00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,760
very genuinely there were exciting

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,840
people talking positively about this

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,319
WordPress thing

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,240
[Music]

00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,180
I'd like to think I'm a pretty good

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,619
judge of the signals only since if good

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,399
people are interested in this I probably

00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,339
should look into it

00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,610
and I started playing with it I find

00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:18,710
various things that he could do that

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,319
other software couldn't do and I began

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,119
to realize that this was then the

00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,849
content management system that I was

00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:28,309
begging people to do it for me

00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:32,990
I've seen a lot of money being said you

00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:34,339
know it so happens but you know I was

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,349
beginning to realize that they weren't

00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:43,729
any smarter than I was worse as this and

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:50,689
yet here's this free thing that I could

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:52,729
just download and use things like it

00:06:50,689 --> 00:07:01,869
could just generate RSS feeds really

00:06:52,729 --> 00:07:01,869
easily and I start to find Mexican music

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:08,659
[Music]

00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:13,969
professional agency we realized that

00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:16,909
WordPress could do what most people know

00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:19,189
I would say holding deck and to get to

00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,139
this point the lease is not to use

00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:28,370
WordPress to disappear I don't see

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:31,490
anything but yeah two thousand five six

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,349
seven do it now and I was able to take

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:40,699
that in to some of those large

00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:42,680
organizations look I know what you want

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,439
and this is it this thing is here and it

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,969
works and the software itself is free no

00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,719
I'm not gonna come free you're gonna

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:54,680
need my expertise in my experience for

00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:56,749
you properly but within a couple of

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,610
weeks maybe a couple of months you will

00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:01,959
have a thing that you have been crying

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,959
out for four years

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,759
a spot that says that someone's still

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,349
not Sun but I say it if this tree

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,910
actually is true and you know I were not

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,860
dated then with a very very large

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,819
enterprises and they are in the same

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,699
position still they work with large IT

00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,759
Sciences in charge them six-figure sons

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,710
seven-figure sons to get content

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,099
Microsystems that don't do what they

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:34,190
want I have seen some shocking things

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:52,580
behind the scenes it's a very very large

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:54,910
corporations and publishing companies as

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,589
part of a 15 year anniversary

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:02,149
celebrations we're actually going to be

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:03,920
swapping a video of Simon talking with

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:09,110
some of the other work camps that taking

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:12,760
place even as weekend say so so say

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,760
hello to through other workouts

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,820
assignment you obviously now work for

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,770
somatic and you lead European business

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,560
development for the VIP program at

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,480
wordpress.com promoting the benefits of

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,730
workplace to large-scale publishers and

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,589
enterprises and also supporting the

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,130
growth of Europe's leading workplace

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:37,700
specialist agencies before like you did

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,620
you co-founded code for the people you

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,490
tell us a little bit about your

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,490
inspiration for doing

00:09:51,040 --> 00:12:25,640
to individual I realize I could see were

00:11:19,130 --> 00:12:28,280
able to put together because because I

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,150
think that's what's made WordPress the

00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:34,790
success

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:41,750
it's the so many of us want to push the

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:43,070
opportunities necessarily but be

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,209
building an ambitious when you're

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:49,910
building something build it right use

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:53,180
that that plug-in architecture create

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:57,140
something that can be reused possibly

00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:12,020
open-source now as an individual doing

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:15,440
it as a similar that's the first couple

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,089
of hires to be honest probably diminish

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,830
your efficiency a little bit when you

00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:22,010
add your second person you didn't double

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:25,310
your capacity maybe a half but when you

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:29,060
start adding three for either team there

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:31,790
is slack there is that Skipton to bring

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:35,870
the ambition to projects and start to do

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,400
really significant things and then the

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,740
final part of that they're part of

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,200
people often forget about is to talk

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,110
about it tell people what you're doing

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,910
put that kid right there so again

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,910
because we have small team you can kind

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,860
of cover each other event we would send

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,490
people off to workers we would allowed

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,490
people to do

00:13:58,940 --> 00:15:24,360
it's not necessarily something you're

00:14:38,220 --> 00:15:26,579
actually doing is just everybody just

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,790
looks inspired so that's got to be a

00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:31,459
good thing so how does he code for the

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,640
people was acquired by us in my second

00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:37,260
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,600
so tribute to their success now who in

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:47,250
the room remembers the howdy on

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:49,470
WordPress admin yeah but do you know the

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:53,760
person who got rid of Rob who actually

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:56,720
was behind it and and more importantly

00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,720
got rid of it

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:03,560
it's still ever and he's still out okay

00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:06,990
so I think late partial credit for that

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,640
it was a joke it was a joke what

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,670
presidents just started to get into

00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,260
translations a line and passing them on

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,360
to one of the core developers okay will

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,950
be really funny middle of this

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,540
translation it work better you can get

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,310
rid of that daddy and then about an army

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,080
again about her I should stop saying

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,730
these things about an hour later I got

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,320
an email innocent congratulations you've

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,170
been appointed the lead translator for

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,200
UK English and we use the translation

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:37,170
function to take hardly others and then

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,260
we engage in huge argument as to watch

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:43,680
it replace it because the one thing

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,610
WordPress has in its admin is a sense of

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,870
personality

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,700
now that personality has been nuts Texan

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,900
personality in a lot of respects

00:16:50,700 --> 00:17:05,280
I like the fact that it's got

00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:07,440
personality that Americanism just like

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,250
the idea of WordPress logged in it's ed

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,800
hardy not immediately put them off there

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:17,040
are languages within you will wear this

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,459
is particularly strongly felt so German

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:34,440
for example has a formal and an informal

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:35,850
translation because work is so if you

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,800
want to keep your heart if you want to

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:44,250
keep your customization with Z or Z if

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,040
your bottom is spent properly and as as

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,420
has been pointed out to be subsequently

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:53,490
inefficiently because color is only five

00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:55,820
letters but we may insist actually you

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,380
know I really think that that helps

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,380
people's engagement with WordPress that

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,730
means it is talking their language

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,730
literally yeah we've got

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:12,270
well over a hundred different languages

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,710
the presses are available in including

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:18,640
seven or eight different flavors in

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:22,330
English terms like Canadian Australian

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,980
New Zealand English Irish South African

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:29,110
all pretty much the same it's the

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:30,580
American difference I think that's a

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:34,450
real strength in WordPress the pocket

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:45,400
you can do something you can make a

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:47,770
stupid joke and it becomes so when I

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,820
search it work out London you are coming

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:54,670
to Belfast aren't you eat I was really

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,040
lucky that you took that as a as a yes

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,870
and didn't mention the fact that we've

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,390
actually want you to be on our on our

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:04,210
panel but no that's a so yes say that

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:59,280
the man who made that difference now the

00:19:04,210 --> 00:20:04,510
next is who came from and what to do

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:07,600
1,000 plus events now Japan in Japan it

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,320
was incredibly insurer and it were very

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,419
very shy

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,159
see some of the great things that were

00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:59,090
happening in Japan just never got ours

00:20:13,159 --> 00:21:02,139
uh one of the things was the part that

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:06,529
was the first weapon that came outside

00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:10,399
Japan and I really love the way that the

00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:13,759
community is embraced there because what

00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:27,169
I think we do bite by doing that is send

00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:31,320
a signal and this idea that you have so

00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:34,200
now anyone can you go to any plugin

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:37,470
that's company everyone's not gonna walk

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,660
through no actually it says a lot about

00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:44,460
the good things in the business what

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:47,280
proved is an open source it is

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,760
explicitly licensed under GPL you are

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,180
free to dine with modify it

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:58,230
use it on you like t-shirts you create

00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:00,060
web design you can share it with the one

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,090
thing I would ask is please don't turn

00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,440
walkthrough into different animals but

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,000
really annoying so yes I do include

00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,280
unicorns I can see you looking at me

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,640
never walk through is walking don't

00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:20,310
change it I'm excluding bells I've seen

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:28,100
Cookie Monster don't overstretch it you

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:28,100
know but anyway to use these gestures

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:39,480
should we are a global community very

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,730
inclusive community but we may have

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,730
space for people of all different kinds

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,670
of creativity so if your thing is

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:51,330
cartoon mascots

00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:52,980
raise your hand you know that is as

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:57,500
important to the community and that

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,500
sense of collaboration and participation

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,060
any local artist and me any audience

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:13,710
going back to your day job what

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,510
challenges do you typically see when

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,460
you're actually working with large

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:21,980
enterprises who would take me on

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,980
WordPress or considering using WordPress

00:23:22,930 --> 00:24:21,740
it's changed in nature and consider it

00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:35,900
to be auto power with a kind of high

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:37,880
price the challenge I think of WordPress

00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:42,530
used to be convincing people that it was

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,560
more than just a simple basic I think as

00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:50,420
the market share number has grown thanks

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,890
to things like the REST API more press

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,500
is a safe bet knowledge of anything

00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,720
never used to be so if you can say that

00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,940
a third of the top 10 million websites

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,440
of WordPress that gives Enterprise

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,420
procurement people a sense of confidence

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,630
what price is not gonna give away

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,350
anytime soon because huge chunks of the

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,650
Internet

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:16,660
right up to tragically enough Donald

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:19,610
Trump's want us rely on WordPress know

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:23,310
if you're going to spend a lot of money

00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:26,910
buying licenses for a CMS

00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:28,320
you don't maybe something you don't get

00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,400
about companies gonna be there next week

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,820
next month next year

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,710
thank you good bust they could change

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,360
the business model they could be

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,860
required by somebody else who decides

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,580
they're gonna do a different thing with

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:45,390
the software people WordPress ain't

00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:49,050
going away because he away it's too many

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:51,360
of us and even if not Nolan what I think

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,130
I had a bad night and came in in

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,300
deciding who's gonna tell WordPress down

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:57,600
it or turn it into something completely

00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:01,550
different but open-source rules say that

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,550
we can take ownership of that

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:08,070
it can't be taken away from the

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:12,990
community so suddenly it looks like the

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:14,850
same fence and convincing enterprises

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,570
that this is pretty much what I do it

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:22,200
for my danger it's getting through that

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:25,430
instinctive sense that large corporate

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,790
solutions are better and actually

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:33,240
grassroots solutions I think are really

00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:35,130
if you are bringing in technology in you

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,910
probably want the one that people have

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:41,070
seen and have used at home and the one

00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,110
that has the large number of commercial

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:46,980
plugins the one with the hosting

00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:49,860
companies all optimizing there's so many

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,100
big business reasons not to choose

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,460
WordPress we're not making roughly

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,930
talking in in positive terms of what it

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,030
can do more what it can bring to the

00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:04,770
table and some of the people that I talk

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:07,800
to are corporations you know the scale I

00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:10,140
would never imagined we talked to some

00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,210
of the biggest hikes on the planet we

00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,970
talked to governments we talked to some

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,700
of the biggest companies on the planet

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:21,480
and and what I find really interesting

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:27,420
the vehm is that they consider

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,980
themselves part of the underdog they

00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,730
consider themselves be grass roots

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,330
because my they were dominant before

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:40,200
they're not scared stiff or feeble

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:42,270
Amazon Facebook it freaks me out when I

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,000
hear about newspapers wanting to put

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:47,760
their business model into the hands of

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:57,929
one of their direct models they would

00:27:47,760 --> 00:28:00,210
have paid The Washington Post has the

00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:07,429
potential and some might say the track

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:07,429
record it's a very very rich

00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:15,600
so I I talked to some people and some

00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:19,380
very very large corporations we were

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,360
threatened and see WordPress as their

00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,559
escape

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,630
this is the way that they can take

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,700
charge of their own destiny so when we

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,669
talk about only human content and

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:36,059
they've in charge of you as individuals

00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:38,730
you should do that as you do that big

00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:46,049
corporations I'm starting to think the

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:49,320
same way because they have to people

00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:51,120
think of them the VIP service that let

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,309
us do they tend to think of the large

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,860
American websites but you obviously been

00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:58,169
quite lured in other parts of the world

00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:04,289
and Sicari in Europe how is that

00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:16,919
different a lot lately the proposition

00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:22,400
to media is if you're a modestly

00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,400
successful media website in America

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,670
[Music]

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:35,190
Europe is not one single market it's

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,559
lots of little ones that all have

00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:40,039
different language issues cultural

00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,039
issues

00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,460
so that model doesn't work quite so well

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:50,430
over here what we're finding success

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:55,030
with is corporate users particularly

00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:56,980
using WordPress multi-site to to publish

00:29:55,030 --> 00:30:01,240
in multiple languages to tailor their

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:03,850
sites to local markets what's happening

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:11,680
behind the scenes at sport is a really

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:14,370
interesting one your experts are really

00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,370
getting into soccer

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,100
we saw where a major Spanish newspaper

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,310
ain't gonna sell too many cars outside

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:33,340
stone Real Madrid gets a long run some

00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:34,840
traffic outside Spain and we don't do

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:49,740
around a drink I'd better clarify that

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:49,740
but I'd see a lot of interest in what

00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,830
would your advice be to agencies who

00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:17,520
want to establish themselves as

00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:17,520
WordPress specialists against it I think

00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,030
[Music]

00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:35,890
and I think there are opportunities

00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,320
within the WordPress there's a new wave

00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:41,890
them opportunities about to open up that

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,650
make it even more relevant to declare

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,210
yourself a WordPress expert so if you

00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,570
think about what Gutenberg

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:53,470
is going to do to impress an experience

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:57,669
of WordPress it will transform I suggest

00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:59,549
over the next one to two years we're

00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:05,080
going to need people who understand that

00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:07,179
so I would strongly recommend that if

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,799
you've got the capacity to look at good

00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:10,509
book and get used to what it's going to

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:16,059
do the WordPress you should be doing

00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:17,470
that when people say I've got this

00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:20,399
project I want to get a little WordPress

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:26,769
I would love to use this funky new block

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:31,240
gotta find something could be that

00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:34,029
person so make your mark find out about

00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:38,210
it talk about it don't worry about being

00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:39,779
video experts just you know waiting

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,240
[Music]

00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:45,039
document with progress tell your stories

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,249
learn your lessons and then pass it on I

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:54,070
would love to see people standing up and

00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:58,330
talking and you know what by doing that

00:32:54,070 --> 00:33:04,899
you you then become one of the go-to

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:18,129
people the great thing about WordPress

00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:24,309
is that if you're putting good stuff out

00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:26,619
there and with me on commercial work you

00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:28,960
could make your mark and you can make

00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:34,049
your mark in various different ways you

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,279
can do it through code you're sorry that

00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:38,559
yeah there's any number of different

00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:42,850
channels there's one single channel you

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:47,289
have to succeed in but look for those

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:49,649
opportunities because people want your

00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,649
help

00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:56,410
[Music]

00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:28,830
you're doing to participate

00:34:30,000 --> 00:35:27,820
embrace the experiences just bring your

00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:30,730
work the table is plenty these people

00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,500
who were new to WordPress and things

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,920
like the REST API and I think what is

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,320
that

00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:39,220
well the WordPress marketing team have

00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:42,820
done a glossary of all these terms which

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,860
if you look up the make marketing like

00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,690
wordpress.org even yeah I got it right

00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:49,300
I'll get in trouble for that

00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:53,080
and look up glossary we've just

00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:56,980
published that and we're trial stories

00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:58,900
like like Simon's so if you have a

00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,330
wordpress story if you've just a

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,890
passionate about what brought you to

00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:05,190
WordPress

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:07,560
come and talk to to me come and share

00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,990
your stories with Simon little

00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,890
conversations develop into big projects

00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:16,470
Simon I talked in London about two two

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:18,870
ideas that have come up about how we

00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,660
could celebrate WordPress 50th

00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,910
anniversary but actually reach out to

00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,240
people in communities that weren't being

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:29,130
reached to already and to help those

00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,300
people who felt a bit nervous about

00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:36,270
coming sharing so we've launched two

00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,720
campaigns one is about WordPress's and

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:41,400
their pets so you will start to see

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,950
appearing on the web a very lovely

00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,920
picture coming very shortly thanks to

00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:50,520
Amanda Webb who can't wait to people up

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:55,920
there and so if you are a word presser

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,930
and have a pet then the reason we have

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,180
cats is because Simon told me that we

00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:03,360
had to include cats so it was going to

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:06,090
be good job but on the positive we are

00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,400
using that to break down barriers we're

00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:11,220
using it to bring in communities that

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,650
aren't necessarily able to come and join

00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,870
us today we're also going to involve

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:19,140
some of the charities that work with

00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:22,770
assistance dogs as part of as part of

00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:25,740
that so you know if you think it you can

00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:27,720
actually dream it so and WordPress can

00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:31,860
make that happen by us all working

00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,660
together so a very very big thank you to

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,660
Simon we're hoping that Simon will be

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,940
able to to to input into our closing

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:43,560
remarks just in talking a little bit

00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,840
about the ecosystem in Ireland and say

00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,690

00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,210

00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:54,150
today with WordPress's all over the

00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,670
world and we have our very own apologies

00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:59,580
to muck but it's our very own state of

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:03,480
the word weather with the very amazing

00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:05,119
