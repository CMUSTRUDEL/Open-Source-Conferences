Title: Corey Maass: Build a Web App MVP with Little or No Code
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	WordPress is known to be a powerful and versatile tool for rapid proof-of-concept web app development.
During this WordCamp presentation, we will investigate why WordPress may be the best tool to help create your next web app. We will look at different examples of business cases where WordPress is the best option, and also where it falls short. I will illustrate how I have solved the most common UI patterns required by web apps using plugins, web resources and occasionally code.
We will walk through one of the apps Iâ€™ve built from idea to development to production to see the patterns in action. Finally, I share other considerations from my experience like deployment, syncing dev environments, AJAX, the REST API and iterating on feedback.
After the presentation, the audience will have a better understanding of WordPress for web app development. They will be ready to build a minimum viable product (MVP) web app on top of WordPress even if they have limited coding experience.

[Applause]

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,790
they can't walk and chew gum at the same

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:28,259
so as the gentleman said my name is

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:31,919
Corey Moss I've been developing forward

00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:35,760
on wet WordPress for about eight years

00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:39,769
now before that or including that I was

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,850
building focused on building sass apps

00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:45,539
software-as-a-service otherwise known as

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,769
web apps for about 15 years and I've

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,210
actually been building websites since

00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:54,390
we'll just say the mid 90s and leave it

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,399
at that my primary focus these days

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,059
aside from contract work building

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,609
websites for clients is a plug-in called

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,780
Kanban for WordPress you should check it

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,270
out so the goal for today we're going to

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,060
be talking about why you might build a

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,200
web app on WordPress and then we're

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,520
going to get into some of the common

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,260
patterns and problems that you might

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,700
encounter if you're trying to build a

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,380
web app my intent here is to address a

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,020
lot of the common problems and patterns

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,920
at a very high level and of a mile wide

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,600
inch deep scenario so I'm going to

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,700
mention a few plugins that I think would

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,820
help solve these problems or bits of

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,110
code that kind of thing

00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,670
come find me afterwards if you want to

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,080
dig into something deep but for the most

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,970
part again I'm just trying to give you a

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,210
big picture show you that it can be done

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,460
and how it can be done and then we'll go

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,320
into some other considerations they

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,159
might have of you know why or why not

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,149
you should use or

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,369
not use WordPress to build web apps so

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:03,520
to get a little context how many

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:05,950
developers have we got in the room so if

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,569
I say use the nonce we all know what I'm

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,230
talking about those guys go to timeout

00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:14,049
and gals yeah cool thank you all right

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,230
so why on earth would you build a web

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:19,390
app on WordPress Matt Mullenweg

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,860
our illustrious leader or one of them

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:26,410
anyway 2013 so now oh my goodness five

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,930
years ago in the state of the word

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,390
talking about different ways of how

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,930
WordPress was evolving going from

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:38,019
blogging to CMS introduced the idea of

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:41,610
using it even as a web app framework a

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:44,230
framework on which to build web apps and

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,819
they got me scratching my head because I

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,459
had been doing client work for a long

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:51,879
time building websites as we think of

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:54,549
them on WordPress but at nights and

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,599
weekends I'm building sass apps we'll

00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,560
talk a little bit about more than that

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,500
let us say for clients but using every

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,780
other framework and just hadn't occurred

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,000
to me to kind of combine the two

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,849
so this talk actually started a little

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,859
bit conceptually as a lot experiment of

00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:16,290
like could could I do this and in fact

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:18,489
could I do this without code and then

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,010
coincidentally this is now only a couple

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:25,810
years ago but wound up getting a client

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,849
who without any developer knowledge not

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,959
a nerd not like me

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:35,290
actually found a business case there's a

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,209
certain industry that was needed people

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,799
to fill out forms and then just needed

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,419
proof that they filled out those forms

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,220
and gdpr

00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:47,910
I think of it now but getting consent

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,590
that kind of thing and so he used

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,590
gravity forms to collect the data

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,209
gravity view to display the data he was

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,299
done and he was selling this

00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,430
successfully and hired me as a developer

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,549
developer to put a few polishing

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,209
finishes on it but it was very

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,209
enlightening to me

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,680
so some very specific reasons why why

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,450
you would use WordPress so let's start

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,660
with you know what is the sass app what

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,840
is a web app for me my background was I

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,840
was in New York going to a lot of boom

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,960
strapped startup meetups and

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,020
encountering people who again not nerds

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,419
had ideas because of course we live in

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,040
the age of you know build it in a month

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,840
later you'll sell it to Facebook for a

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,500
billion sadly I've never seen quick it

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,500
does happen

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,790
presumably but some people coming to me

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,919
and saying I've got an idea for you know

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,850
I want gluten-free people to be able to

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,190
enter and share recipes or I want to do

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,919
time tracking with for my company and

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:03,000
these little ideas that would make great

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,860
web apps and they come to me and this is

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,229
kind of again where the the germination

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,450
of this talk came from you've got these

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,700
ideas or you've got that uncle who gets

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:15,350
drunk at somebody's birthday party and

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,910
inevitably goes I have got a great idea

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,810
the best one I was ever pitched was an

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,750
online graveyard it was create a page

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,640
cake memorial that's not such a bad idea

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,640
but like basically whenever anybody

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,020
around you to creative age for them that

00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:38,789
would then live on forever

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:41,039
mmm-hmm okay he's had a bit to drink but

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:44,400
on a technical level some of the reasons

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,070
why you might use WordPress is that

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,400
again at a high level it it solves a lot

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,020
of the common problems when you start

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,820
thinking about an app you know most of

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,910
us are thinking about again you know who

00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,570
is who's the audience or maybe they're

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,550
dead you know you're not thinking about

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,200
sort of the same stuff that goes into

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,060
every

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,730
which is things like user management

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,970
login logout and I'll tell you from as a

00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:14,510
person who's been building apps since

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:16,910
2003 I have built a log in log that I if

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:20,510
I never have to build another password

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,820
reset page in my life I will die happy

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:26,330
these are just things that every app

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:29,360
means right rabbiting right you go to

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,490
slash contact and it shows a Contact Us

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,650
page which also brings us to display

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:40,120
content these are things that WordPress

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:40,120
is just naturally good at oh I miss

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:49,550
asterisks are for nerds so coming back

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,180
here common database schema I'll adjust

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,980
my my glasses here common database

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,400
schema is another great reason if you

00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:02,270
are a developer or even if you're not

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,160
building a web app on wordpress all your

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,920
data goes into a database in a logical

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,620
way so when you hire me because you've

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,780
made your first billion from Facebook I

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,170
can come in and go out I understand

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:19,640
immediately where all the data is so

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:23,990
some of the business cases of what kind

00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:27,440
of apps work well on WordPress and where

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,270
they don't good that business cases

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,420
things that are web-based things that

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,180
are user based right so in developer

00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,790
parlance we have a phrase called crud

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,730
create retrieve update and delete so

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:43,850
it's basically data in do something with

00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,680
the data retrieve the data update the

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,370
data if it gets out of date if they're

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,730
not dead and come back to life you might

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,490
want to update that order baby just

00:07:52,730 --> 00:08:00,290
delete it all together by being a little

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:02,870
more let's so some some good

00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,180
examples are if you're if you're

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:09,070
familiar with Yelp right leave reviews

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,070
for restaurants bars that kind of thing

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,320
recipe sites I always like

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,120
use that as an example because it's I've

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,300
come across it a shocking number of

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,120
times I don't know that you can sell it

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,010
but they are lots of fun right community

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,880
sites where you want people to interact

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:29,550
with each other and LMS learning systems

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,410
people take courses and move forward

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,920
that kind of thing

00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,270
the bad use cases if you've got an idea

00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,060
where you're like I'm gonna move

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:43,890
financial information you know machine

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:45,510
to machine API or press not so much and

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,580
if you're doing something that requires

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,410
a lot a lot of writings and caught you

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,710
know if you open the firehose of

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:55,020
Twitter's API and try to point it in a

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,030
wordpress database that database is

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,620
going to fall over deck and then you

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:03,320
could create a page on that web app that

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:06,540
I described but not such a good idea for

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,480
building your web app on WordPress so

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,160
the examples that I mentioned are

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,070
something like SendGrid which is meant

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,890
for sending transactional emails or

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,060
stripe which is for moving financial or

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,530
money back and forth things like that

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,280
WordPress probably not the framework for

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:29,280
you so moving on to some basic common

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,910
patterns of your your standard

00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,590
quote/unquote standard web app right got

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,720
a home page this is you know where you

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,350
push everybody and that's usually tied

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,420
to some other marketing pages use cases

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:44,850
you know buy my app or use my app or

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,870
share my app that kind of thing

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:53,040
Contact Us page your app is broken or my

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,810
uncle is not dead and then where we get

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,330
into the meat of it which is you know

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,360
you want users to register and then

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,610
sometime later log in again right to see

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,380
their data they're probably going to see

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,010
some sort of dashboard I use dashboard

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,010
circle

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:18,489
please stand by get excited

00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:22,229
sign in you know now there are ways to

00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:26,439
interact with data data tied to them and

00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:28,149
their so again who's your crud it's

00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:33,159
probably going to create you're gonna

00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:34,809
view retrieve and and I do a little you

00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,819
know dotted line up to because sometimes

00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:38,829
that view data is public compute again

00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:40,599
if you have a recipe site you want

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:42,399
people to be able to find those recipes

00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:46,689
publicly without necessarily having to

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,649
sign in maybe and then the other piece

00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:52,059
that a lot of us don't think about is

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,319
basically happening how are you going to

00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,759
manage users how are you're going to

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,109
track users how are you gonna learn

00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,789
about your users see what they're

00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:59,499
creating and all that stuff without

00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:01,029
signing in and signing out and this is

00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:03,279
one of those things that when I was

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:06,009
building web apps by hand or using other

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,779
frameworks they don't come with an admin

00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,179
necessarily so I'm still building these

00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:13,209
extra screens where I'm like open view

00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:17,379
all users or view all recipes that all

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:18,879
users entered whereas in WordPress this

00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,829
might be the thing that we are all the

00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,379
most familiar with if you're familiar

00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:25,779
with WordPress at all is signing in and

00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:27,849
you see an admin right and you've got if

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,589
you're using you know custom post types

00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:31,419
or whatever it is you're seeing the

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:34,509
different things your forums or your

00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,309
customers as users when you sign in so

00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:45,249
again a huge win that this is already

00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:50,589
built into WordPress so solving each one

00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:53,189
of these pieces one at a time talk

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:53,189
amongst yourself

00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:00,500
now we'll solve each one of these right

00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,459
so you've got a home page marketing

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,269
pages highest level WordPress comes with

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:12,589
a beautiful theme the new theme 2017

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:15,110
right is actually more business oriented

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:17,300
that it's ever been where you've got a

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:21,500
dedicated homepage rather than it being

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,360
presented as a blog so honestly right

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,310
out of the box you've got a home page

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,410
tweak it a little bit and there's the

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:31,639
home page for your app right if you want

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:36,910
to dig in a little deeper page builders

00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:40,310
are great pimpin Williamson who is a

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:43,160
thought leader blogger prominent

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:46,670
personality in the WordPress ecosystem

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,810
wrote a phenomenal blog post a couple of

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,610
years I don't know 9,000 words 20,000

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,879
words huge book he basically wrote it

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,420
book reviewing I don't know the top

00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:03,050
dozen page builders a couple that I

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,829
recommend beaver builder good guys for

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:08,569
community

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:11,149
Elementor huge community Divi starts to

00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:12,860
overlap with with page builders but

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,630
basically what's what you know this lets

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,310
you start with a blank slate and build

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,980
the homepage the way you envision it

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:21,980
again without having to write code and

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,870
then a member asterisks are for nerds if

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,959
you do know a little bit of code or a

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,790
lot of code and want to spin up a home

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,920
page very quickly because again the idea

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,089
here is got an idea you want to get it

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,160
out into the world as quickly as

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:37,130
possible there are these front-end

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,949
frameworks libraries bootstrap

00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:44,120
foundation just real quick for for

00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:46,279
spinning out the home pages the next

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:51,019
piece contact us write every website

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:53,059
needs to contact us no code at all form

00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:55,970
builders things like ninja forms gravity

00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,500
forms great options nice UI so you're

00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,870
dragging and dropping to create your

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,280
fields something like ninja forms

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,990
actually

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,020
it comes with it built-in when you would

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,430
when you activate it the first time

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,980
excuse me Creed's the contact us page

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:13,300
has all the functionality set up right

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,430
away to send you an email one of the

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,290
things that has been growing to over the

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,530
last couple years is that there are now

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,960
a lot of add-ons for these these form

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,670
builders that can add extra

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,340
functionality and again I'm starting to

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,290
see more people that are coming closer

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,570
even to building web apps just for the

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,840
the what's built into these these for

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,160
builders so you've got you know somebody

00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,770
fills out a form and you can basically

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,980
push them into a sales funnel drip

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:44,920
campaigns or you're using something like

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,210
a zapier makes you have here that's how

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,820
you remember how to pronounce it so

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,800
zapier but basically is a service that

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,290
you can tie into again just using

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,420
plugins that can talk to all these

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,430
different systems so you can collect an

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,510
email and then push it into other apps

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:04,420
and things like that and then again in

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:09,940
master it says for nerds we introduced

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:12,700
this pattern called post that loops so

00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,860
let's talk a little bit about that this

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,160
is mostly for the Nerds or aspiring

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,570
nerds in the room the rest of you look

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,570
up the window or something in convention

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,940
we've got a decent view anyway so a very

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,620
simple pattern here for for building web

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,710
apps and against this this does require

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,080
some code but it took me a while to kind

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:41,740
of distill this down in my head so I

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,780
like to show it to people in case they

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,060
haven't quite got a grasp on it because

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,370
this is this is so powerful and honestly

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,250
internally this is a little thing in

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:55,000
obviously all the you know all of

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:58,630
WordPress but but extremely powerful is

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,190
you have some sort of form for a user to

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,800
interact with right and forms are

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,450
crucial for interaction it's how we

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,370
collect most of the data this is what

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,290
change the internet yes

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,740
enough to remember this this changed the

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,819
internet from read to write right

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,649
because originally you were just reading

00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:16,059
stuff and you couldn't interact with it

00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:20,559
and suddenly there were forms and you

00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:21,129
could so basically get a form onto a web

00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,850
page

00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:27,519
somehow whether it's writing HTML or

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,740
using a form builder or whatever and

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,839
then that form includes this is where we

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,889
get a little nerdy WordPress has a

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,889
function called WP nonce nonce field WP

00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,959
whatever it is it Knox field where it

00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,689
adds a little secret key to your form

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,059
right and then when somebody submits

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:47,889
that form and it gets sent to the

00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:50,050
website you add a little bit of code

00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:51,550
that listens for that nonce and that's

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,769
how you know that that form has been

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,139
submitted you kind of know what data to

00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:57,910
expect and then you can do something

00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:01,509
with it again this is this is writing

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:03,970
code but the ability to create a page

00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:06,159
with a form on by adding your little

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,169
nonce you add a little little code that

00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:10,720
listens for that nonce and so you create

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,039
this cycle where you can collect data do

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,770
something with it stick it in the

00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:17,039
database send an email whatever send

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:20,740
them back to that forum send them to the

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,529
output of that form and start all over

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,529
again and this from from a app

00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:29,049
development standpoint was huge this was

00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:30,940
basically what I wanted using for most

00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:34,809
of the functionality because again most

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:36,669
web apps broadly speaking our collection

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,559
of data and then displaying of data so

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:40,840
this is this was huge so the post back

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:45,429
loop will will show its rear assembly

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,890
head a few times later in this top so

00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:50,890
again moving on to the next piece user

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:55,539
registration and login coming back out a

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:56,830
nerd land membership plugins basically

00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,830
the weather can tell people here is

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,390
Google WordPress membership plugins it's

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:05,470
as simple as that but there are so many

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:08,020
of them that is that it's getting harder

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,679
and harder to recommend them I mean one

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,340
is literally

00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,019
membership restricted content pro as one

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,720
put out by that guy at Pippin that I

00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:19,929
mentioned s two members one that I've

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,600
come across a bunch of times and what

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:25,450
this will do is basically take that that

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,669
WordPress user registration form and

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,129
push it to the front so now you've got

00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,869
and what looks more like a web app and

00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:35,110
less like somebody signing into a

00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:37,779
WordPress website a lot of these will

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,399
even include payment options and so if

00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:42,190
you want to charge for your app five

00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:44,200
bucks a month whatever it is there's

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,749
options for that or there's add-ons for

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,570
that the one piece of advice that I will

00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:51,070
I will give is please please please it's

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,869
a little harder when you're not in the

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:59,039
US but it's still doable always use

00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:59,039
stripe as a payment processor not PayPal

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,009
then the next option is huge user

00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:13,509
registration plugins which are basically

00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:15,399
include general s functionality where it

00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:16,899
doesn't necessarily include all of the

00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:19,749
bells and whistles of a full membership

00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:22,269
suite what this does is again basically

00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:25,480
just push that the the sign up or sign

00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:27,220
in forms to the front end so that they

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,139
they look a little more consistent with

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:36,279
your app again Google WordPress front

00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:38,970
end either registration or profile one

00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:43,509
of my absolute favorite things that I

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,220
stumbled across early on is a lot of

00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:49,269
people grumble and groan especially

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:52,149
developers about social login but the

00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:55,990
truth is is people like my mom who I

00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:57,159
considered a normal user loves social

00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,600
login right

00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,369
one-click she's already signed in

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,259
through Facebook or one-click she's not

00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:04,210
on Twitter but you get the idea

00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:06,639
well one click and there so there's a

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:09,940
there's a plugin that i think is

00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:12,580
literally called social login but you

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,620
install this plug-in and now users can

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,640
with one click and when we're talking

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:20,350
about MVPs when we're talking about a

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,300
proof-of-concept web app you're just

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,790
trying to get users in you want as

00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:28,530
little friction as possible so something

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:30,880
like social login is is a great option

00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,490
then getting a get back then soothes

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,340
nerd speak you can use there's there's

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,880
simple functions built into WordPress to

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:42,070
display the login page you can also use

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,690
a form like we talked about and again

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,480
that post back lumen for signing

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,130
somebody again and then when a new

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,130
pattern I've been seeing more of is

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,890
people actually using multi-site and so

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,570
instead of having one WordPress site

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,060
where different people signing in or

00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,730
created as users they've actually sort

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:05,940
of cobbled it together that different

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:10,030
people can see a get it get their own

00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,800
WordPress install and then we need to

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,480
protect the admin right you don't want

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,160
anybody ever you want to just get in and

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,380
see these dashboards they need to be

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,080
able to sign in so again the membership

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,970
plugins there are plugins that are

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,860
specifically dedicated to restricting

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,700
the admin this is usually based on user

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:30,520
role and then again the three lines of

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,380
code you can basically create a rule

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,560
based redirect so in the template you

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,990
can say if you are not a subscriber user

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,130
whatever redirect them back to the

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:44,830
homepage same idea protecting specific

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,000
pages so like that view data tab that I

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,890
showed you

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,350
membership plugins again have it built

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,870
in constricted content plugins have it

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:58,120
built in and that's saying old base to

00:21:52,870 --> 00:22:00,180
drive now for capturing data you've got

00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,360
again you've got these form builders

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:07,140
poor that are getting easier and easier

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,150
but how do you store all that data well

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:15,310
there are plugins that basically will

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:18,340
manage creating custom post types which

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:21,920
is you know your object your recipe and

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,400
then adding custom fields and there

00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,140
I'm a big fan of advanced custom fields

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,870
there are others I should have other

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,960
names but basically this will lets you

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,790
say okay so associated with a recipe art

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,060
ingredients and so that you can have

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,800
multiple ingredients or you know who who

00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,160
wrote this originally or what book could

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,040
you find this in Betty Crocker whatever

00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:49,910
and then again we introduce or we post

00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,800
back week so then displaying data this

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,130
is what an example I mentioned earlier

00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:58,910
of I had a client that was using gravity

00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:02,450
forms to collect data and there's a sort

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:04,610
of a parallel plugin called gravity view

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:08,170
that is exactly built for displaying

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:12,680
that form data so form viewers are great

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:15,530
page builders are surprisingly good at

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,390
taking data out of the database and

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,430
displaying it back to you soon these

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,350
days you can actually custom build what

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,180
you want that that dashboard running

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:27,050
again when I started this talk a few

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:29,390
years ago you were kind of limited on

00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:32,540
how you could display that data back now

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:35,300
you can actually take the advanced

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:39,500
custom fields and have that data show

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,420
right in that page builder layout so

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:46,670
it's beautiful it's nice and laid out

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:49,880
it's not clunky at all those bad mood so

00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,410
just to review real quick you've got a

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,730
home page sorry I was trying to state

00:23:51,410 --> 00:24:00,920
that my home page and other marketing

00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:04,520
pages page builder themes right contact

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,560
us use the form builder login

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,500
registration there are dedicated plugins

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:13,430
that will handle user registration and

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:15,470
use her membership next you're signed

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,390
into your app so now you can see it and

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:21,770
here you can basically build custom

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:23,510
pages that are will display data or

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,210
collect data and again you can use

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,179
something a form builder or a page

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:32,049
builder to accomplish this

00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:33,909
that about and then those membership

00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:35,409
plugins or there are other plugins that

00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:38,710
will let you protect your adamant butt

00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:40,480
so that you can sign in and see see how

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,700
your app is performing see how your

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:48,429
users are doing and using it that kind

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,990
of thing other considerations things

00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:54,460
that you might fight with and things

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:57,899
that you might worry about from a

00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:03,549
developer standpoint if you do get into

00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:04,779
writing code to keep things simple every

00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:07,269
developer I talked a little bit about

00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:09,789
this yesterday my other talk every

00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:11,169
developer most developers struggle with

00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:14,039
a thing called not invented here

00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:17,619
syndrome if I didn't write it as

00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,950
inferior it is not as good because I am

00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:22,809
genius I suffered from this most

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,090
developers suffer from this we are wrong

00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:29,409
there's almost always somebody smarter

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:33,369
than we are and what's amazing is we

00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:36,249
live in this age of github and open

00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:37,869
source for a wordpress we're these very

00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:40,840
smart people and the kindness of their

00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:43,059
hearts and put it all online so the love

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,509
of god use it use other people's code

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:50,009
when they've solved a problem try it at

00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:55,749
least don't write it from scratch and

00:25:50,009 --> 00:26:00,460
where possible keep it simple stupid or

00:25:55,749 --> 00:26:03,340
Leventis right use themes use built-in

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:07,179
functionality and then where you need to

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:10,600
again this very simple pattern of a form

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,700
to collect data that submits data and

00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,740
you do something with it and that way it

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:19,720
just keeps you writing as little code as

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:22,450
possible some development considerations

00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,629
you've got these things that this thing

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,190
called WP CLI which is like deep nerd

00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,509
where you're in terminal and it looks

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,169
like you're the matrix or something

00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:34,860
right if you know it great if you don't

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:37,389
know it don't bother learn it later

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,580
because again our goal here is to spin

00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:45,960
things up as fast as possible

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:48,330
using Tyler's like run gulp webpack are

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,890
great again sort of sort of the point of

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,780
this slide I guess is if you already

00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,600
know it great use it because again the

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,490
point of speed you're just trying to get

00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,830
you know an idea out into the world as

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,540
fast as possible so that people will try

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:07,920
this thing and tell you that it's genius

00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:09,270
or terrible No and then we're headless

00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,460
WordPress and this is where you got into

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,870
it doesn't actually show anything but

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:18,590
you can use a lot of the code on the

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:18,590
backend it tends to speed things up but

00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:34,350
my little reminder to close my eyes for

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:36,000
20 seconds you gotta hack yourself right

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,010
so I'm a little happy that like it shuts

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,380
down my computer for 20 seconds so that

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:43,590
I stop staring at my screen into the day

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,610
stretch this is the yoga that we think

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:51,300
is supposed to be right

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:54,930
genuine and then deployment this this

00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,940
isn't this is a tricky one because you

00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:59,610
know however you're building your your

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,130
web app code or no code you've gotta get

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,950
it out there and there are a lot of

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:07,020
great hosting solutions now that will

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:11,790
give you with one-click and wordpress

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:13,260
install and what I recommend in this

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,900
scenario where again you're trying to

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,560
work quickly is it's just do it all in

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,500
one place

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,330
just cowboy at work on the server these

00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,570
are blasphemous statements I realized

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,310
from the perspective of a developer but

00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,250
again for the sake of just getting it

00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:32,160
done do what you gotta do and then there

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,840
are other solutions like deploy HQ which

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,920
will take any local code if you're

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,870
developing on your low

00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,640
you know and this like I'm here coding

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,940
on this website or this computer and

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,720
then I need to push it to the server

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,950
solutions like that will do it

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,560
automatically

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:49,050
FTP obviously I should have a why that's

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,870
all on the slide and then plugins like

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:54,780
WP migrate Divi Pro that will synced

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,150
databases so ones because inevitably you

00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,280
build the thing you get it online and

00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,080
then now because customers are

00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,050
interacting with it you need another

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,970
staging environment something so that

00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:09,030
you can make changes without it breaking

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,850
for your users and that's where synching

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,290
starts to become a little tricky and so

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:17,210
you're using a plug-in like this to

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,210
manage it becomes a good option

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:25,890
nice-to-haves again if your developer

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:30,600
supremo then you can get into things

00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:32,700
like ajax rest api's and building things

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,820
pretty and custom API is and all that

00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,000
stuff but the truth is is and and I've

00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:41,730
heard this from so many people with

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,190
ideas right they're like I need the best

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:46,290
user experience and I get it and so they

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,810
want seamless and like you click and the

00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:50,520
page doesn't refresh it just kind of you

00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,680
know does funky little things and all

00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,650
that stuff you generally don't need that

00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,240
to prove a business case right you're

00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,310
collecting the recipe you're displaying

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,960
the recipe that's enough it doesn't have

00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,900
to fly around the page or it would be

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,250
the prettiest to prove the concept so a

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:10,770
lot of this stuff you know

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:15,270
save it for version zero zero two there

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:18,060
we go finishing my my talk here once

00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:20,310
again I'm in court if you have questions

00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,750
we'll do some that obviously but feel

00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:26,070
free to email me I'm kind of an email

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:26,520
guy but you can also tweet out take your

00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,799
badge

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,799
