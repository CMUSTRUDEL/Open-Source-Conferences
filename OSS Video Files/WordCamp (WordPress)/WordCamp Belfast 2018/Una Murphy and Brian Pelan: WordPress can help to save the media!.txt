well thank you very much for coming

00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,619
today oh no it's nearly the end of the

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,850
day and everyone's very very tired but

00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,709
what I was very surprised that my talk

00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,199
about how WordPress would save the media

00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:20,150
was actually selected I come here on a

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,830
bit of a back foot but absolutely

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,650
delighted to be involved with the

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,770
WordPress community and I hope to do

00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,870
more in the future as well my name is

00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,970
una Murphy and this is Fran Palin and

00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,920
together with quite a few decades

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,649
experience of journalism in the

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,999
mainstream media in broadcasting of work

00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:43,609
for BBC TV RTE over the years producing

00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:46,550
news current affairs documentaries and

00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:48,589
brand came to view digital as a

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,219
production journalist also as a feature

00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:54,229
writer and together we've combined to

00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,989
work on a digital first product which

00:00:54,229 --> 00:01:00,710
goes out in the form of a magazine a

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:43,310
digital magazine and stories and

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:46,130
community issues which are appended my

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,960
generation were terrified at the sight

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,910
of the release and outside a network

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,140
where I thought the word of actually

00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,610
publishing what the Contin our

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,540
responsibility and price yet with the

00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,940
concept of publishing the accident

00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,250
of publishing and publishing your

00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,530
information to an audience with all the

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,840
checks and balances of germs and the

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,670
responsibility was something that I just

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,380
couldn't resist I'm still dying and

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,240
doing it but they actually know that I'm

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:18,940
WordPress gave us to be able to do it

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:21,040
without it so currently we're a member

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,690
of a newsie UK steering body which is

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,000
called the independent community news

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,950
network and it's basically the impetus

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,410
came from Cardiff University in Wales

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,180
where I study for a master's over 20

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,220
years ago and had the opportunity to go

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,620
back to my old journalism school and to

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,690
be part of a new exciting genre which is

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,320
community journalism we're not rooted

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,400
with Murdoch

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,320
we don't have loads of money in our

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,420
pockets but we are part of the community

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,340
as everyone else's and we want to do

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,470
journalism for the benefit of our

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,450
community so just now I we've been

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,070
selected to be part of the BBC local

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,230
news partnership and that means we

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,180
receive stories that we can't get to

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,640
ourselves local council stories and

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,320
Derry health and education boards

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,360
throughout Northern Ireland and it means

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,750
we have more content to put on our news

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,050
site so we're a social enterprise we've

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,459
gone along the non profit more model

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,739
because as I say we're not look like

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,230
Murdoch and the type of journalism that

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:16,720
we do I think works in the sort of

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:22,209
community social enterprise type of

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:27,310
Malou so if you wanted to have a look at

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:31,150
our website to it it's it's a wordpress

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,970
website where we keep our magazines

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,239
primarily so as I say we're digital

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,500
first but for most dish receive edition

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,390
where we looked at maternal mental

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,100
health we were scandalized to find that

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,900
there's not one specialist mother and

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,850
baby unit on the whole of the island of

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,190
Ireland if a mother experiences

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,040
psychiatric problems during pregnancy or

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,140
after the birth so we thought that would

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,090
be very good to work with a campaigner

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,300
in the local community to highlight that

00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,300
issue

00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,709
and number of versions anheuser-busch

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,079
tonight is a woman who needed it we may

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,689
be familiar with Edie why do you use at

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,370
pubs upon hang over weekend

00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:14,989
nearly lost to normal holy Shi and

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,880
trying that during the week were fine

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,000
what about the begins to get support the

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,810
weekend so I said that said I couldn't

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,520
do that again

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,020
but I'd accomplished it Atlanta she

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,470
performance in there that took care of

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,930
me

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:32,150
it's what swirling to reopen so when it

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:34,669
began when t issue and that yeah hits

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:41,599
where should basically have the magazine

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:44,180
as publishers okay so it's all mine

00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,310
basically and the thing that we're still

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,190
work on the bottle is what you see

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,500
printed is kind of what you see online

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,090
but with given resources where the

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,099
Penguins for that I would build it up

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,259
from not from before started off this

00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:59,479
magazine I've never done twenty first

00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:01,669
issue with the Senate to yeah make it a

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:04,280
faint magazine before we don't reinjure

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,889
stories should- magazine is like a

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,509
single thing and every not magazine is

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:13,430
what that thing a lot you can see an

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:16,070
average length of the historical

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:22,639
thinking the other story so that that's

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:24,800
the magazine so we also print the

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,780
magazine and distribute it ruined free

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,550
to all the libraries in Northern Ireland

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,169
and increasing into the Republic of

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,349
Ireland Dublin City Library

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:36,080
all their periodical section will have

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:37,430
copies if you go to the ilyich Center in

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,669
Dublin you'll see it in the business

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,340
section and Trinity College National

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,810
Library of Ireland as well as all the

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,000
libraries in Northern Ireland take a

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,180
free printed copy because we still

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,979
believe in libraries that's a great open

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,310
source for information as well as

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:58,400
WordPress so we're very passionate about

00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,400
the idea of overcoming the Democratic

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,039
deficit deficit when it comes to media

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,320
because we believe that the means of

00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,900
production are in everyone's pocket

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,219
nowadays when it comes to content and we

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,460
as professional journalists want to

00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:15,100
connect the community we live in

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,800
to produce really interesting journalism

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,390
accounts

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,570
so basically we're part of the whole

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:26,140
sphere that people do this across the UK

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,450
and Ireland Bristol cable the ferric and

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,000
Scotland there are other examples of

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,650
similar community media organisations

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,900
who are also part of the independent

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:39,840
community news network and that's just a

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,720
few other front covers so we cover

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:48,640
topics use from prisons to justice to

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:50,680
child poverty suicide were we really

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,870
felt passionately as journalists that

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,900
the social affairs are not well covered

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,060
in this community which is you know

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,430
we'll spend a lot of our time talking

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,410
about politicians here not installment

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,000
and we thought that we need to get back

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,860
to the community and talk about some of

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
the stuff this the stories that kind and

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:21,510
some of the people who are really

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:24,400
campaigning to improve things here say

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:26,830
social worker academic that she's a very

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,930
professional you will possibly read our

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,760
magazine nothing you will you will of an

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,950
interest in and or you've been in fact

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,530
at my age you should say so that's about

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,780
magazines are like wave Andorian

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,110
specifically who will be interested not

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,940
popping in subject and they did 32 pages

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,430
constitutive journalist a moment it

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,800
builds our profile up as well so since

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,840
we start doing it and to where we are

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,950
now a number of people actually

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,780
approaches night

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,390
- what collaborative a post position

00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,760
magazine so it's got that Steve Knight

00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:03,550
we have plans for the future but that's

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,020
kind of where we are so business I said

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,790
we used it as a shop front for the

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,970
magazine first of all but now when I

00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,950
producing regular stories and you know

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,810
put in the most as well as put in the

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,060
most recent edition of the magazine and

00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,870
so the the type of stories that we've

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:22,180
been put for them most recently was a

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,150
review of a controversial play but

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,440
identity and loyalist identity which was

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,150
on the mark Steven

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,780
the star that's going on to New York

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:37,150
cause a better discussion locally

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:39,220
violently and Robert Redford son was

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,720
discussed in Derry City Council the

00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,909
other day who would believe it but he's

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,490
been just a really interesting film to

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:49,930
help kids overcome trauma and early

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,790
childhood and healthy social services in

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,320
Derry were trying to convince the local

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,110
council that it should be introduced

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,270
into all the schools and we thought it

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,160
was a really nice photograph a really

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,590
nice story so we also got a photograph

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,170
of Robert Redford other son to go along

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,120
with 200 words on it but I think

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,340
fundamentally what we need to do is test

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,850
out how we can finance journalism

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,560
properly what we're doing is tricky it's

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,090
different from what we're used to

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,040
working in the mainstream media

00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,570
most other journalists who work in the

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,950
mainstream media don't have to fund

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,260
themselves before they can do the

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:26,160
journalism but that's exactly the model

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,360
that we've had to undertaken with the

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,370
magazine so we've tested like different

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,500
ways of financing and getting different

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:36,180
revenue models so we've had sponsored

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,310
pages in the magazine we do ancillary

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:43,180
services like production we make videos

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:45,000
for other people usually charities we do

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,650
help people communicate their stories

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,510
digital and traditional media and we

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,460
sometimes do some consultancy for

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,590
charities when they ask and we've just

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,690
introduced a new view champion member

00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,930
scheme so it's like a membership scheme

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:02,620
people who want to back journalism and

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,330
at a diluted Rupert Murdoch couldn't

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,270
maybe talk about some of the resources

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:10,470
towards us and we actually produced a

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,000
short video which brand is the star in

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,360
if you'd like to show that you can link

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,360
on the

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,030
[Music]

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:34,390
oh yeah and the wordpress is key I mean

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,430
recently has the same what your father

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,390
did WordPress phenomenal just a

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,770
phenomenal tool industry okay at the end

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,570
you have to pay for way up to beat the

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,760
peace to be boosted accept the potential

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,830
that product itself and I came from a

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,980
French arms about that I had never

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,790
worked we are due to technology it was

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:58,330
my fact that everything was cheaper and

00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:00,850
typewriters and natto and telephones and

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,820
people smoking in the nutrients table to

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,160
cultures and newsroom an an important

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,670
computer Tunisian care fell silent and

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,220
the culture can change police will say

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:44,550
one thing about the old days you never

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:47,840
lost a story you know you never say

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,840
[Music]

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:12,010
Japan the ones in my sector that I'll be

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,200
tough to but I don't put a bunch on that

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,170
it anything from now I've got a dozen

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,580
bit busy and that's what happens because

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,079
solar stuff that you use you see the

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,029
doors you push the floor Agassi

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,420
this lot more to WordPress than that and

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,100
plugins and as we develop I would only

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,130
like to have a web developer actually

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,440
attached to the organization and

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,389
freelance but preferably start something

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:45,639
moves a lot more than me up like this

00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:47,380
behind utilize all of these so the

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,630
reason that we need to support good the

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,800
organism is probably illustrated in the

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:55,990
next slide where the woman on the right

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,589
exposed what the man on the left was

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:02,410
doing on my right your left

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:03,220
but she's my hero and he's not and he

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,990
makes all the money

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,190
and the Guardian will put an appeal at

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,050
the end of the page so and please

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,940
support us please support us and you

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,699
know I feel very guilty but I don't so

00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,250
it's not a good effective business model

00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:16,779
to support journalism so what we thought

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,880
about and what we were looking at in

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:22,660
terms of research moving forward is hi

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,639
you could actually pay for a fraction of

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,069
a penny for the articles that you read

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,589
on the website and we're very interested

00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:33,459
to look at the etherium platform with

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:35,740
the blockchain technology which

00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:38,019
obviously is where Bitcoin comes from

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,970
and if everyone was to pay a fraction of

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:41,889
a penny for an article when they read it

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,240
how'd that work out you know well

00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:45,850
obviously this is blue sky thinking

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,680
because we're a small community media

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,750
social enterprise you know in terms of

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,550
resources it's not something that we can

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,500
vary it readily decide oh let's get the

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,990
R&D team to have a look at this simple

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,910
because that's us and we have to do the

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,010
journalism but you know what if you

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,279
could link in the open source of the

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:06,130
WordPress with the open source of the

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,170
caesarian platform and users blocked in

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,930
technology for every one of our readers

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:14,170
and like 10,000 people could get a few

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,029
pennies for us you know to read the

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,550
content on the website because why we

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,709
can monetize the magazine well with the

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,389
sponsorship it's a little bit trickier

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:25,540
we fund because everything is free in

00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:27,610
the internet to actually you know get a

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,430
good business model around the news on

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,800
the new site so we thought that we would

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,040
look at civil which is a new publishing

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,350
platform launched and

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,680
Americans spray and to see what they

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:42,649
were up to so they are going to be using

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,839
you know aetherium tokens like an

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,029
offshoot of Bitcoin and it's going to be

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,800
the creation of a new media economy and

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:51,290
we're obviously saying what's that space

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,779
because that's possibly where it could

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,459
be going you know people could be

00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:57,620
incentivized once we get over being

00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:00,139
afraid of cryptocurrency and you know

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,120
the black dark web and all the boogeyman

00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,680
sort of idea about it you know if we

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,060
could all pay a little quarter of a

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,730
penny towards reading a bit of

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,370
journalism it's mud might make a good

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:13,279
business money for us so this is just a

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,769
little audio clip of the guy from civil

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,690
code not cold bridge where he talks a

00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:29,509
little bit about you know what he's

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:31,519
trying to do if any and the black - okay

00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:33,319
well so business explain in the

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,970
background - but if they're setting up

00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:37,339
little news hubs around the states at

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,760
the moment and they're all going to be

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:42,980
blocked in technology so you know in in

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,050
terms of saving your content you know if

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,550
your website goes down and you just lose

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,380
all your content that's not going to

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,720
happen anymore because it's all going to

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,190
be saved in different computers and I'm

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,000
not a techie so I don't know the in

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:58,970
tonight's about but we did discover this

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,649
one micropayment platform was it a

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,380
wordpress plugin which would like to

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,899
look at a little bit more and physically

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,860
their launch and experiment with digital

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:12,680
micropayments

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:14,120
- you know can - that we're looking at

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,130
it to sort of validate whether it's

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,189
something are we could be using whether

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:21,560
it could you know get our readers to pay

00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:23,779
a little bit for the journalism that

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,850
they read on our website without invest

00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,800
in significant capital and there's

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:32,529
already been one example of it across

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,529
the water next slide

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,520
so the this tech news website is just

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:47,560
just said this month that they're going

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:51,940
to be using this particular payment of

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,560
of digital currency and to pay for some

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,630
of the digital content that they produce

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,610
on its website so we think it's very

00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,110
interesting development I don't know if

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,850
it's going to go anywhere beyond that

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,350
but we think it's good way to think

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,930
about the business model around to

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,010
support and good journalism and whether

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,170
you know these are the sort of

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,630
monetization schemes that we should be

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,580
looking at in the future and I mean we

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,550
do need to think about monetization of

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:18,000
the media unless you always want to run

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,380
the risk of having fake news on Facebook

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,700
potentially overthrowing democratic

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:27,010
elections by the Russians you know are

00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,720
these are things that we are gone to say

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,880
is okay in the future should we be going

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,310
back to your media which is actually

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,400
helping democracy not hindering

00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:39,280
democracy so therefore monetizing

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,560
publishing is important in terms of

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,020
overcoming the Democratic deficit not

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,220
Northern Ireland not in UK not new

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,530
public funding but perhaps worldwide and

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,810
that's why we believe that WordPress can

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,970
save the media because I think it has a

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:59,610
vital role potentially in the future to

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:03,060
helping us monetize journalism properly

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,060
