	00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:10,410
so we need to do a quick talk just about

00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:14,290
this project that we did very recently I

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,020
jumped I think it started in autumn I

00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:21,340
jumped in in January and this was a

00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:25,419
project to develop a couple of sixes and

00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,430
resources for WordPress core so this was

00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:29,619
our roadmap we cannot hit WordPress

00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,450
sites to clients but we can provide site

00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:33,520
administrators and users with the tools

00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,370
they need to help them bring their sites

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,050
into healthy compliance any given

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,690
WordPress site this combination of core

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,310
and plugins and themes and no to our

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,740
life there's different ways of they're

00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,440
capturing information processing it and

00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,260
sharing it and we can't save people from

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,020
themselves all we could do was deal with

00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,710
core and also the same mindset a best

00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,630
practice example others to follow so we

00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,989
were working towards Friday's deadline

00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:04,059
of gdpr and to that definition but

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,130
throughout the journey we did discover

00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,890
various other issues that are equally

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,690
important as general privacy principles

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,290
but didn't necessarily fit into that

00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,400
rubric of GPR so we've sort of

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,630
bookmarked all those issues and held

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,060
those thoughts that we're now going to

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,070
start coming back to so that was our

00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,409
roadmap we did have a few constraints

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,659
for this project number one as I said we

00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,430
cannot make WordPress sites compliant we

00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:30,580
can only deal put a couple of things in

00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,040
core no tool achieves compliance in and

00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,619
of itself GPR is about your business

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
processes it's about how do you work

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,860
internally how you collect information

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,450
and process it I mean sheriff how you

00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,729
train your staff how you delete the

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,820
information you can't automate that and

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:48,430
no tool removes the users responsibility

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,680
for compliance everyone wants the magic

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,670
plug-in everyone wants to put the

00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,220
buttons

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,470
it's not how it works so we were very

00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,810
very keen to keep it about personal

00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,670
responsibility while giving people the

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,740
tools they needed so that they didn't

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,860
have to be developers or lawyers or both

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,540
I always tell people there's no such

00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,270
thing as compliance there's no such ins

00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,459
maybe being GDR compliant it is only the

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,590
best practice journey a quickest way to

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:17,440
fall out of compliance is to think you

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:21,280
are it's about how you do things every

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,930
day every week in your month I encourage

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,000
people to even put calendar reminders

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,880
like every three months just renew our

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,860
processes look at what we're doing so we

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,870
steered away from anything that actually

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,310
offered compliance even though you kind

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,550
of had to say called it beauty beyond

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,440
compliance for lack of a better term it

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,450
was it was a hard sell because the

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,470
WordPress project as a whole is allergic

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,840
to anything legal it is an international

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,870
border this project so you can really

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,730
work to any one set of legal rules or

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,459
restrictions or constraints it's also

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,110
very alertly in American dominated and a

00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,530
lot of American developers don't want to

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,660
deal with politics or law in any regard

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,269
but the way sell the project was to sell

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:08,739
again about best practice not about

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:11,470
taking a European box and to be fair no

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,660
open source CMS project has given CPR or

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,220
privacy really proper resourcing they

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,660
are now I'm speaking me to do the

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,209
conference next weekend about this

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,000
project so we were sort of the least

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:25,329
worst which is kind of a backhanded

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,340
compliment but nobody really got on this

00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:34,150
as they should have but we did the post

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:36,160
I just repeated we had four aims to the

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,610
project number one was to add tools to

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,470
court

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,110
so take compliance and privacy in

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,290
general number two add tools for

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,270
creating a privacy policy number three

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,520
create some guidelines for

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,680
on compliance because anything you're

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,470
doing now really is a retroactive fix

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,570
what we want to do is look at how can be

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,800
better to find things so that you don't

00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,580
have to go back and delete that data

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,170
never captured in the first place and

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,870
adds the documentation and help for site

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,180
owners on how to use these tools again

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:44,710
we don't want people to be developers or

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:47,550
lawyers so so when you look in your

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,500
WordPress dashboard because you will see

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:54,940
privacy notice tool a data export tool

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,310
and not erase your tool so here is the

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,040
tool to export personal data so if

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,580
somebody files a request to see what

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,070
data you hold about them this tool will

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,830
collect all that data in an exportable

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,900
file and this is a good example of how

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,860
we have to sort of wrap our heads around

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,930
how to do this you can always export a

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,150
blog which is opposed to pages but when

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,970
you're coming to the personal data we've

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,850
had to build in the hooks so that this

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,920
tool could get the data and we had to

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,930
build in that functionality in decor and

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,240
hopefully plugins so that that data

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,770
could be sent so it was about building

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,069
back-end first

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,530
and from dent and again this is about

00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,150
best practice giving developers the

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,280
tools so that this becomes the

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,280
development standard from now on so this

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,960
is what you'll see you'll see

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,479
pending confirmed failed and completed

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,009
and we put in that it has to be a

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,810
request through the administrative

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,340
through dashboard to protect against

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,880
abuse from people saying I am this

00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,750
person it's like it it works like the

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Coleman as a stand for erasure so if

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,180
somebody requests there's there got to

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,919
be deleted this tool basically do the

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,020
same thing I'm removing the database

00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,590
please please remember that the right to

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,090
be forgotten is not absolute some of the

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,319
requests to have their account deleted

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,690
and for example you have a little

00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,400
commercial you may be required to keep

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,169
their sales records for seven years for

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,139
tax purposes you don't have to delete

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:28,720
their sales and purchasing records don't

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,639
you anything thinking you are complying

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,289
with this law which will actually cause

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,880
you to be in violation of another law

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:36,669
whether that's taxation otherwise

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,740
another question I got is abuse if you

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:42,310
suspect someone has been misusing

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,440
systems of using users and they file a

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,710
right to be forgotten request to try to

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,430
delete the evidence trail to do so this

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,590
was my baby

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,070
monthly Caroline one the privacy notice

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:56,830
tool one of the requirements of GTR is

00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:59,110
the right to be informed so you have to

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:03,880
inform your users and everything you are

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:06,789
doing with their data so this is to kill

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,310
those awful legally worded nonsense

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:13,960
gibberish privacy policies that are the

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:16,360
size of a novel it's what but that's a

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,450
gift and a challenge because people have

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,460
to write these on their own

00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,170
they can copy-paste someone else that

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,200
cut down one template they can't get a

00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:26,600
lawyer to charge you 2,000 pounds honest

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,760
to god mm transcript page of legal

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,650
gibberish that bears no resemblance to

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,480
what's happening on the site so we can't

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,760
write these privacy notices for people

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,250
but what we do is provide them with

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,720
number one the tool to do it number two

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,650
the prompts so they know what to do

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,630
so we've provided a starter tool for a

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,670
GD P already crime scene notice and as I

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,230
said it's not the template there's

00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,570
headers and there's prompts and there's

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,180
a tutorial into in the dashboard but

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,490
it's just that we're building in the

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,750
functionality to feed in info from

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:03,380
plugins and themes for example so your

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,820
comment form entries oh my god newest

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:13,910
windows feature update is ready to

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:15,260
install because example your comment

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,840
form entries are stored on the database

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,370
but a site administrator might not know

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,780
that and that could get them in trouble

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:25,880
as we certainly saw so we again we don't

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,980
want people to have to be developers and

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,780
go into the governs of their sites and

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,570
find out what's on the database what's

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,540
this so we want to build it inside the

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,400
plugin is capturing personal data that

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,220
will show up in the privacy notice tools

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:44,240
saying comments are stored here you were

00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:46,250
whatever switcher and again the admin is

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,480
responsible for publishing this we only

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:53,090
provide the page and the tool and the

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,430
prompts the admin still has to write it

00:08:53,090 --> 00:09:00,730
and hit publish so you will see this

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:06,580
privacy policy page

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:09,190
our time with this X so we explain what

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,880
this is for what you do with it

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,710
so check out our guide is the link to

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,780
the tutorial that I wrote about Siri

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:21,040
Karen fight so that guy didn't tell you

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,140
what you need right wanting you to write

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,960
it we have it so you select an existing

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:31,540
page or create a new one okay here's my

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,770
guide or the start of it so this text

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,600
template will help you to create the

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,430
websites privacy policy and I've had

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,960
some really good feedback on this that

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,500
people are not finding it very very

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,610
helpful that they appreciate that we're

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,940
not going to do it for them but we're

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:51,190
going to tell them what to do

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:53,620
so yeah yeah so we have a food UX debate

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:58,180
about I mean we know full well that

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,560
people are going to hit publish we do

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,930
put in a tweak or two so that you get

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,270
the hint something really really proud

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,100
of that because we've made it possible

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,590
for everyone with the WordPress website

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,210
to provide their users with the clarity

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,780
and the transparency that they need to

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:19,030
trust the site and be probably cooled by

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:21,040
lawyers this is actually - so the next

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:24,330
area of work we focused on was

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,160
guidelines for plugins on privacy so

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,140
some great numbers of the team wrote

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,480
some good documentation for developers

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,400
so that when they're developing a plugin

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,380
that they know how to feed in these

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,970
focus of function

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,880
for the privacy notice for the data

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,920
export tool we're looking at the plug-in

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,350
guidelines and what they say and don't

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,570
say again any work being done now it is

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,220
just applying fixes to whatever's get

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,590
done so this is something we're going to

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,480
turn our attention to now keeping in

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,460
mind that it is a very contentious issue

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,990
some people don't think we should be

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,180
telling developers how to develop plug

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,830
it isn't some of us if you look at them

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,520
right now they're very thin on the

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,140
ground about what they say about various

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,260
privacy issues so we're going to take a

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,900
look at that this I am really proud of I

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,410
work with make up still again with you t

00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,360
to get compliance removed from

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,760
guidelines so that you can no longer say

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,450
that a plug-in makes your site compliant

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,130
in anything any plugin that some of you

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,360
this will make you keep your compliant

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,560
this will make you cook you on complain

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,140
you can't say that anymore

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,320
you can say that the plugin assists with

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,420
aspects of the journey as it should you

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,290
can say it provides tools and workflows

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:40,260
help parts of it but you cannot say this

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,740
will make you compliant so niihka did a

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,620
scrub first I think she's got about

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,260
1,200 plugins the word compliance in

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,450
them and after she removed all the false

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,630
positive she got it down to about 250

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,790
one of them has half a million installs

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,030
so she's had to be in touch with 250

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,960
plug-in developers about changing their

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,100
descriptions they're so open to keep

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,150
their plugins in the repo but they're

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,070
not allowed to say this with media

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,770
compliant it's not just GT together

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,770
cookies and privacy there I have seen a

00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,930
plug-in that it was

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,060
a bunch of wizards that promise to spit

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,310
out a watertight business contract for

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,450
you based on whatever information you

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:23,339
put in the idea that a wordpress plugin

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,220
for free that you found in the repo

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:30,270
quick guarantee worse business's legal

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,250
compliance hey who's the idiot who wrote

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,740
that who the idiots who installed that's

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,570
not what Florida was enough to do so the

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,310
else online compliance team found a

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,200
plugin that was offering to make a site

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,149
88 compliant which is the Americans with

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,399
Disabilities Act and the plugin was not

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:49,200
EDA compliant so I'd resent any work on

00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,910
stages about this for eight years and

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,510
I'm so glad we sort of clear the problem

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,220
with the route so the next area we took

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,930
a look at is documentation and health

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,630
which I would be writing right now if I

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,610
wasn't here with you we provided some

00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,220
informations for users information for

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,670
site administrators and information for

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,709
developers both on things like how to

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,540
use the focus in plugins and then more

00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,000
broad things like how to conduct a

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,920
privacy impact assessment and automatic

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,529
legal department has started a site

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,990
called privacy blog which is sort of

00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:24,089
modeled on their transparency report as

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,640
well just being a little more clear

00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:30,029
about how the project and how the

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,010
product uses data so what is next for

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:36,660
the project it's important to remember

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:38,790
GPR does not need privacy so the core

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,709
group that did achieve our compliance

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,589
project is we are continuing as a

00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,329
permanent privacy subgroup so I think we

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:50,670
need to edit this now because there's a

00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:53,970
new one privacy as a principle not as a

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:56,760
means of meeting the view requires of

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,310
one specific law swampy privacy as a

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,620
concept but this is something I've been

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,269
difficult about anybody

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,899
it's worth it we have to depress define

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:09,730
what privacy means privacy can mean many

00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,579
things to many different people there

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:16,149
are legal aspects there are cultural

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:18,009
aspects so before we just start throwing

00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,410
traffic that's around I want us to work

00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:23,880
on defining what falls under the rubric

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,089
of privacy is a consent is it

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,069
transparency

00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:29,529
I didn't possibly expand this to know

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:31,420
the sort of standard I've been given the

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,670
contact addresses of some people the

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,319
Drupal community I'm going to be meeting

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,360
with next week in the Netherlands to see

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,759
if maybe we can get this common language

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,160
failing and you're welcome to join us

00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,800
our office hours are 1500 UTC on

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,589
Wednesdays in making WP slack right now

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,690
the slack root is called GPR compliance

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:51,699
we're going to change it to privacy and

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,730
have a fortnight just getting a little

00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:57,009
rest in case people are confused so we

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,829
have as of this morning 91 emergency

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:01,750
track tickets open most of which are bug

00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:07,410
fixes some of which are investments and

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,410
he has completed sleep 5.0 registered

00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:15,670
functionality available in network wise

00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:18,550
for super admins so we have a couple

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,620
tickets we're going to look at those are

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:24,269
bug fixes estimates add missing unit

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,439
folks there's issues like for telemetry

00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:29,319
are going to continue cooking a stick

00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:31,029
into that B type so next up for me as

00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,970

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,230
protection privacy

00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:39,970

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,339
and responsible data process work

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,860
