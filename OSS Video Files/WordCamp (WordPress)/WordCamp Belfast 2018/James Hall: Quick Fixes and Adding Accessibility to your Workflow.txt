turning up for this chat we are going to

00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,259
talk about kind of accessibility on

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,480
general why it's important and how we're

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,460
going to start working this in to

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,149
essentially your your workflow so

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,329
nothing ever impacts on anything yes and

00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,800
forth really like just have a quick hand

00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,259
it's the only time you will be audience

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:37,470
participation and so counsel if you're a

00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:44,310
developer designer content writer agency

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:47,700
owner accessibility fan perfect you guys

00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,770
with my favorite be a bit of a

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,150
background about myself yeah I've worked

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,020
in local government for a very long time

00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,930
I was able to kind of use all of my

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,930
knowledge in an actual free not into

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,030
into hex productions in all of the

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,430
accessibility is flipping right in all

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,229
honestly it's not only going to help you

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,390
from making sure that you are including

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,030
everyone into your website into your

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,250
mobile applications but independently

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,770
you're bringing us into a bit of an SEO

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,680
strategy as well if a screen reader can

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,180
read your content so can Google so if

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,890
you are having a little bit of trouble

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,930
really emphasize that point I've got a

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,610
background procuring server and kind of

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,180
content management systems so working

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,680
have a good understanding who it is the

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,000
content management system the helps but

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,530
it's also a lot of things you need to

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,470
put into work there to allow your

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,119
content to be accessible and currently

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,950
working with the GES at the moment to

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,150
actually help implement any legislation

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,510
to move on an app I have an

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,400
accessibility and on that point you've

00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:55,170
got till the 29th please please please

00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,369
submit any in any consultation comments

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,380
that you may have about how to make

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,380
public bodies website accessible

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,480
to give you a good idea of an

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,240
inaccessible website there you go some

00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,070
people will not see anything on their

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,960
webpage they will not hear anything on a

00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,510
webpage so when you're developing

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,910
something or cuddle designing or even

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,470
thinking about the webpage sometimes

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,020
this is the responses they're going to

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,600
get absolutely nothing so we're willing

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,100
to make sure that any website you create

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,420
is for everyone so there's quite a few

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,950
things that you can kind of think that

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,080
obviously we've just looked at site on

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,690
there you could also think that things

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,620
like hearing impairments what happens if

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,310
someone is reading your video but you

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,320
can't actually see any of the subtitles

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,270
they may also just be on a bus and they

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,090
don't want to actually have their audio

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:58,980
being displayed so again subtitles is a

00:02:51,090 --> 00:03:01,260
brilliant way of stopping that so yeah

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,030
leave all my subtitles is extremely

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,650
useful so it's little things like this

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,940
you can start working into your content

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,080
one thing I would highly recommend doing

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,330
and I didn't have time to put in this

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,090
presentation if you google with fros an

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,590
audio description if you've got children

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,030
maybe don't do it with them because I

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,250
want to watch that film again and again

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,019
and again but have a look at the trailer

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,820
with that audio describes it is

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,080
fantastic and certainly something that

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,459
will really help you push things forward

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,620
when you thinking about people with a

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,840
disability you're thinking about one in

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,030
five people in the UK now if your

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,890
websites inaccessible one in five people

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,890
cannot access the information on your

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:45,360
website we all don't think that is right

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,150
if you think about this in a real world

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,060
example it's a beautiful family kind of

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,590
randomly picked at random in there but

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,730
there's five people in this in this

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,239
sermon screen now not one of them has

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,130
declared themselves as being disabled

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,530
but you've got four people in that

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,330
screen that require glasses you have

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,850
three people that do have a mild case of

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,950
dyslexia you've got two people that have

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,970
very short attention

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:17,419
sponge and one person is elderly now all

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,160
of those aspects and all of those and an

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,650
idea the people or those those

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,930
characteristics of people actually

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,700
require you to think about how your

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,580
content is on a website or a mobile

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,040
device you think about my sister she

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,260
uses the phone all of the time and I

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,960
said where you are time of day she'll be

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,360
on her phone now today's a lovely

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,919
beautiful day what happens is her screen

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,410
is been impaired because there is a

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,500
bright light of Sun on her screen he

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,330
can't read her content so again thinking

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,220
of other ways to have that content read

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,800
out to that one allow in touch you stop

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,370
so in consuming that information without

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:59,600
the need of relying on just text on the

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:03,680
screen if we think about the population

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:07,130
of northern islands 1.81 million roughly

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,870
give or take and if we use the one in

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,000
five statistic that's three hundred

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,150
three hundred sixty-two thousand people

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,520
registered as disabled so potentially

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,560
this amount of people cannot new a

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,810
webpage because you've not gone through

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,970
the process that white is inaccessible

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,100
so we plan with design we develop we put

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,470
on life and soul into building things

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,289
what we're not thinking about everyone

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,440
while we do that now there could be many

00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:38,510
reasons why we aren't doing that

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,180
knowledge is a key one now we're still

00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,370
learning as an agency we've partnered up

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,600
with the shore trust to actually bring

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,130
more knowledge into this I do not have a

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,070
visual impairment I have glasses to help

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,960
me see when I'm looking distances we've

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,180
got someone like Alan who is completely

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,190
blind requires a screen reader to

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,710
actually go through that whole websites

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,110
I can't replicate that I can close my

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,430
eyes and try using the jaws system but

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,650
actually having that knowledge and

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,380
having that expertise will help us move

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,729
that forward and as an agency any

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,979
website that we produce will be

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,660
accessible from a double-a and triple-a

00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,650
standard and when using the knowledge

00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,639
from shore trust

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,440
or anything we produce follows that the

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,810
one thing we'll talk about today is time

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,820
time is not an excuse

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,759
time is something that we can always

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,860
make for time is something that is just

00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:35,539
that we've not workflow that properly so

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,759
think about every step the client who's

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,050
got a fan of a client that always wants

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,090
to blow their just something a little

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,600
bit more bigger or they they really want

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,400
a website to pop out of the screen and

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,160
in all honesty if you should be building

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,850
designing or creating websites

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,800
accessibility should always be in your

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,970
mind you should always be developing or

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,449
designing a website that is accessible

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,400
it should happen for them automatically

00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,660
there are laws for back jinsei why it's

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,030
going to cost me more money if it's

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,740
going to be accessible you may think

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,870
there's a designer a developer or an

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,610
agency owner that it's going to cost you

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,830
more money to do that but again it's

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,599
thinking about how your work frozen in

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,060
place to make sure that everything that

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,060
you do is just flowing the normal flow

00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:21,139
is really adamant that right got no

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,470
money you can't make this website

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:27,940
successful think about a very orange

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,349
airline that have very decent fares

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,960
they've got on their website that you

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,150
know nearly half a million people

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,750
registered disables use their flight

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:41,240
services if you think about that from an

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,010
average fare you can pay that's from

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,159
over here and but an average there's

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,470
roughly about 90 pounds so if they

00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,409
couldn't services people on a website on

00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,630
our application that's a hell of a lot

00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:55,130
of money that they're losing and it's

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,190
little things like that that we can

00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,159
easily put into our briefs on our

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,419
conversations with clients to actually

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:06,800
show them what they are missing out on

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:09,289
but that's the party you know think

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,970
about your everyday life how many times

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,800
did you miss the beam collection and

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,360
needed to kind of contact the council to

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,710
say can I come and pick it back up again

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,760
a lot of website forms are inaccessible

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,470
labels are in

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,050
correctly maybe the color contrast is

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,360
incorrect if you think that everything

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,280
that you do on a day-to-day level you've

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,200
done a thing like there's a lot of

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,229
people here that can't actually use the

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,580
content they can't consume anything so

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,200
really have to think about that and then

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,530
take those little world examples to

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,010
client and the way that we looked at

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,690
this is we saw that there was a need you

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,050
know we need to stop making websites

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,370
that are fully accessible for everyone

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,050
so we didn't even the short dress

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,880
fielders went down to these to actually

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,980
witness one of our counsels actually

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,500
being completely honest we were able to

00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,690
sit back actually witness this and so we

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,550
have a lot of different disabilities

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,200
being shown to us and actually how the

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,230
website should actually start being put

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,030
together the team was fantastic they've

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,400
really welcomed this thing really opened

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,970
our eyes up to kind of different ways of

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,230
doing things and these are real people

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:20,240
you know we use personas all the time in

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,860
the work that we do but hands up you

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,840
actually use a persona of actually has a

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,130
disability or has something that that

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,770
has a way of not using a webpage

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,420
efficiently we don't think about this so

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,310
we use real people actually find out

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,960
what they're doing and how they're using

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:40,160
their websites to make sure that it is

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,860
working right for exactly we do how can

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,510
we help our clients how can we help

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,010
people that are visiting the web pages

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:51,140
to do that everything starts here that

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,420
very first meeting that very first

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,190
client interaction that you have it's an

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,080
email a phone call a face-to-face

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,090
meeting

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,590
everything gets brought up here you tell

00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,180
them why you're making your website

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,350
successful you're telling them what

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,870
we're doing to make sure that we're

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,380
doing that this may not eat with the

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,270
coins

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,880
this can be your team your third-party

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,310
providers your freelancers that you

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,720
might be using anyone is part of your

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,750
project you've brought in for

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,930
accessibility right at the start we try

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,910
to go to a content management provider

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,490
they wanted us to help him with

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,960
accessibility it's a great haven't

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,410
talked to us when it's 80% done and

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,930
we'll stop

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,399
my accessibility think about things have

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,470
gone wrong since then think of how many

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,850
times that they've had a question but

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,350
they're just not thought about it so

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,240
they've done display:none with hitting

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,329
it straight away everything should be

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,069
considered right at the start what did

00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:45,319
you move that on then start to think

00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:46,879
about the wireframes so even though

00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:48,410
you're not putting any color to the

00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,420
screen what you're doing is you're

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,129
starting to get the layout right is

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,290
there a common carousel or a slider

00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:57,649
being involved in here all the yearly

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,610
being used yes fantastic so how is that

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,009
going to be displayed on the screen

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,720
reader so when it's like moves are you

00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:05,060
still reading the content does the

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,310
person have control of the slider just

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,649
the video autoplay things like this

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,300
you'd really have to consider and things

00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,649
that we'd always look at and I have to

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,089
thank you very much for bringing us up

00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:16,970
yesterday with during the contrary to

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,579
that the the Ali project comm checklist

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,689
is fantastic when you start wire framing

00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,949
check this out

00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:23,389
because it'll give you a couple of

00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:26,959
points of weight you can actually start

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:28,250
being a troll who spirits and it's

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,740
something that is definitely worth

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,630
making a note so you go to your designer

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,689
all you developer you'll then be able to

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,759
start working with them on that and then

00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:39,680
moving on into the design phase they're

00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,000
aware of what's gone on they're aware of

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,500
what we're doing what we're trying to

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,410
achieve and how we're trying to achieve

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,699
it so start thinking with them and start

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,139
talking to the developers make sure

00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:52,850
there's a nice float with everything

00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:54,259
talking because this will help they can

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,360
really concentrate on are things like

00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:58,399
color contrast so color contrast is

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,990
massive you need to make sure that you

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,550
are differentiated so here we've got an

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,519
example of a color blind test and

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,720
there's a number in there some people in

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,389
this room will be able to see it and

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,800
some people what you'll see so what we

00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:14,449
need to do as designers and developers

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,439
have make sure that we find ways that

00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:19,880
they can differentiate so if the things

00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:23,209
you can try are the color contrast

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,699
checker so this is what was on

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,480
corporates orange and this was our

00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:28,940
quarterback

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,699
on our website and we found out we

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,220
failed every single time

00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:38,029
so by making extremely small change to

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,160
the foreground hello we've then become

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:44,420
pretty much successful on heading tags

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,769
and yes very good normal text but very

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,470
little chance that we don't be using

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:49,760
them we just looked at the lightness and

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,790
the difference between the two that

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,360
we're using that is a minor difference

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,310
that is very very small but I tell you

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,360
what is making a world of difference to

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:03,860
a lot of people I put one to go on and

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,930
the resource color contrast checker

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,019
please give it a go you can put in hex

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,730
codes if you have a map or interests

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:12,110
about anything there are kind of color

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,240
droppers that you can pick up the news

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,440
and there are apps all of these links

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,730
will be available so we'll make sure

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,240
that you all have access to all of these

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:24,620
as well we use Trello on a

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,110
second-by-second basis it feels like get

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,910
notifications on what they have labels

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,350
and the way that they've worked on the

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,579
color contrast is actually putting in

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,019
patterns to allow people to

00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:34,819
differentiate between the different

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,800
colors within there so it's not just the

00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:39,649
case of making sure that you're only

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,240
using a completely opposite colors

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:44,870
you're actually putting patterns into

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,760
that as well and because everything

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,620
you've done everyone's been part of this

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,399
you can then pass this over to the

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,930
developers

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,290
you've got your wireframes you know what

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,360
you're going to be using certain role

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,800
and then what will be now is they'll

00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,269
just be putting those final touches on

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,920
things they'll be making sure that

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,180
you've got skip links in there you'll

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,920
make sure that you've got the right

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,959
areas the right links and the right

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,060
places because it's all be my friend

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:12,440
it's all been thoughts about the designs

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,319
of them there for you one of our biggest

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:19,250
biggest bugbears

00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:20,870
these things everyone's using something

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,970
like font or sermon or maybe another

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,310
icon fonts know if you use something

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,019
like SPG's fantastic you can put a title

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,040
in there you can get the text being read

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:33,920
out to you but if you have kind of the

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,950
standard font awesome font that's great

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,889
it's being displayed on the screen

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,779
now he puts a web link in there you

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:44,050
think right on the stream leader that

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,700
needs to be read out but the problem is

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,680
they're not going to read anything

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,130
there's no text in there whatsoever

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,920
stating that this is a link to something

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:55,779
so by plotting just a hidden area in

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,850
here there's not being displayed from

00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,279
the front and it's being just displayed

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,920
in the cover it's allowing you to say

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,480
what the link is doing so someone like

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,820
Alan who uses a screen reader will

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,959
actually hear it visit Facebook and they

00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:13,209
know that they'll be going to the

00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:17,290
Facebook web page see taking a photo I

00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:18,639
won't change it and for the front end

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,500
everything looks the same

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,880
nothing's changed so your style if

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,260
you're gonna keep your designers happy

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,329
you're going to keep the be assured

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:29,199
color because it's still going to be

00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:31,930
looking exactly the same not one word on

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,540
quite a bit now I'd like you guys to

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,889
actually see or hear this in action so

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,899
we're going to welcome Alan up to the

00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,279
screen TV quick introduction and then

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:41,890
what we're going to do is go through how

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,470
the screen reader users and it hurt me

00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,000
to do a very bad accessible web page and

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,510
how the difference it looks from an

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,620
accessible now we're going to do this on

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:58,870
the screen Alan's keys and how they live

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:03,149
anyone online we're gonna try and set up

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:16,860
a bit of a live streaming as well so I'm

00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:19,720
typing so afternoon it's on the screen

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:25,079
on the screen you've got a site that

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:30,670
james's and put together all that cheese

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:35,019
this is a bad site for accessibility in

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:39,100
the moment we'll show you how the better

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:41,470
one or the good one looks okay so please

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,930
take note hope this have any changed

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,329
recently

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:48,910
now generally said you can watch my

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:53,200
hands and how drawers works

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:56,770
but think about that virtual reality if

00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:00,940
you want to close your eyes okay be my

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:03,520
virtual reality and hear what I see

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:08,140
because sometimes the site and them

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:13,030
you're hearing sort of oak takes I'll

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:15,730
leave up to you and right so with the

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:19,780
jaws they use a lot of shortcut keys to

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:22,300
navigate around a page now we've got

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:25,900
memories for screen reader they only

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,840
hear where the cursor lands nothing

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,840
around the outside or to left or to the

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:37,440
right or any direction so just literally

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,440
willikers and lands is why here okay

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:46,300
okay so just go refresh the page

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:51,820
attending that I've just gone through it

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:55,330
via a Google link or something okay

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,310
so when James sent me this initially it

00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,220
did record sit back in my chair so

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:23,070
hopefully that's it okay so it's with an

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:23,070
initial ready yes or any barrier

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:48,289
okay so it's taking a few minutes or

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,360
seconds to find out where causes and to

00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:54,950
actually pause the video so I can

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:58,639
operate my screen user screen reader

00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:00,139
sorry to navigate around the page now

00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:03,289
the first thing I normally do when I get

00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:07,250
to a page is look for headings and the

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:09,649
headings will for screen reader minimize

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,570
how much information is on a screen

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:14,240
if you think of a newspaper you've got a

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:18,610
head in and then you've got different

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:22,090
text size or font slides to each sub

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:25,129
story and your eyes can visually go to

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:28,100
that store you want to leave on the page

00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:31,659
and then go to that page to get more

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,279
information from it that is just like a

00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:36,679
web page hopefully with headings but if

00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:40,370
you imagine you have got no heaviness it

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,500
will be like looking at a newspaper all

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,809
the same form same color all the way

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,659
down and what I'll have to do then is

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:51,049
listen to the whole page now we've only

00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:54,649
got a small page here if you imagine a

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:56,690
bigger site we've got 20 30 pages to get

00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:59,720
the information you actually want it's

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,139
going to be quite difficult so I have

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:08,389
got a shortcut key which brings down all

00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:13,840
the headings and hopefully adding like

00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:13,840
dialogue tenants now more many oh no oh

00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:25,399
okay so more men Helen Colin I want the

00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,799
one so there because same things if

00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:30,450
there's no headings there but we have

00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:33,359
got one which is the YouTube video

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,460
I've got nothing else so am I now

00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,029
thinking is any of the content on the

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,759
page

00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:39,749
or is it just videos okay because if

00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,119
I've got that they're not going to

00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:45,899
quickly jump to the information

00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:48,029
okay monkeys buddy at pretending level

00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:50,519
tell hormones

00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:52,440
so don't YouTube video might come to my

00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,659
channel check Gavin Weber how to make

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,629
channel channel I want to have my chili

00:20:54,659 --> 00:21:01,109
cheese on that okay anything else

00:20:57,629 --> 00:21:03,690
hey doesn't matter okay but obviously on

00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:05,909
the website you can have your details in

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:11,369
contact details you're gonna have

00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:15,090
different information about cheese's on

00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:17,759
here or to go to other people's websites

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,970
of cuts sponsoring you or allowing you

00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:26,009
to advertise on there so headings is a

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:30,539
really good tool for screen reader okay

00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:33,480
now we have little bits of the form

00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:36,299

00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:49,139
again is somebody who's doing a site is

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,700

00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:54,269
contact with that person who's visiting

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,739
but the headings they've got no

00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:58,529
information there about how to keep in

00:21:55,739 --> 00:22:01,019

to allow other sites of you heard today

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:51,640
to have that information is it allowing

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,920
people to share certain information so I

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,670
may be going down there clicking it and

00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,180
not really knowing what it is as a at

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:03,730
Lockhart and captain lock off and I can

00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,370
also navigate individual enough to use

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,890
the jewels list and a minute so it's got

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,380

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:15,640
minute me let it right so the

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:18,730
email radial button no check HTML okay

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,510
so look at the round object X is

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,820
actually about HTML what for the no

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:27,270
radial button and I check blank tech

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,310
plain textile up something over my the

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:34,390
HTML or plain text knives up for the

00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:37,660
email is that for a newsletter other

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:40,750
start guessing something else that comes

00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,550
on websites that perhaps is more debate

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,480
on the people who are blind or visually

00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:48,610
impaired is the use of graphics now

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,350
graphics are good for myself a lot more

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:57,150
so I was 28 and but I've got some memory

00:23:53,350 --> 00:24:02,290
of images you know things happen in life

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:04,300
so they bring a website to life but what

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:07,440
we've got here hopefully technocratic

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,570
dialog one less now tell my belt

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,820

there have really again is it's not been

00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:25,360
taking time very poor thing is there

00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:26,440
James on the bull of space between hello

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,930
and Belfast

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:33,010
now that's meteor one to work out some

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:36,570
arm I have to go over key by key can't

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:40,600

wait did a little bit better than I do

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,590
suggest some website to go to and

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,600
there's own

00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,669
graphics on their budget just numbered

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,460
this is got some numbers there

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,929
now the problem there is I don't know

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,169
whether I'm missing something

00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:59,220
is it an instruction is something that's

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:03,120
it going to be important information

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:05,669
behind is that we wondering why it's

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,519
going to happen that one less now can't

00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:12,870
bash pop okay but I do know it's a

00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:16,080
cheese photo I've gotta do it makes now

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:18,509
punch campaign you're like okay we're

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,850
choosing Radley cauliflower can solve

00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:26,509
Express carefully our camp chance for

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:28,950
our our camp arrange everything along

00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:33,749
okay what's really there it should be a

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:37,950
list okay a great sort of example that I

00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:43,889
thought somebody is if you list when you

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:46,649
go shopping chocolate buttons okay so do

00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:49,980
you get chocolate buttons from Cadbury's

00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:54,149
or do you get two items chocolate and

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:56,519
some buttons for revenue possible okay

00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:59,129
so the screen reader is just listening

00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,899
or reading our whole sentence which

00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:05,490
would be I see a list how much brain

00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:10,009

everything's okay silence capacity

00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:33,920
ourselves later

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:37,100

obviously play and pause are the same

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:55,730
initial letter it's going to take me a

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:57,200
long time to get there yeah yeah okay

00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,050

her call and dream and then there's the

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,590
newsletter

00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:11,350
okay so again I can just ignore it away

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,810
the rest of the page and you jump to

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:18,850
that and think don't do get the

00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:22,540
newsletter okay Oh chanting example of

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:26,890
got a 11 wire the nice dialogue might

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:28,750
join now epic okay I've got pink slavery

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:33,280
we didn't go down the bad example but I

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:35,620
can just show you on the good one I had

00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,730
to contend that normally means there's a

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:41,240
on every page you go on your

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:44,420
Paves there's going to be the duplicated

00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,700
sort of home contactless links at the

00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,460
top depending on how many you've got

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,430
there as to how the distance from the

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:56,780
top to your main contact now to go skip

00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:59,350
link it with or should skip the user all

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:02,030
the way down to the main information

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,100
alternatively a screen reader can use

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:07,250
the number one to jump to the heading

00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,500
level one or have you seen or heard

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:13,540
going up to the headings list and

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:16,070
finding that hello Belfast Ballentine

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:19,130
okay next one down with a link

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:22,090
accessibility statement two things here

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,580
the accessibility statement should give

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:29,120
confidence to people who use assistive

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:31,490
technology to know that your site is

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,950
helping them so they've got that

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:36,590
confidence going all through your the

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:41,210
procedures and actually get into the end

00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:43,010
product along with helpful hints that

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:45,410
perhaps they not known before that we

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,900
fed the started using assistive

00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:51,590
technology things like for PDFs and

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:54,410
other documents lots of times when we

00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:56,690
test aside the accessibility link isn't

00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:01,220
all me or sometimes at the bottom of the

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,270
page now myself I think well if there's

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,990
something there that's going to help

00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:08,630
somebody don't you want to the first one

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,610
or two links you're at you know for

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,020
myself I don't look I have the

00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,270
information if I'm gonna go all the way

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,400
down to the bottom I've been there done

00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:19,100
it already okay

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,260
don't work and we can paint the Apple up

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:26,150
record talker and can't me right record

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:28,970
what okay so there's a PDF file there on

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:31,630
the bad one it wasn't labeled PDF it is

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:34,760
a link this one is telling the user

00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:38,780
whether your screen reader or you see

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,340
visually yeah yeah visually these PDF

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,090
you know what document you're opening

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,310
and the size if giving the all the

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,110
information there to anybody who wants

00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:50,539
to take note of that

00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,399
or if they want to open it and realize

00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,950
that's up to them signing up Ferrari

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,399
report and let parents not only write

00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:00,740
parent okay so we've got their swing of

00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:04,509
expert signing up for our expert course

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:07,100
okay now our James isn't they and put

00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:09,710
information alongside again can you see

00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,169
recently no no okay so it's not visual

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,600
but for a screen reader is allowing them

00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:17,149
to know that when activating that link

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,240
is going to go to a new window now you

00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:23,149
might think why is that important

00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:26,990
the importance is that somebody might go

00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:29,179
then on that new window go to the home

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,019
link and think they're coming back on

00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:34,870
your home page if they're not realizing

00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:38,539
they're actually on a different site

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:40,639
they're there you may lose your client

00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:43,340
your visitor okay but they're you've

00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:47,090
given them the information to know how

00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:49,429
to navigate back to your site or to

00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,139
delete the one they're on which

00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:56,059
automatically will go back to yours

00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:59,899
oh it's my car okay now hopefully that

00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:02,659
the links lady in there giving the

00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:04,639
direction to the screen reader what

00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:07,149
information is gonna happen or you're

00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,440
gonna get when you outside that link so

00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:11,960
this is a look at these graphs elixir

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,169
the rally's dialogue a wedge more

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,559
Campell bad great well hello was welcome

00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:23,120
own bill faster okay question or

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,990
anything okay that one is a sattva same

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:30,379
graphics but it's a bit more descriptive

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:32,990
is telling me what sort cheese it is and

00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:35,360
okay now we had another discussion last

00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,429
night said that perhaps somebody who's

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,190
been blind since birth not necessarily

00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:42,529
gonna remember what image that is in

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:46,639
their head but there must be some of the

00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:50,330
in my opinion sense of how Swiss cheese

00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:52,580
tasted or smelt and I think I'm sure it

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,880
would be very that sort of sense if they

00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,540
knew there as well

00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:03,100
so again a good description on actually

00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:05,320
what's happening it beneficial and so

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:15,970
let's go and see if we can find how to

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:18,880
sign up for the diocese a web camera

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:24,010
20 a slice of our cut 20 a slice of a

00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:27,900
hectare heading level or the tales name

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:31,530
why you tenets which is required a male

00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:34,360
females acquired okay why your intended

00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:37,450
alright why your antenna required front

00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,550
while you're at it needs are but require

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:51,820
that a demo call her one right why

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:55,210
you're dead okay so that gives you a

00:34:51,820 --> 00:35:00,580
brief sort of outline on this is one

00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:02,740
page on first the experience of an

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,840
inaccessible website there's going to

00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,540
hinder somebody who wants to visit your

00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,260
site and keep on there being trusted the

00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,590
second part

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:14,050
it shows how by a few adjustments and

00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:17,070
labeling and me them just what wooden

00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:21,520
space in the labeling will assist

00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:25,900
somebody can't see and allow them to

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,770
stay in your site and you know improve

00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:31,770
their experience and hopefully come back

00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,770
okay

00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:46,140
hopefully so much it is just um it

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:49,710
really it's kind of joke that when you

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,540
actually see this actually in place so

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,309
just a few things to sum up in

00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,920
practicing putting this energy workflow

00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:58,589
until you see this actually happening we

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,599
find it very hard to actually start to

00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:02,640
move things forward so things that is

00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,150
worth going back to actually start

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,040
inputting information please have a look

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,829
at me the Aria website to allow you to

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,770
add extra information to cope you

00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:16,530
develop so for example if you add sink

00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,540
into a basket then it's great if you

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,640
find out something added to a basket but

00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:24,210
from extremely visible to you how do

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,839
they know so things like Aria life is

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:30,690
extremely and exciting from the Pope on

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,030
TV you can actually program real

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:36,089
shopping cultures readouts but maybe one

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:40,280
items benefits maybe the seats number

00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:40,280
pops everything will be read out to them

00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:48,150
and so allowing this free movie to be

00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:50,309
get out so extremely useful there are so

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:54,599
many of these labels have a look at

00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:56,490
please take your time have a proven way

00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,319
it's brilliant it's a very good

00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,329
automated tool so when you go through

00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:02,460
some of your checks think maybe some of

00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:04,740
your designers Willie developers using

00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,660
something like wave on a Chrome or

00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,240
Firefox plug-in all actually on this

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,400
webpage will quickly highlight some of

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,220
the issues heading structure for pay

00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,400
trust issues

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:19,680
forms not being correctly many things

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:24,329
very very good very quick very easy to

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,160
use sites improve also do a Chrome

00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:28,920
extension it does exactly the same thing

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,510
but this will actually link you to the

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,849
Rick had guidelines that you're actually

00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,920
failing at the moment so rather than

00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:36,900
just seeing that the error is it will

00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,090
help you educate you start finding out

00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,640
why

00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:45,410
that's it again I know these links

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,410
