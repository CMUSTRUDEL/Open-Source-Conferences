	Progressive Web Apps (PWA) is a concept related to user experience especially for mobile users, where the focus is to deliver websites that are Reliable, Fast and Engaging.
PWA became so popular the past year but how can we apply it to our WordPress projects?

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,520
some just the beginning will be like

00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,320

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,500
presentation just for introduction but

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,679
that was gonna show more like old stuff

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,679
[Music]

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,650
I satellite with WordPress 2008 it was

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,570
something there

00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:57,870
I had my blog and Monday I got a job to

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,640
do a blog and I didn't know how how much

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,510
worker we're gonna have with that

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,489
because was a famous work with you and

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:09,420
was that huge oh it's an after they just

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,460
stuck with WordPress and for while I

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,540
just jumped for all the technology but I

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,370
still engage it with WordPress because I

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,080
was also the wood came some organizing

00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,119
like during three three years in Sao

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,240
Paulo I was responsible to organize

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,310
there and after that I such like

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,150
speaking in order what games and when I

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:37,530
came to work and I went you some wood

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,159
games across yo I think my first what

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,670
keep in your book was working on them

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:48,530
was 2016 was the first one the first

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:53,700
event was a speaker was healed professed

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:56,990
was a kind of like that in the last 12

00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,800
hours I discovered I go to speak here

00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:05,930
that works cuz I'm here

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:09,710
so and for today today we will see like

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:13,410
about the emotion behind it of the way

00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:15,600
the basic stuff that we need to do with

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,070
WordPress for mid-foot make the fiends

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,200
walls and serviceworker and in the name

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,440
we were gonna show like some features

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,780
with javascript but the making that

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,060
argument that are gonna show here is the

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,120
integration with what present that way

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,450
there's some 315 study needs to know how

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,760
to make this since walks and if you

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,220
don't know like to be honest like spin a

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,110
long timeline culture things because

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,540
there's some concerns about security and

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,570
how do we organize it files inside wall

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,950
there WordPress theme so how can we fix

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,560
that and so in our computer and

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:11,340
progressive web apps it's something

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:14,180
that's like I think it is up these are

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,269
the if you is something that we store

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,280
but they make things they use experience

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,769
there is no feeling religion about the

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,100
mesh code that you're gonna make your

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,440
website progress whether the things

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,580
behind it to user experience like you're

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,780
gonna give to the users user experience

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,010
as an 85 so it's a and also is something

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,780
progressive so we didn't permit

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,269
something you're gonna might add

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,549
features it's not like something at all

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,110
we will omit that bunch of features in

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,610
the lead for the class them it's

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,340
something progressively we're gonna like

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:54,360
stop feeling ease to the users some

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,870
features that they only have before in a

00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,810
native app and now it's possible with

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,120
the new advisor the the way html5 are

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:09,810
native to us and JavaScript I give to us

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,000
and there are some three three one three

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,599
members now they change it like the less

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,910
move are only differ according like fire

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,510
and they are like let's make more

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:24,289
faceless things but our needs to be fast

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,240
reliable and engaging

00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:28,770
reliable it's a simple description like

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,770
me you never saw the donors out there

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,590
the Linotype then I saw that appears in

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,860
the chrome this is the name darkness are

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:41,580
but that feels like we always eat like

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,900
the limits subject our users so we need

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:49,979
something behind you make this happen

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:53,070
and why I think now everybody know

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:57,510
everybody knows why we need to make like

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,950
some friendly or we have better

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,789
performance with the user because

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,070
everybody now is mobilizes that's change

00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:07,229
we have like the biggest numbers use

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,110
mobile phone and that's how the fuser is

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,300
really hard to engage them because they

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,360
are so strengthened and so if we create

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,160
something that take like 10 seconds nine

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,289
seconds they're just gone it's different

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,510
than the user are now desktop they're

00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:23,700
like this it that they have the patient

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:27,590
or the things happen the more values is

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:33,090
no they are like commuting or walking or

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:35,419
like the pearl whatever that's but they

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:41,280
are not full like deep in that

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:44,659
experience so hey I create this this

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,659
this talent for me

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:54,830
so today was someone inside the

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:58,490
community what would fry Simon was a guy

00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:03,830
it's an English teacher PS for help and

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:06,590
I was kind of pollinate and I just met

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,380
this guy in this guy he women like

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,260
create our website and they have like

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,920
this are hard times and I say okay I

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,080
gotta help you

00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,690
I had this presentation make my

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,660
presentation make your website and so

00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,750
that's being a group we're gonna finish

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,660
after but we already have something that

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:30,020
I'm gonna show and so it's a real

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,570
project and the first step like that we

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,530
created on our website and we need to

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:40,090
pass need to know like where are you

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,290
gonna start so Google Chrome has these

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,800
before was an extension now it's

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:49,670
something native is a lighthouse like

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,730
house it's a test inside chrome that new

00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:56,860
pass checklist and gave high score for

00:06:52,730 --> 00:07:00,110
you like say oh you have that score for

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,930
this will make user this kinda so you

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,670
had that support for performance

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:09,740
progressive web apps accessibility best

00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:11,990
prices in CEO and the Gator was a seer

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:17,210
of data that we can improve in our

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:20,060
website so the first the first test that

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,820
I did I just like make the demikhov and

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,590
put the whole thing inside WordPress and

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:31,370
we got that score was 27 miles for in

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:34,280
that application and the first the first

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:38,270
like complete that we saw was in six

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:43,910
seconds month who is not so good so we

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:48,650
gotta start from here our journey the

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:50,360
first thing just like focus on our life

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,410
the things that we we need to do man

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,360
what the white house shows to us and

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,050
they shall like eight things and I fail

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,780
so

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,759
first thing well my website doesn't have

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,099
allocated to PS is something very

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,440
important for me grades is a requirement

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:12,300
for a greater price where Beth and I

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,759
will show why we are not respond when

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,849
other applications of mine so there is

00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:22,889
some tricks that we came on the river to

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:24,840
the users something offline and there's

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:28,169
another thing that's made our app it's

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,620
all boys it's a really soon spotted like

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:34,380
manifest it so if we catch it some we

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,390
make our application this table also

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,250
what we gonna show up but if any user

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:43,800
can add this means in their home screen

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:50,220
in after Allah says for that application

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:54,779
so that's exactly sorry the checklist

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,790
that we have will be able pw8 so that

00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,610
information there is a website that

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,980
shows like why you should do that like

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,640
explain why you should do that so that

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:10,350
home information inside that checklist

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:13,140
and inside the developer google web s

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,149
web app check please so lobby that are

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,959
we gonna see everything that you need to

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:21,720
make your application I promise my bad

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,430
and now let's go that we saw that there

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:29,910
were concepts behind and now I will show

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:35,750
some code the first thing make our

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,750
f-stop book so the last year is solved

00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:45,000
so we have this icon we can be written

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:48,930
that I got a home screen so these are

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,820
it's a normal website we saw we can well

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,410
website we can do the same thing with

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:59,670
our webpage but it is about that in the

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:01,630
new version like chrome 67 that says

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:05,370
email will be available

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:08,620
that spot so we can also install our

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:12,130
progress web apps in our text or so this

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,790
were available the next version of

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,850
Chrome

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,720
there are more feature that Google I'm

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,150
coming to know that it's not just for

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,490
Chrome like chrome re-released about

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,610
Google Google's they may move like

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:32,020
interesting on that but Microsoft also

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:34,030
is interests on that now the edge has

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,970
work to appeal of the way so they

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:40,390
desktop version and they are they are

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:44,470
making plans to build a progressive web

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:49,360
apps inside their stores so something

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:58,180
that's it's alright life happened the

00:10:49,360 --> 00:11:01,030
manufacture some break-ins so it's at

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,450
least so and that fits all we we're

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:06,160
gonna have the name of our location each

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,940
other is really gonna open our

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,820
application and the most remote

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,810
structures for iPhones and different

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:25,060
size for items are I come with 48 pixels

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:28,420
like - and with nine seats and 192 so

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:34,420
that are between the four sides that we

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:39,790
need the previous stop was you you yeah

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:43,780
so we will show us like how outside some

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:47,680
features inside that custom screen we

00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:51,250
have how options to add the subtitle so

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,520
in my in my net sample it's something

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:59,360
that the last year was a partnership

00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,660
Altamonte and Buddha show in the chrome

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,930
summit that they should I would press

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,950
progressive web apps and I take that

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:14,200
saying I made some change over because

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:16,490
the guy sent me was a developer they did

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,770
he told that I don't have so many

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:23,260
experience with WordPress so I will make

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:26,210
my way and some not our device we that

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,080
we should do inside WordPress what they

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,000
are for today

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,210
that guy was folks in performance and

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,940
worldly King might gathered the first

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,340
experience so they didn't care about the

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,390
departments in he didn't know so much of

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:45,110
what we have decided WordPress so and

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:50,240
moving that simple we have that thing

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:54,230
that's a cycle cycle so we can use that

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,870
feature to write a resume because that

00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:00,410
function that I created here great suck

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,540
when we hit that let errors we just get

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,510
back to the user edges home with the

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,120
features that we came but we have inside

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:11,630
the WordPress so we are creating that

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:16,960
file dynamically so that's five that's

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,960
that structure each different website

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,820
dynamic information we don't need like

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,890
to make every project I stand fire every

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,650
time now with that file which is new

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:34,700
ones and we can reuse in different

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:40,150
projects so that's functional I added

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:43,790
like inside the functions PHP so there

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:48,440
we cannot reuse that function different

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:53,840
projects so the icons I took from that

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:56,870
then we need a color for this definer

00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:02,720
like the background color of our home

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:03,660
screen and also the also they they cover

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,340
from the hell

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:12,270
like for our application so that's all

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:15,210
it took also from the Houston features

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:18,420
inside they on our Adam E so that the

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:20,700
previous talk also shall also be ocean

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,850
will how to change the power in the

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:27,060
footer we can like take that's called

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,770
from the footer or the heather but my

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,380
case I I took that fall from the

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,320
background so I use it the profit that

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,650
we are like resistant for the background

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,700
there just took that call in add in our

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:44,400
main special reason

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,190
so after then we we have this file but

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,370
we need means our application with our

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,940
minute right place on so that's first

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,610
line I just like follow this function so

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,160
it with that function we were gonna like

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,800
create movement such system will return

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:10,320
on this on for the different end of

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:15,570
power and after that we have our main

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,220
factors on what's a so these votes in

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,590
different applications we just need like

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:26,550
fill that information that we came my

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:29,690
opinion so we don't spend every time so

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,950
and whether we can check that inside the

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,710
inside the Google Chrome you have that

00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,130
that option application inside our

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:42,240
inspect panel there we can share the

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,610
service water the one five days zone

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:52,890
enough in the whole storage of wine

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:55,320
storage we can chapter so today who

00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:58,620
supports that feature this is important

00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,960
because Google always say Oh progress

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,020
with web apps is so nice and you can use

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,100
it at and Ruby you change your life oh

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:10,130
don't

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:13,550
okay the people are like this year

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:16,370
implement so Microsoft Aaron have inside

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:19,790
the Microsoft edge they have support for

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,790
that Firefox that stop so when we are

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,069
like when we should be like that fight

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,899
either version text contractions so the

00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:32,060
desktop version for Firefox and Chrome

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:35,630
doesn't have with nice we gonna like for

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:41,630
that Safari doesn't support yet but the

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:44,569
iOS Safari the Chrome for Android in

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:49,009
general browser woods so it's we are

00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:56,810
like think about FC solvers mobile phone

00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:58,790
so that's fine sometimes a incited

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,470
Twitter like but many people like me

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,810
tunes about them oh I will talk about

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,390
progressive web apps and I will show up

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:09,350
and fetch this song and um I finished my

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:12,110
presentation it's not that it's not true

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:14,390
okay it's not true why because we just

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,939
think all right installable but we need

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:20,839
create a reason for the user you know

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:22,760
that any news so it's not simple add an

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,669
icon and show on home screen

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,370
we need behind that as I experience

00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:31,990
that's that's it that makes it the user

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:34,820
goal in open users so how many we can

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:37,159
create that experience that we have

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,590
shared many libraries that we engage to

00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:42,460
us like many features but we need think

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:46,580
about that business it's not it's not an

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:51,020
offline things were soluble things we

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:54,320
need to create some better people we

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,490
have the feet above okay you need to go

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,800
back there and use

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,470
because we'll be useful that's simple

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,510
make the things useful and unit think

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:08,300
about that okay

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:10,640
say mr. Walker so service orchids it's a

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,640
base for the other features main

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:18,700
features are like it's a requirement for

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,700
for that as a service to work installer

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:27,220
in what what is a service worker

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,220
everybody hold a service and service

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:09,490
workers for group is is web suite that

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:11,840
we go to stop in our browser so and

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,179
that's great we'll run some background

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,400
it will fetch the whole paper they

00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:18,920
holding to that process between the web

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,400
to the application that service working

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,300
will watch that and we've done we can

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,250
create our caching guide offline version

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:36,110
questions pages so everything depends on

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:39,980
that and that's a simple wrap this one

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:43,100
my favorite episode of gumbo so about

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:47,570
the web how they describe how the web

00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:52,160
works it permits the banks this brief

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:54,770
about the web the service water will be

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,550
here in the middle watch everything that

00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:01,700
our application the web their

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:04,280
requirement for them the first thing bra

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,880
support our brows need to support them

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:12,440
simple and the second one is section PS

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,450
why it's our requirement because

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,320
something that watch everything that

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:21,260
passed between your browser and the web

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,080
they watch everything so need something

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,540
that's like okay that's applications see

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,850
you can do that you can watch that

00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:37,510
because there is any like with bad

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:44,559
intentions between you and the web okay

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:48,170
just stop many many hosted gate for free

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,000
yes but if you your host doesn't have

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,830
that that is like less than preparing

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,679
other places are you think wait the

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,679
certificate and Salah it appears in our

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:06,290
so install them the first thing the

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:11,840
first line here uncheck for support so

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:14,360
I'm gently in my navigator has feature

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,540
called by the service port and so if my

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,410
browser support service warm and after

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:24,800
that I will access my service worker in

00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:27,350
raster a JavaScript file say oh that's

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,460
zip file that will be gonna run in

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:33,800
background hey if everything was fine

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,990
we're gonna get a mess in your in your

00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,910
service for this register but here is we

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,710
we're gonna spoil our first problem why

00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:47,750
because the serviceworker

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:51,470
works with iscope what that means this

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,590
Pope is where that file is a solid he

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,230
will watch everything that came after

00:21:53,590 --> 00:22:00,470
so our javascript file is inside our

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,600
thing so our service for pictures

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,670
watch everything that's assigned our

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:10,010
feet but our application is so much for

00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:14,120
an hour finishing the route and we are

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,950
just like he access for I spoke that are

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,720
inside a theme so the whole paper that

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:21,440
runs outside that like the real

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,840
application its I said for the back for

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:35,150
that so we need to fix them and how we

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:40,400
gonna fix that I saw I saw to two

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:43,370
different solution one the guys from the

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,650
guys from Google they create a file PHP

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,860
file that changed a harder and gave

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:53,510
access for the service will show the

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:57,920
whole path and another solution I solve

00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:02,150
that that world HTTP that say that that

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,580
file s W dot Ria's has access for the

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,940
root folder so they have access for

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,640
everything inside your page so the

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:17,240
solution that I use it was the first one

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:19,160
I just change that address for HP v in

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,090
the PHP finest I my thing

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:26,090
change the nethers ago we can have

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:39,190
access for the world folder and after I

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:43,190
read read for my service so I choose

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:47,980
that is chuh chuh equal fees here it's

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,980
up we said that seems our job sweet

00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:04,130
sweet words and that's it

00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:08,360
three two thing I got that Nobu profits

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,460
that local profit I use it where we have

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,140
my English

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:16,900
get our squid and put it on inside

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:19,480
WordPress and also leaking crate inside

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:23,110
WordPress like global variables and I

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,050
just read that variable that storage our

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,720
template so in different applications we

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,240
gonna have a different place so I change

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,830
this that field item so that information

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:40,680
came from the WordPress later a I can

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:44,980
show you how how we can do that and our

00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:47,350
is my my phone inside 1990 and I just

00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:51,520
clarify or fix a scope that gonna change

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:53,710
the header NSS file for that service

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,050
walking that's this focus they want is

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,510
they school and after that our service

00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:07,200
for was fine and have access for their

00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:10,180
whole application so service work now

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,200
everyone was celebrating the main

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:17,950
browsers as important also add Firefox

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:24,250
Firefox glassman permits work of that

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:28,540
Chrome Safari and the mobile browsers as

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:31,090
support for now we have our service

00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,460
working now after that we're gonna

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:36,700
install our akashic yeah you're gonna

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,660
like cache our files inside their own

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:44,350
browser how that's what the first thing

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:47,470
we have our web application web

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:51,850
application there is different structure

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:55,210
than I think a to 90 strategy that shed

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:58,660
first the cache API or check first the

00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:01,600
web it doesn't find that file there or

00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:03,809
is you doesn't find that fire the web

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,809
root in the cache or we can

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:13,200
- or the opposite way the most popular

00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:16,259
is butcher shop it's Walker and after go

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,519
to the web get that file is charging

00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:23,070
your caching data and it boom in the

00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,059
next time when you access the same

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,539
application

00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:29,460
the servants will hear wish I okay URL

00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:32,669
have access for that fire we have some

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:36,629
things captured up chef if you have that

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:42,359
inside - so that cache API he started

00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:45,869
firing now our problem I think four

00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,879
years ago they they chrome the group the

00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:52,679
last version for chrome five years ago

00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:56,519
has storage for 25 megabytes that now so

00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:58,109
much figure what is it the good thing

00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,589
about that we can catch fire inside the

00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:01,200
browser

00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:05,070
the problem about that special in droid

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,669
if you use those cleaners Android and

00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,859
and they try to clean up your Android

00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,849
device they will clean up also that

00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,669
cache API

00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:17,700
so if you start something from that and

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:23,369
the users always get clean so that's

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:25,169
really good but let's me to help until

00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:28,649
they use a clean up after if inside

00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:32,009
Android or inside them they always move

00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:33,809
that finger up get up but if you have

00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:36,330
something inside the retention guy

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:38,669
returned to the user doesn't both we

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,099
don't need to go to the web he white

00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:43,679
he'll be going to the caching yard and

00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:51,029
if he didn't find something here okay

00:27:43,679 --> 00:28:28,230
closely where I find that and

00:27:51,029 --> 00:28:28,230
there are ok so if they are just in our

00:28:28,710 --> 00:29:00,580
every change and you and your users it

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:03,610
oh I am and think about the old-style

00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:09,399
files or I am deeply the old JavaScript

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:13,570
files and for that one thing that I use

00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:16,090
it that makes it simple there are two

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,659
two ways from to walk with that library

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:22,240
works for walk box it's a library that

00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:24,610
Google makes for service workers and

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,130
cache API so please

00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:31,539
the whole things people the most tragedy

00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:33,639
behind that a pretty framework that you

00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:34,539
just defined okay I wanna check first

00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:37,750
the Cascadia

00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:43,950
or I want to check first the web before

00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:43,950
you you start you look for files and

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:52,090
then equate it's available each other

00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:53,950
with shown then the last is like you

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,850
without looking

00:29:53,950 --> 00:30:01,630
I use webpack with work box there is a

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:09,480
library for web back that make more

00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:09,480
merciful and good most with web back

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:18,940
know so web every time we have those

00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:22,000
texts many test managers for example

00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:27,610
whooping grunt Oh what's with whooping

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:32,200
great cool so it's quite similar

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:34,600
but quite different web beg looks for

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,580
the files think about modules so we can

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:41,140
import everything as modules and they

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:45,790
have like the one scope inside that

00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:48,460
scope we think everything we think about

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:53,140
everything as modules and we define

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:56,169
rules how to read best files so inside

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:59,530
that that config file we need to do two

00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:04,360
things the first thing is are they would

00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:10,870
box well thankfully that's the first

00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:13,809
step and the last step is create our

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:15,549
service walk with that bloom so that

00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:19,210
whole structure that I showed like

00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:22,120
before the two slides of like 40 lines

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:27,160
we're gonna change for the three lines

00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:29,790
is something like make okay but there

00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:34,260
are some particular points here that

00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:38,200
that met that we are doing here is a

00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:42,250
seafoam and we just do like free cash

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:46,720
flow files and the deploy step we just

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:49,240
do like free cache files okay we're

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,350
gonna do my some different strategy or

00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,160
like for example or the user is offline

00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:58,370
when they hit my root folder

00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:01,310
I wanna get back fall back fiber for

00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:06,200
example HTML I stick or a state condom

00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:10,100
just with the email address my location

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:13,760
and basic formation that the user like

00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:16,760
him not talk with my client were doing

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,220
some things are the kitchen so if we

00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,580
need to do something different like like

00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:25,640
that we need to learn our lessons Jeff

00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:30,080
when fast in that file we need to do

00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:52,940
more steps but that previous line that I

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:56,240
sure like for clients we work with so in

00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:02,630
structure of money structure also

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:06,530
because I will show after when when we

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:08,840
use work boss and one box will read our

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,930
files inside we're back every file that

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:17,600
web pack reads inside that the creator

00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:22,880
of my impression for that file ok it's

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,770
finger so because we create like rules

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,740
for saying oh well thank you we would

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:30,470
like to watch like every image that

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,530
reads so when we take that image okay

00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:36,440
put in the cache and give a hash for

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:40,820
that guy and we give you that that's

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:44,840
fire again clean that hash for like the

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:48,679
in that file so and we have that three

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,929
options runs and what are you do more

00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,570
because I just put that color difference

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:56,480
because the things that we solved before

00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:59,539
it's something specifically for

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,960
WordPress so we need to go that way for

00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:07,089
WordPress we can do a different way in

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:11,500
just like take our step file is set like

00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:14,450
service won't input in our root file but

00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:19,190
we'll be outside our fee if you want to

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:21,230
like reduce that we need to remember

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:28,369
that there is a service work and someone

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:32,480
else runs that or if you when we want to

00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:34,790
do that night dynamically also that

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,740
feeling like one because we'll be

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:43,220
outside our fee and after then we can do

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:46,940
everything we can even use view we can

00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:50,569
use angular we can use atmosphere

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:55,159
ceilings for managing those things and

00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:58,099
show some native features and the

00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,190
examples that I use it I just put a like

00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:03,440
our matron social share time it's

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:08,089
something that inside Google Chrome is a

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,030
new API when you share something it's

00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:13,910
not a Facebook share is the native share

00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:16,880
when we clearly call that sparked that

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,859
shows us of how to share something

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,460
inside our phone it's something unique

00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:24,380
it is not it's not my gems of science

00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:31,069
for the de browser and call something

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:37,599
inside our their parts so one example

00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:40,400
that I use it in that thing I just said

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:46,040
when our app it's offline you know wine

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,309
and I just add a class in our body like

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:52,099
that the body or our application

00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:54,890
for a while they might do different

00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:59,299
things with for example one thing that

00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:02,809
made our use it like both peroxide the

00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:06,140
user write a comment I can check if the

00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:10,189
users of line take that comment in of

00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:13,809
the browser and wait until the users get

00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:18,859
a line again and send that comment right

00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:19,729
because if we don't do that what gonna

00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:23,239
happen right

00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:25,759
the user will try send the comment will

00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:30,920
try and eat our server and say oh this

00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:33,890
request doesn't work or user so we can

00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:38,179
control that flow so when you check if

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:40,489
you the user is offline we just keep

00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:43,939
that information wait from the browser's

00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:48,469
you oh man again is sent up and the user

00:36:43,939 --> 00:36:51,229
think that the comments just John let's

00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:53,299
do that okay another thing we cannot

00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:56,689
show enough in some way like for example

00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:59,329
I just had a class in our body and I

00:36:56,689 --> 00:37:04,059
show a different header when they use it

00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:04,059
like a game of line then either change

00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,170
so that's application

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:47,820
just a local I have the Installer I will

00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:47,820
show but the fees that happen

00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,770
when every application what we might

00:37:57,549 --> 00:38:02,530
have like those are flying here that

00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:03,579
pool had to change to black that's the

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:13,119
team that happened

00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:15,520
that code so we we can check that like

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,430
when do you use a lot of minor of mining

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:23,109
do some like he was super just change a

00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:27,970
class where we can do like more Onegin

00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:31,260
stair with that API we can call our

00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:31,260
share time so

00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,159
[Music]

00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:59,049
when a so when I click alone when I

00:38:55,779 --> 00:39:03,539
click to share we just call the negative

00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:03,539
Charlotte's key it's working

00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:14,249
one thing that can do another thing that

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:18,999
I use in verification something simple

00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:26,170
in our link webpage yes we can use that

00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:30,640
that is something you Ju so that's when

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:33,970
we click on on that because they were

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,059
and we came the same through our users

00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:44,319
the latitudinal moves to in the title

00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:47,499
for for the tag and our man but this is

00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:50,680
one thing that just walks in with like a

00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:53,769
great point and I in here I just made a

00:39:50,680 --> 00:40:00,160
fallback that checks if you're the users

00:39:53,769 --> 00:40:06,509
are iOS users if it's just open like

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:10,210
match.com and information and iOS man

00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:11,769
okay so that's three things like this is

00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,029
just like there are many things that we

00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:16,210
can do after that

00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:19,210
but the speak about life after the

00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:23,170
service worker like you can do

00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:28,359
everything for dinner so sharing the I

00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:31,450
who is there Colleen Maps integration

00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:34,089
with other halves something that works

00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:37,559
like in the desktop version I it's

00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:37,559
another for back mate

00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:56,390
we'll be quick share I just made a whole

00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:58,369
bag for call or what's up if my brother

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,710
doesn't have support for share and me

00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:05,690
share I can share that same information

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:08,059
on what's up so that will happen on a

00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:19,609
phone and also another so if I waited

00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:22,640
here will open my my what's up so after

00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:25,940
that three change hours for when two

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,690
from twenty seventy two ways to about a

00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:31,970
choice it's quite good but just remember

00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,710
like that well spin like they're the

00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,769
main things not like just that number

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:39,410
they make things their user experience

00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:41,779
just when you go to do something like go

00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:44,180
to improve your application pick about

00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:46,609
the users think about how we can prove

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,869
them and use those features to make

00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:52,430
those lives better

00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:55,960
okay so and that was the results with

00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:59,630
those two three chains like after so

00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:02,960
also I use an HTTP that improve with

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:06,700
that number and any chippy to that's

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,560
what helps you twist at that score and

00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:14,179
that

00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,179
