Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	Today’s WordPress environment generally results in numerous organisations managing either our data or the hardware and software that it relies upon.
Although we subcontract out parts of our WordPress infrastructure we are still accountable for the data processed by our Websites.
This talk takes a look at a typical WordPress set up and follows the journey that a user’s data might take and some potential threats at each point on its journey.
It looks at what we can do to minimise our exposure to risk of outsourcing management of our infrastructure, the considerations we should make and what questions we should be asking of our hosts.
