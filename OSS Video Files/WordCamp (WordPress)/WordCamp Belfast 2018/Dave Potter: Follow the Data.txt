Title: Dave Potter: Follow the Data
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	Today’s WordPress environment generally results in numerous organisations managing either our data or the hardware and software that it relies upon.
Although we subcontract out parts of our WordPress infrastructure we are still accountable for the data processed by our Websites.
This talk takes a look at a typical WordPress set up and follows the journey that a user’s data might take and some potential threats at each point on its journey.
It looks at what we can do to minimise our exposure to risk of outsourcing management of our infrastructure, the considerations we should make and what questions we should be asking of our hosts.

right hi there everybody has quite an

00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,480
introduction to them or two but what

00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,029
imma do today is talk a bit about data

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,099
security but not in the traditional way

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:25,550
so what comes up a bit more than it

00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:26,899
takes it can take about five minutes to

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,829
get a wordpress site up and running

00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:32,989
these days very simple very quick but

00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:37,640
it's easy when we do things that quickly

00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:40,489
to lose sight that we've got anywhere

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,440
between one and thousands of users that

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:45,949
are using that site that we've just

00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,070
created and we have a responsibility to

00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:51,190
ensure that the data we capture within

00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,510
that site is looked after

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,949
GPR has brought that into legislation

00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:03,769
but some of the things I'm going to talk

00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:07,100
about today although GDR gdpr imply some

00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:09,649
of it it doesn't actually explicitly

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,299
talk about it resources that we need to

00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:17,990
look after so the way wanna do is honor

00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:22,820
follow hangar data floats root system

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:26,950
from the point of the user onwards so

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:32,210
one name as well might be mighty since

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:36,110
1977 during that time often pretty much

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,090
every role with the IT technical support

00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,320
and the lobotomy I'm now approaching

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,799
manager for the DBA work development

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,500
work or ever and just to put that day's

00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,590
into perspective about six years before

00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,909
the internet that's eight years before

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,100
mobile phones

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,280
that's the eleven years before laptops

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,880
but seventeen years before the web and

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,710
26 years before

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:12,680
yes in other words I'm old does Peter

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:16,200
say I've seen a fair bit the things I'm

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,170
we need to think about what should we

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,290
really care about users data well it's

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,790
the right thing to do and now that's

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:31,080
been put into legislation we do BPI to

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:35,360
bolster that failure it's important that

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,980
we remember that we subcontract

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,610
responsibilities sometimes to third

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,610
parties

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:46,620
but when we do that we're not

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:53,130
subcontracting our accountability we're

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:56,010
still accountable for our websites we

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,230
need to ask questions of those people

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,110
that we subcontractor to make sure that

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,230
they are going to protect our users data

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,290
in the way we need them to and the way

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,609
our customers would expect us to do our

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,720
own so I'm not going to going to the GDP

00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:15,630
are sort of these

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,030
hey there was on earlier before me we've

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,560
got this great new feature within

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,569
WordPress as of the latest reboot

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:33,840
release which gives us the privacy

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:36,959
policy absolutely brilliant pink one any

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,769
one of those great and I'm not going to

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,700
talk about the traditional stuff about

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,750
secure twosies Morrissey's hat King

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,400
security plugins and all that sort of

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,620
stuff if you want to know about that I

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,560
would recommend to go to impress steeply

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:57,750
again and looking at a talk from kid now

00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:00,450
she does is the sprite to a master so

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,329
let's start out doing first of all we

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,940
start with our users and their devices

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:08,480
we have no

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:11,180
roll over this at all we have no way of

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,910
knowing what the what the users will get

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:19,010
onto and believe me they can get up to

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:22,630
pretty much anything so we'll leave that

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:27,890
bit alone because we can't control it

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:31,130
first stop on our users data weather

00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:35,810
when we get our visitors coming to our

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:40,910
website it's the date sensor now these

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:45,290
days data centers are either one of two

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,320
things they're either a very large data

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:54,440
center that's sitting as a cloud service

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:58,280
so aka Amazon Microsoft but it could be

00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,400
a bespoke data center that's being used

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,550
people like Rackspace UK fast telly have

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,610
saw blade room important thing about

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:11,990
this is or the important information we

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:14,270
need to be conscious of is where that

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,960
data center is because where that data

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:21,169
center is is likely to impact what the

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:28,820
legal jurisdiction is the governs up

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:33,620
data center so for instance if that data

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:37,790
center is in the US and the people who

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,720
own it a part of the pretty shoe for

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,050
about that later

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,760
that's probably okay however if that

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:50,390
data center is somewhere in the Far East

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:55,940
then what level of security privacy and

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:58,270
care and they advise to look to use for

00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,270
our data

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,710
doesn't it is who owns the

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,750
infrastructure within that data center

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:15,480
because that again decides who may have

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:23,310
access to that information so for

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:26,490
instance if somebody in government and

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:31,080
the Pharisees bodied that they wanted to

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:34,830
click data about voters who voted

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,810
against them you know recent election so

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:42,420
they take action against them in some

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:46,560
way you're targeting me some way what

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:50,970
where the data center infrastructure who

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:54,060
only base s infrastructure me that that

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:59,400
own would have to give up that data to

00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:02,190
whoever it is it's asking for it no it's

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,580
not going to happen right this very

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,580
likely

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:18,760
when it comes to of dissipation Cruces

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,750
yields but there's also something in EU

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:28,820
legislation called adequacy and the EU

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:34,180
has listed a series of countries that

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:39,890
are deemed to have privacy legislation

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:43,550
but meet any requirements so there's the

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:45,950
looseness as he stands at the moment you

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,900
will notice that the u.s. is in there

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,050
but it's limited to something called the

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,260
premises shield framework or level

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,270
because I'm in just a minute

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,820
what we'll see is that that means it's

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,240
not all of the u.s. it's a subset

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,240
thereof

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:16,630
so Percy shield who remembers something

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,630
called safe harbor safe harbor was a

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,130
what should we call it it was an

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,520
agreement that the EU had with the US

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,260
where the USS yeah Europe we understands

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,960
that you've got all these proof theory

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,150
requirements we will actually set some

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,750
in comfortable safe harbor which says we

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:37,130
will adhere to your privacy level of

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,770
legislation if we're going to do

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:46,310
business with you guys well basically

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:48,380
the u.s. trouble over it you you through

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,000
the toys that the promises say farmers

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,060
the work where Bishop goes you promise

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,070
me do this you haven't so it's all over

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,839
you know we're not great you're not

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,230
gonna let basis be exported out to you

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,740
anymore

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,470
so the USS well hold on we'll get

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,910
something to place let us carry off a

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,270
little bit with us what would get ours

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:12,080
in order and what came out of that was

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:15,100
criticize shield now there's a few

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,490
things to remember about proof shield I

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:22,850
hear only applies to the US be in only

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:27,160
employs two specific companies in the US

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:32,080
that sign up to the primitive shield and

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,910
those companies self certify themselves

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,589
nobody comes along and says right giving

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,260
you documentation let's see with you

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,750
whether you comply a lot now they

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,680
basically add themselves to the list and

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:48,950
say yeah well all complied would be fine

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:53,240
the only way that they will be reviewed

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:57,170
is if somebody makes a complaint against

00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,320
them or if something happens to actually

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,110
bring them to the attention of the US

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,870
government in terms of

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:10,540
breaking the British ingredients I

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:14,350
thought today I'd sleeve this was as of

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:18,550
a few weeks ago there was 2007 39

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:20,200
company certified by the US Department

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,709
of Commerce within the US that looks

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,019
after them and you can build that list

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:29,920
of companies any time just by going to

00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:36,990
the previous yield site and going to the

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:42,790
list they're easy to find it's not

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:45,550
completely bought into by everybody in

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:52,480
the EU there's a group called the WP r

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:56,290
WP 29 committee but looks at this and

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,010
they are not completely happy with the

00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,950
whole thing

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,290
they feel that the the way the previous

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,980
yielded requires people to look after

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:12,100
particularly human resource beta is 2

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:13,810
lakhs and needs beefing up and that then

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,000
will be ongoing discussions around this

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,329
but right now it's the best we've got in

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,050
terms of dealing with companies in the

00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:25,720
u.s. so just to sort of put that in

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:29,130
context right most of you that's got

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:39,910
beta sitting out there with Dropbox

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:44,949
mounted with Microsoft so they fit into

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:47,199
the premises yield requirements and

00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:49,660
you'll find that that pretty much all in

00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,070
there it's interesting to see in that

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,610
it's interesting to see

00:11:51,070 --> 00:12:03,550
he was not in there if he had checked

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:05,589
the list this business about some

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:12,310
political party wanting to find out

00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:15,209
about their voters and insisted that the

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:20,800
dates that he gives up the information

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:28,000
happened the US Department Tom Facebook

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:31,930
they wanted details of everybody one day

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:38,250
they told them they wanted full details

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:44,829
of a facebook site where the owners were

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:49,660
putting out anti-trump messages during

00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:52,420
the election because they felt that the

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,579
Mata besom election really going on in

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,130
some way shape or form both they weren't

00:12:54,579 --> 00:13:01,839
exactly clear about what hat might have

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:05,440
come about or whatever and so he could

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:10,569
sort of see that somebody's got a site

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:16,240
that basically trying to influence a

00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:18,940
voting an election the problem was it

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,160
wasn't just the owners of that Facebook

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:28,600
site but the Trump administration must

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:35,439
be mandated it was everybody who liked

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:38,920
that site so if if somebody both posted

00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:42,610
up early humorous comments on that site

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:48,040
from burners we found it funny now like

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:49,920
that that might have been your details

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:56,980
that Facebook was

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:59,199
has been connected with that website the

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:04,660
net one I just want to talk about is

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:08,290
that the Department of Justice sayings

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,889
that can demand every email from every

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:14,769
any us-based provider regardless of

00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:17,019
where the data center is it's pertinent

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,870
one for this meeting because it was all

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:22,949
about information about a particular

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:29,370
person that was of interest regarding

00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:34,209
Druce and their data was sitting on the

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:38,529
mondo soft Irish data center and the

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:39,220
table Justice says know your HQ is in

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:42,720
the US

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,699
therefore your fall under US legislation

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,939
therefore we demand you give up that

00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,939
data

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:57,579
Microsoft fought against it it went to

00:14:53,069 --> 00:15:00,550
court in 2014 the FBI uses the law of 13

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:06,040
from 1899 to set to still communication

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:08,889
up to ask for the emails once I've said

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,329
no just is departed their normal but

00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,699
hundreds if not thousands the

00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:15,970
investigation is tearing the terrorism

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:17,589
and child pornography our people will be

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,259
hampered by the government's inability

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:25,540
to obtain electronic evidence if you go

00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:28,059
down this route which means they

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,029
basically sort of lost Montes office or

00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:35,889
a lot however then let it go

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:38,529
they peeling and the Supreme Court

00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:41,649
issued a writ sync in a judicial review

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:44,420
in October 2017 and the case will be

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:46,220
heard again later this year

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,550
shipments be heard again later this year

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,860
but he just goes to show right you've

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,290
got company that's in the previous shift

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:58,220
you've got a datacenter that's sitting

00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:02,720
in Europe and you've got a political

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:06,890
regime or a legislative organization

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:11,530
that's insisting that Norman of the EU

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:15,200
legislation applies is in this instance

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:19,010
so this is why we need to be careful

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,620
about where data centers are reached

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,660
your suspicion they fall into and who

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,930
owns that infrastructure within the data

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:32,590
center because all of those things can

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:35,480
cause add users data to be insisted upon

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:38,180
by somebody that you weren't expecting

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,370
I mean it's not about whether it's right

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,040
or not it's about what our customers

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:50,120
expect it's the expectations we need to

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:54,040
satisfy so that's the data center the

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:57,200
next place on our journey is the host

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,840
which generally won't happen ease we'd

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,470
come back a day from the other way we

00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:06,320
were a host to host a a website the host

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:12,410
will then have a data center that where

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,880
they put the data once again the

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,570
location of that host and the

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,209
jurisdiction he falls into he's just as

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,579
important where the data centuries

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:24,530
because they have control over our data

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,410
within that data center what we

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,390
generally don't have direct access is

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:34,720
the data center when you go through our

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,720
host or athos systems one way shape or

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,510
so

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:46,220
worries it we should be looking at when

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:51,440
we look for a host the things I look for

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:56,650
right do they provide SSL Certificates

00:17:51,440 --> 00:18:00,020
finale 3 I've recently moved from a

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:03,020
website provider simply because they

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:06,049
wanted some 160-pound a certificate for

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,730
an SSL certificate ridiculous

00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:12,580
these days you've got an open source

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:17,390
organization called wet secret they

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:19,520
offer SSL certificates to anybody who

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,460
wants to print charge or any hosting

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,470
company free of charge and what

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,360
Sapperstein companies will provide that

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,919
on to their customers free of charge

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,590
there's no reason we should be paying

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,419
for SSL certificates these days if you

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,090
say everybody know what an SSL

00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:40,790
certificate is and reap does tons of

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:43,370
people don't write SSL certificate when

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:46,190
you go to the website you see the little

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:50,419
padlock the terms up and it starts how

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:53,630
to TT PS at least in HTTP that means

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:56,120
your data is encrypted over the network

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,419
right and to do that you need a

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:04,190
certificate to initiate that and that's

00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:09,070
what the SSL certificate is does the

00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:12,830
host provide SS SFTP and SSH access

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:17,990
right so what we want to load up changes

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:19,700
to our WordPress code the way we might

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,429
want to do that is through the form

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,070
transfer mechanism SFTP

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:29,360
is the secure version that were for

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:35,179
transfer mechanism SSH gives the same

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:37,730
secure access to the command line within

00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,770
the operating system that's running our

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,450
WordPress

00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,049
why on earth will we need access to the

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,080
command line

00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:46,370
what if you want to use this little guy

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,830
that are here

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,120
WPC airline

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,160
the seal is that's the command-line

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,060
interface so you need to be able to get

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,890
man wife you know what's use it W PCI

00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:02,160
why would you want to use to be PC line

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:08,580
all sorts of things if you want to talk

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:13,740
to Iran about we're talking about being

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:16,680
able to disable plugins when you've got

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,080
a a white screen if that's what's caused

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,520
it do all sorts of things from cran

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,760
lines to face whether you eyes

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,680
completely dead in water plus it's a

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,290
great way of alternating stuff you can

00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,940
run scripts from the work from the

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,900
command line interface which means you

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:38,160
can automate things brilliant so do they

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,860
give us SH access into that what backups

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,400
facilities are provided by the host do

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:50,220
you want to use them if you do

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:52,320
where are they stored an interesting

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:56,600
thing I'm a quick look at the term

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,640
editions of mine hosting provider and

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:06,620
when you came to backups I found this

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:08,490
little statement in the maternity dishes

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,350
hosting provider shall not be

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,450
responsible nor liable pretty lost

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,910
damage cost their expenses or other

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,860
claims has River arising for

00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,150
compensation for any days they follow

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,650
the rule the material being damaged

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:24,630
corrupted or otherwise affected how many

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:28,760
of you've got your hosts doing your

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:33,090
backup for you and story about those

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,490
what did you know might be something can

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,710
you does give you that said that if we

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,890
lose all your backup data nothing to do

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,680
with a spell come on bus responsible now

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:47,130
I'm not worried I don't keep any more

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,190
backups with my hosts because if one

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:52,460
host goes down hey look it's not that

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,460
those

00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,480
what does that mean it means I can't go

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,340
to another host if they tell me if you

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,980
if again you look into the terms of

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:06,010
conditions of this of this host it talks

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,770
about it be reasonable that they get 30

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:12,700
days to get your system back repeat what

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:14,650
we're doing in extreme cases right am I

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,020
please wait 30 days to get my websites

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,560
back up already know what go to build a

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,790
house even if it's only temporarily I

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,620
can't do that if I can't get to my

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,620
backups to restore them somewhere else

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:34,750
when I went looking for a new hosting

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,830
company the way we did it was on my list

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:42,220
of the questions I wanted to ask go into

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,320
word camp London Oh some poster but wait

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,200
Ram and ask them every question and

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,700
wanting to that it was brilliant well

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,490
the end of it for the end of the word

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,220
camp I'm the only found a host that I

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,500
liked that gave me all the answers I

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,560
wanted or the correct answers I want

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,680
each the questions I was asking but that

00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:05,110
helped me migrate one first three sites

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:31,540
over to them before I left the

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:33,880
conference yes I'm sure

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,340
if push came to shove they would hang

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,040
off that because that's great guys right

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,260
or will they just give you a quick story

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:45,030
on a species of because I'm starting to

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,030
get sort of wine that's like things I

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:59,739
found this little notice in a host now

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,599
grief you sell the the story behind this

00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:04,599
was it's an illustration of something

00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:07,389
happened today I was being I one more

00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:11,349
site to be hosted by friends who used a

00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:15,820
third party host for multiple hosting

00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:18,879
facilities and that host beside there

00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:23,769
was unusual traffic coming from my

00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:26,440
website so because my website that new

00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,729
Persis they didn't want taken up all

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,460
their bandwidth because for a host

00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:32,769
that's their most expensive commodity

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,809
the bandwidth so anybody who gets

00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:36,340
unusual traffic they closed them down

00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:39,429
until they figure out what's going on

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,570
and then you know they protect everybody

00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:43,889
else from my problem

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:48,720
I promise didn't just shut my site down

00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:52,509
they just so might have mine there's the

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,470
V the VM that I've got all my sites on

00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:58,029
they shut the whole server down so my

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,580
friend that was hosting something like a

00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:07,599
dozen different clients on that server

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:11,259
lost everybody on that server and it all

00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,970
turned out after a weekend of badging

00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:15,070
because they wouldn't give us giving

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,019
access to look at the logs to try and

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,570
find out what was wrong because the

00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:21,809
server was closed off to it and they

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:26,049
couldn't find out who would absolutely

00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:28,299
spotted the unusual activity or where

00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,299
the problem had been lost in their fault

00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:33,039
logging system as he found out that it

00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:34,479
wasn't any unusual activities at all

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,299
somebody just been a bit overzealous

00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:44,049
pull the plug on us wait was that for a

00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:46,989
weekend the model this story is is it's

00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:51,129
not whether or not they pull the plug on

00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:52,929
you because they know but you're not

00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:55,749
going to get away from that question is

00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:57,700
is how they handle that we weren't

00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:59,080
informed the first thing we do about it

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,580
was around my trying to get to my site

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,039
it wasn't there a phone of my friends is

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,430
with me site on then he phoned them

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,390
offices oh yeah we took it down

00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:13,020
so they didn't tell us they took the

00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:15,930
whole server right they wouldn't let us

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,700
look at the logs to fix it so we didn't

00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:23,340
know what was going on so we could so we

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:25,320
could fit that as I say it's not what do

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:34,080
you have a problem it's how they deal

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:40,380
with the problem so finally the journey

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:42,930
ease the planet what hands of anybody in

00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:50,210
this room that doesn't use the cloud to

00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:54,060
hold data yet that's where I thought so

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:57,420
once again it's a bit like the hosting

00:26:54,060 --> 00:27:01,530
side of things there's a couple extra

00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:04,200
things to think about here when you use

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:09,330
when you use your cloud service to store

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:11,820
data is encrypted it encrypted is it

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:17,730
just encrypted on their server or is

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:19,080
encrypted from your client Dropbox but

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,120
don't know whether they still do it or

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,540
whether post got mad but certainly a

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,080
year ago it was everything was encrypted

00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:32,490
on their server side but everything went

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,380
in plain from your client streams of

00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,590
Dropbox so all that simply that goes on

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,750
the Dropbox or the do the player over

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,630
the network and only includes when they

00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,090
get your friend on by the way their

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,940
stuff at the other end

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:50,130
how about just to be pretty keys so if

00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:54,390
there is to give updated by their

00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:57,330
government then they can't say they

00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:01,230
can't do it because they have a testing

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,690
pretty please it's not true of all those

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,909
services the reason

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,849
imprisonment which is based at

00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:12,349
Switzerland that encrypts at the client

00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:13,639
end as well and they basically just put

00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:16,340
the hands of the people you ask for the

00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:18,379
practice and there's then ask first we

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:21,049
haven't got the keys we can't be with

00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:23,149
you the only problem is if you go to a

00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,279
service like that you're responsible for

00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:27,109
the encryption key you lose that

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,090
encryption key you've lost on you data

00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:34,009
because they don't know if you're the

00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:36,739
only person it does what bad officers

00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:40,580
isn't providing boy in cloud storage

00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:42,999
provider Dropbox by solutioning so you

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,690
go back in opera versions we've Dropbox

00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:49,099
let's get one thing straight

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:51,409
that's not backup right only gets you

00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:52,340
back a few versions if you need to go

00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:57,830
back further

00:28:52,340 --> 00:29:00,529
you've had it your thing is the habit

00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:04,779
just a few days ago is do they provided

00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:04,779
a data protection agreement

00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:10,549
conversations I'm saying

00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:12,769
couple months ago and looking at the

00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:15,470
forums of Dropbox it will suggest that

00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:17,989
if you haven't got a business account

00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,570
with Dropbox that doesn't include plus

00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:23,080
it doesn't include standard they will

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:26,119
not give you data processing agreement

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:29,200
which you need if you are storing that

00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:34,970
used data on their cloud services and

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:38,059
the gbpm and of course think about apply

00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:40,749
this then the question where it is where

00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,749
that dangerous

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:51,420
on the backup side of things some other

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,030
precious saucy self is what format your

00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:58,320
backups it is he something the standard

00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:01,050
like parsing zip SQL or is it a

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:05,100
propriety format this is a propriety

00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:09,330
format if your host or your backup

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:13,380
software has a problem ghost go south

00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:15,690
can you still get to your backups have

00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,550
you got some sort of software that

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,130
they've given you to be able to get to

00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,890
it if you've got to move if you go to

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:25,790
somewhere else does the receiving system

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:29,010
support the format that you've got it in

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:31,710
have you tested your backups there's an

00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:38,790
old saying NIT is if you've got a backup

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:40,920
it's not tested in a bucket so yeah have

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,420
you got somewhere you test it an old PC

00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,580
where you put a local copy of WordPress

00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,010
probably still into that virtual machine

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,040
there's lots of ways you do it some

00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:54,270
hosts like the one that on with provides

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,920
actually a staging area free of charge

00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:07,140
where you can actually do that sort of

00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:09,690
restore almost finally make a plan so if

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,630
something does go wrong make the plan of

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,560
what you didn't do about it when you

00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:19,130
make that plan

00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:24,480
consider a number of things passwords

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:27,050
does whoever's every story system of you

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,420
or somebody else know the passwords

00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,200
emails we lose your emails at the same

00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,320
time as you

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,090
WordPress site can you get messages out

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,320
to your customers can they get messages

00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:42,960
to you issue the main name service with

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,690
the host that's just got Bank which

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,370
means you can have all sorts of grief

00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:51,809
moving that service to somebody else

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:55,490
like possible this is a pain would you

00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:58,409
be a available or will you as a

00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:59,700
WordPress person who wins an absolute

00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,080
fortune be sitting on the beach in

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,909
Mauritius for three weeks

00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,620
as part of you for holidays a year when

00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:11,190
it all goes back and you can't get back

00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:16,409
or don't even know something and he got

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:20,130
a communication plan what happens the

00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:22,980
data that's between losing that system

00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:26,309
and your last backup if you've got an

00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,889
e-commerce site and you're taking

00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:31,320
thousands of transactions a day or even

00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:33,960
a week if it's been a week since you

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,519
took your last backup what are you going

00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,139
to do about those transactions you just

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:43,380
lost what's what you plan to keep your

00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:46,500
customers happy you can't plan for every

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:50,330
event so you need some sort of backstop

00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,330
plan to deal with you an expected

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:58,529
that's all heavy stuff but you know this

00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:02,460
time is it it's not because what you've

00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:05,159
got a plan you can market it share you

00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,440
plan with customers and visitors and if

00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,750
you've got a privacy policy you can

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,880
stick it in there you can tell everybody

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,059
just how great you are looking after

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,090
their data it also means you can set

00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:20,370
service levels with customers and get

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,529
them to pay a premium for those service

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,909
levels because you're obviously that

00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:25,909
your competitors may not

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,670
so just to recap we've got three real

00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,720
places we should be looking at taking

00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:42,570
care of at mr. Slater

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,340
there's the Vet Center and that's we are

00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:48,090
we should be looking up where that is

00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:50,940
and what you station comes in to the

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,980
hosts do they have access to your data

00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,370
do they provide answer substance if you

00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,950
kids do then write SFTP SSH do they

00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:01,080
provide it to be PC a line what do you

00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:04,920
stitch into they fall in dough and then

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,710
your own data have you got encryption

00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,790
salty dads do you know what version

00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,190
recovery

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:14,040
you've got of what restrictions are

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:20,840
around up and having plans to sort it

00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,840
out finally I'm going to read you a poem

00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:26,520
if you know worried about your backups

00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,340
up when all about you are losing theirs

00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,679
and blaming it on the hosts if you can

00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,050
trust your recovery one when all that

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,899
what to do but make allowance for

00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:39,270
unexpected missions too if you can be

00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:41,810
commenting you take while recovering or

00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:44,700
being shouted out have all the answers

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:47,520
or be hassles don't get ways of

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,250
panicking and yet don't look too good or

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,010
blending under this if you could talk we

00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:56,310
support and keep your pride or walk we

00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,260
techies nor lose the common touch many

00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:01,110
the days are lots nor recovery format

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,110
technology all customers can't with you

00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:06,150
but not too much if you can fill the

00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:09,000
unforgiving minute with sixty seconds

00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,610
worth and those and recover yours is the

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,400
web set website and everything that's in

00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:18,500
it and which is more you'll still be in

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:23,400
business my son and apologies to the job

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:26,330
so that's me you can get me it's any one

00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,330
