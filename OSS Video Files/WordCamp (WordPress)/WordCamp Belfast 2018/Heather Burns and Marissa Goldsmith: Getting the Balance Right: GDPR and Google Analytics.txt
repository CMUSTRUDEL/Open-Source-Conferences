Title: Heather Burns and Marissa Goldsmith: Getting the Balance Right: GDPR and Google Analytics
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	The web sites and apps we create, both for ourselves and for our clients, need to collect user analytics for a range of reasons ranging from workflow to user experience to security.
However, user tracking can cross the line from insightful anonymised data collection to intrusive personally identifiable monitoring. GDPR, Europe’s revamp of its data protection and privacy regime, becomes enforceable on 25 May – the day before WordCamp Belfast.
The incoming ePrivacy Directive revamp also renews rules on analytics. This double overhaul creates refreshed obligations for you to inform your site users about any counting, tracking, and monitoring you carry out on your web sites and apps, to provide users with options over your counting and tracking, and to ensure that your data collection respects your visitors privacy.
In our talk, we will help you to achieve a healthy balance between data collection and privacy which respects your business, your users, and your refreshed legal obligations.
Our talk will cover:
How to understand your audience so that you can understand their data
Why minimal data collection and retention makes sense from an ethical perspective
What user tracking is and is not permitted under GDPR as well as the ePrivacy Directive revamp
How to explain your use of analytics and tracking in your privacy notices
How to provide your visitors with an opt-out of analytics and tracking
How to collect analytics with the greatest respect for user privacy
How to ensure information is not personally identifiable to an individual (Deaggregation/anonymisation/pseudonymisation)
How to determine a data retention and deletion period
Dealing with third party tools: Google Analytics as our example
What other forms of tracking cross ethical and legal boundaries

so thank you for coming

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,860
I can't even improve on that

00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,780
introduction so thank you very much Alba

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,720
actually said we're going to talk about

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,899
the GPR and Google Analytics because

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,329
we've both been getting absolutely daily

00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:25,270
loosed with questions about this both on

00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:26,349
the legal on the technical side so we

00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,050
thought let's just put our heads

00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:30,550
together and do this talk and cover all

00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,820
the ground from two very different

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,820
perspectives

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,180
Melissa's based in Washington as I said

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,490
she has a former web developer she has

00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,780
some very shameful government orders in

00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:49,140
the past I saw them and she is now a

00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,910
full-time google analytics specialist

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,000
most of us have used Google Analytics

00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,800
but we've only done maybe 2% logged in

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,290
to set up an account she does all the

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,230
crazy advanced stuff the deep dives the

00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:05,790
advanced settings that's what she's

00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,790
really glad she's here because I think

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,750
she's the creator of an absolutely

00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,750
appalling collection of 1990s pop music

00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:23,170
and she's no album and this is Heather

00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,220
Heather is based in Glasgow which I only

00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,670
learned how to properly pronounce

00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,340
yesterday she is also a former web

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,950
designer and she is now a full-time

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,790
digital law expert again if you google

00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,290
gdpr you're gonna see Heather's name

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,979
this is her gazillion thwart camp or I

00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,930
guess 18 and she has an exquisite

00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:47,049
collection of French pop music of which

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:52,000
I see no appeal and she is so not a

00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:55,990
lawyer so we're going to cover it is

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,220
other side from both the legal and the

00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,920
technical perspective we're going to

00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,600
talk about what you need to know which

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,020
is the changing European privacy

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,360
framework what means what how the right

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,210
to be informed impacts

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,070
Linux and a set on melissa is going to

00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,680
talk about what you need to do to

00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,240
actually configure Google Analytics for

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
what we feel is a happy middle ground

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,410
for optimal user privacy we're going to

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,690
talk about risks beyond everyday

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,060
analytics specifically an aggregation a

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,580
couple of analytics issues we wanted you

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,220
to be aware of and for privacy notices

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,620
so I'm going to start talking about the

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,000
legal side but what you can do to not

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,740
hold sleep while I'm doing that is if

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,620
you have your laptop on Google Analytics

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,080
account get in open it up and log in

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,459
because she's going to tell you exactly

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,280
what to do and you might as well do it

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,620
while she's in front of you so what do

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,770
you need to know about the way that

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,830
you're changing your can privacy machine

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:55,380
- well we all know TV probes yesterday

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,200
it replaced the general data of the news

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,470
there's that affection to effective of

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,600
1995 which was incorporated in the UK in

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,920
the Data Protection Act 1998 so when

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,560
people said divert that correct that's

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,720
what we need that is now been superseded

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,150
by the data protection bill which

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,340
received Royal Assent I believe on

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,330
Wednesdays that they left it till a few

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:23,430
days obviously they went smarter by the

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,650
way I do slides so beautiful maintains

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,620
the original principles of what we've

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,060
always had since 1995 just expands them

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,750
and modernizes them for the ways we

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,250
collect the process and you status today

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,380
GDP our deals with what we might call

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,880
data at rest your collection your usage

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,580
you retain even what you do with it

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,320
inside your business what a lot of

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,120
people don't realize is that GDP dollars

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,010
on behalf of the European privacy

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,769
framework the other half is something

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,100
known as a privacy directive this was

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,260
supposed to go live yesterday in a sort

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,360
of double helix to keep yeah but it is

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,430
still bogged down in European committees

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
and I believe they've basically been

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,329
told for God's sake you need to finish

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,299
this up already because it's just it's

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:09,299
getting ridiculous the latest draft only

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,459
came out last week and it's eighty four

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,140
pages home and I mean I'm struggling to

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,280
read it it is getting to the point where

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,570
it is literally unintelligible so

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,100
product seed deals with that it what we

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,190
might call transit which is cookies

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,740
telemetry advertising beacons marketing

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,900
and yes analytics EPD is what you knows

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,220
the cookie ball which was a bit of a

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,550
misnomer because that was only part of

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,260
it

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:37,110
so they're saying perhaps linked autumn

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,180
early winter which in fact the penalty

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,010
winter early spring so we're going to

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,420
have a slightly awkward here where we

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,030
have a new data protection framework

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,530
locating to that arrest and an older

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,820
protection framework pertaining to data

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,470
in transit and the thing to know about

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,960
that is that line of these specifically

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,530
mentioned the words analytics it's more

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,510
about the concepts so you don't have to

00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,970
keep up with what's happening BPD among

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,670
your as best you can so what I will say

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,620
is that this talk is really about what

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,950
you need to do for the next year it's

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,180
going to be updated in a year or so I

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,830
need to run over a couple of definitions

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,390
with you I don't need you to memorize

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,240
this but you do have to know what we're

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,490
talking about so European data

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,980
protection law pertains to personal data

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,740
this is any information relating to an

00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,780
identified or an identifiable natural

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,210
person this could be one piece of

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,570
information or multiple data points

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:33,000
combined in a record now as I say gdpr

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,370
modernize these things so new

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,620
definitions of personal data are the GPR

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,190
includes genetic data biometric data

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,620
location data and online identifiers so

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,490
your honor lytx data becomes personal

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,500
data the current personal data is very

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,120
different from an American term you

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,990
might have heard called PII personally

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,200
identifiable information PII is a

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,180
specific set of data identifiers us it's

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,700
a really odd list like name address

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,210
birthplace it's mere things like I think

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,910
your license plate number and as well as

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,370
a couple of things which could be PII in

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,590
context such as age gender salary data

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,260
but you need to be where it's a it's a

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,450
limited data set but when we're getting

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,270
into our Google ethics Analytics

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,840
configuration it talks about PII so I

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,250
want you to be aware what Google right

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,990
your team's out of section or softened

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,840
up which is why you really need to

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,250
double-check these things other thing

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,169
you need to be aware of is what's called

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,880
sensitive personal data which is

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,550
information about racial or ethnic

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,620
origin political opinions religious or

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,720
philosophical beliefs trade union

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,180
membership health data sex life or

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,009
sexual orientation or past or stant

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,130
criminal convictions and remember this

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:52,729
is all it's all about context so if you

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:57,990
have analytics data about individuals

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:59,880
browsing about sexual health issues it's

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:05,699
all sensitive personal data aggregated

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:08,340
together under European data privacy law

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,259
this too is two sets of people one is

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,050
the data controller so that's the person

00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,180
or the entity that means you really or

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,370
your business who decides what data

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,530
processed how you use it and who you

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,180
share what process just means used so

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,430
the analytics data you're looking at

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,400
your being a data controller about that

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,740
but the data processor is any person

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,750
other than the employee of other

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,060
employer of the data controller who

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,979
processes the data on behalf of the data

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,539
controller that's seem confusing

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,349
hold that thought it will make sense in

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,349
a minute under GDP are the rights we

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,240
have always had over our data have been

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:47,310
strengthened and reinforced the ones

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,889
that pertain to analytics are the right

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,289
to be informed the right to restrict

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:54,360
processing the right to object and

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,880
certain rights related to profiling

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,680
we're talking about very innocuous uses

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,020
of analytics but the hard stories you

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,509
see I mean Cambridge analytical is just

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,729
the Nexus of all horror stories about

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:08,639
data about web browsing and purchasing

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:11,610
habits being aggregated with offline

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,440
data so that's called profiling but on

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,000
an everyday basis for youth analytics

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,490
this means telling your site visitors

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,319
what you're doing with analytics in your

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,449
privacy notices as well as what you're

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,630
doing with them if you're aggregating it

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:27,010
with anything else selling it or easy

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,260
disclose the cookies you use if the

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,270
analytics use cookies give them

00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,330
information on how to opt out of being

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,960
trapped forever UNIX and remove any

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,810
Analytics request methods you're craving

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:44,850
elaborated upon request and this slide

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:47,530
has changed since we started this so

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,360
bring it all together Jake through level

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,430
looks and gdpr who's them you're the

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,640
data controller so you are responsible

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,050
protecting your users data including

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,150
your analytics records and any

00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,770
information you aggregated with them

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,000
when you're logging in when you're

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,580
looking at them when you're studying

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,220
them you still have to safeguard all

00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,990
those people's data in full compliance

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,390
with the law and their rights in there

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,060
right so forth but Google Analytics is

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,980
the data processor so they're the data

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,710
processor looks like that the fighters

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,710
IP address or addresses device

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,540
identifier and client identifiers now if

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,700
you use it here in Europe you'll have

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,680
probably seen a pop up there would be a

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,110
pop up and an email to sign your new

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,030
data processing agreement if I'm doing

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,500
this to cover their legal backside so

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,230
they can say this is what we've agreed

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,120
to so you now have to give them your

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,670
contact information if there's a privacy

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,410
concern as your data protection officer

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,510
if applicable remember not everyone

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,480
needs a data protection officer but if

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:49,120
you do they want to know who that is

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,310
so that you haven't found that so this

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,530
is what Google Analytics admin screen

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,080
looks like I always talk about the three

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,270
columns so that first thing is in the

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,880
account settings in that first column if

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,890
you haven't already accepted the

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,600
agreement that's where you could find it

00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,470
isn't that first column create account

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,480
account settings and that will cover all

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,100
of your properties that you may manage

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,710
in Google Analytics not the account

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:20,260
level I mean you have to it's long you

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,510
would review the amendment and then you

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:28,910
would just manage your DPA details if

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:30,620
that were necessary and that's it so

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,079
obviously the real hot-button issue

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,220
about gdpr has been the notion of

00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:40,220
consent this gets into a really big

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,440
debate about who do you need consent to

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,420
track down oolitic because in the act of

00:10:42,440 --> 00:11:05,980
asking for consent you're losing the

00:10:44,420 --> 00:11:09,170
count so you take it from a sort of

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:21,529
triangle with you about your ready

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:23,360
complying with service so what the terms

00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:25,370
of in the terms of service just don't

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,399
let you collect anything in any

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,230
combination that is personally identify

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,329
it and that personally identifiable

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,569
information and I'm going to I think my

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,819
next one of the examples I have is a lot

00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,800
of times you'll see post forms that have

00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:41,389
email you know you have a big URL and

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,019
then it says an email equals Marissa

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:47,149
goldsmith at Marissa Goldsmith com that

00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:48,709
then gets sent into Google Analytics and

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,630
now I actually know the email address of

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,100
the person who I'm truck who who looked

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,589
at that page so that is personally

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,170
identifiable information you have the

00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,730
ability to make custom dimensions where

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,040
if I'm filling out a form and I say I

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,790
have hazel eyes and I track that piece

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,519
of information

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,139
suddenly you now know I have hazel eyes

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,790
and then you could combine that with I

00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,149
also happen to live in West Springfield

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,170
Virginia in the United States and

00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:13,699
suddenly you start making all that

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,199
information together and that is all

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:23,420
considered personally identifiable

00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:25,709
information so all the production that

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,999
you're not doing that

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,740
we're also going to assume you're

00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:31,290
compliant with the existing cookie law

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,879
which in the UK includes some variations

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,550
which the Information Commissioner's

00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,899
Office office put in I'm you're also

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,730
going to do everything which is going to

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,439
explain to you shortly in your settings

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,300
we're also going to assume you've

00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:44,999
disclosed everything they're doing with

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,459
analytics in your privacy notice on that

00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:51,059
basis you could say that active consent

00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:53,249
is not required but Betty might take the

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,529
ideological view that I do that yes

00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:57,029
maybe you're only using Google Analytics

00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,949
to see who's looking at your website

00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:00,720
what pages they're looking at you're not

00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:01,800
doing anything with that data I mean how

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,019
many of us have had meetings with

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,189
clients where we said okay what if your

00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,679
analytics say and they say you're not

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:09,480
looking at it okay fair enough but

00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,089
Google's still collecting that data and

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,559
then it's the own question of what is

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,619
Google doing with that data because

00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,720
there's a reason it's free good product

00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:19,829
they're collecting data on you we don't

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,449
know what they're doing and we've

00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:23,939
watched a lot of very entertaining and

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:25,949
congressional hearings for every billion

00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:28,290
about what actually happens with this

00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:31,079
data that you've been giving them on

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,629
that basis you might want to say that

00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:37,410
yes it is required to get people's

00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:39,600
active consent anything like and I think

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,179
we're both right but what's the best

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,179
thing to do here we feel there's a

00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,679
middle ground what you thing is that

00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,179
privacy by the design fundamentals which

00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,910
I've spoken about before that's part of

00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,230
you to go and they say that you collect

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,420
as little does required

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,160
retain it for several times required

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,459
undelete it when it's no longer needed

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,589
so you can take steps as part of a

00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:03,899
healthy privacy framework not necessary

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,670
because you but there's things that you

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,420
could do to not collect data in the

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,860
first place

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,410
so they're Google doesn't collect that

00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,329
data in the first place privacy by

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,629
design also has a rule against is you

00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:17,699
have some scenarios I saw a privacy

00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:19,559
person tweeting that she will deliver

00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:21,059
the blog post and she wishes she knows

00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,040
she knows who was reading it because she

00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,809
doesn't have analytics and I felt like

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,790
you're ignoring the privacy by design

00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:29,220
principle gets you know some scenarios

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,559
there is a little ground you can collect

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,380
the bare minimum useful analytics you

00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,020
need

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,610
to know what the heck your blog is doing

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,920
on your site and still respect the user

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,930
privacy inside functionality we're also

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,730
aware that you're here today not because

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,740
you want to join a crusader filter

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,140
window you just need to know practically

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:53,710
what to do so that's we're going to do

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:55,870
we're gonna run through how we're gonna

00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,370
tell you what to cover in the privacy

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,420
notices you need to have on your site

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,250
anyway we're going to look ahead to what

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,100
I could stretch out of that latest 84

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:09,070
page draft without my eyes falling down

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,170
about what might change in future for

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,350
analytics and consent but here's what

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:22,930
you need to do the technical bit so if

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:24,400
you're into your and if you're not and

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,380
you catch me later and more than happy

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,890
to help anyone with anything they need

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,020
or answer any questions so I'm gonna

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,970
have some examples here that I put up I

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,550
use Google tag manager with all my

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,830
google analytics so the examples that I

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,440
have will use Google tag manager and

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,000
that is just a tag manager it's a user

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,160
interface that makes putting Google

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,840
Analytics stuff on your website a little

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,550
bit easier you can also view these

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,690
things straight in the code and in the

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:55,270
code snippets we're going to start first

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,400
with IP addresses IP addresses certainly

00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:00,100
fall under the personal data of gdpr

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,930
and so Google Analytics actually does

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,800
have a parameter that's called anonymize

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:07,240
IP and I'm advising everyone right now

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,970
to set it to true

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,430
you said anonymize IP to true the

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,930
consequence of doing this is someone

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,400
actually did a real study on this idea

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,980
to study this I'm leading someone else's

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,720
study some of the geolocation data that

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,300
isn't in Google Analytics may lose its

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,130
accuracy IP address is just one of the

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,910
many things that Google Analytics uses

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:30,280
to tell where you're coming from and one

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:33,280
thing that I always used to do with my

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,170
clients was exclude your own offices IP

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,030
address from your Google Analytics

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,970
account because you're not do want your

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:42,030
internal you know you're browsing

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,170
showing up in your Google Analytics

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,610
you're not going to be able to do that

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,860
anymore because the IP

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,420
is no longer being registered in that

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,970
case there are some really great chrome

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,790
plugins and Safari plugins help block my

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,279
analytics you put it in you press a

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,839
button and then the analytics doesn't

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:04,990
get tracked from your machine from your

00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:08,350
computer so if you are using Google tag

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,730
manager there's the more setting if you

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,220
scroll down and your Google Analytics

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:15,790
page view tab there's more Settings feel

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,160
to set you just say anonymize IP true

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:21,010
and let that go so that's in Google tag

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,660
manager if you go and you go to the

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,459
Google documentation and look for an

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,470
autumn eyes IP if you're doing step

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,209
straight in the code it should be there

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,799
as well

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,540
many of the WordPress plugins that you

00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,549
might use for Google Analytics on your

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,320
site will also have a checkbox to allow

00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:40,299
you to anonymize the IP and they'll do

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:43,419
it for you this is the example I was

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:46,570
talking about before in the page path

00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:49,630
let's say I enter my email address into

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,700
a newsletter signup form this is

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,990
sometimes that Thank You page something

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,360
that would say like there's my email

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,000
address right there in plain text if

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,660
you've ever looked at a page path report

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,549
in Google Analytics that'll show up and

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,010
they it's bad for analytics in about a

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,360
million ways but it's also really bad to

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,100
be compliant in gdpr

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,660
so this generally happens when you use a

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,270
get instead of a post in your form

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,130
submissions and you are already

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,710
violating Google Analytics Terms of

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,660
Service if you do that you can do its

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,280
with email I've seen a client who had

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,290
this whole form filled out to see if

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,049
people fall off' ID for a subsidy and

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:28,870
then included their email address their

00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:31,179
actual address and their income range

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:35,440
that is really really really really bad

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:41,720
to have in a URL Google Analytics use it

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:44,190
or not so don't do that okay

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,170
so this is an example of what can happen

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,360
if you're putting email addresses in the

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,860
URLs to pull up page information and

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,600
data here's an example of someone who

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,250
put in someone else's email address and

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,990
it brought in someone else's preferences

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,510
you can put in anyone's email address

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:01,310
you know so be really careful with using

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,310
that kind of information in a URL so

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:07,080
whatever you can do just try to avoid

00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,060
having that information in a URL check

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,730
your plug forms and plugins seeing

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,460
making sure that they use in post for

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,130
some reason if you must programmatically

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,350
remove this information it has to be

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,960
removed before it hits Google Analytics

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:26,130
when you get this there's a good post by

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,170
Samaha who writes a little script on how

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:31,230
to redact to that information in the URL

00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:33,060
before it hits Google Analytics if you

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,490
do really like Google Analytics and

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,740
especially like Google tag manager his

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:41,790
blog is about the best thing in the

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:45,570
world to read and in the Google

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:48,920
Analytics configuration there is the

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:51,480
ability to exclude and filter parameters

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,330
in this case that's not good enough

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,710
because the data is still hitting Google

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,240
Analytics and then you're you're

00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,640
processing it afterwards

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,320
you want to get that stuff out before it

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,360
even hits Google Analytics you don't

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,710
even want to send it to them at all all

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,500
right so we're gonna review a bunch of

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,390
configurations that will cause Google

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,180
Analytics to collect more data than you

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,640
want and unless you either get consent

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,100
or know as much about gdpr as Heather

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,020
does and think you're not doing anything

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,670
wrong just turn them off and we're going

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:29,520
to go through a bunch of things that you

00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:31,800
should turn off advertising features you

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,200
can and and google has explicitly stated

00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,390
this you cannot turn on advertising

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,550
features unless you get consent okay and

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,400
part of advertising feature at the

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,540
advertising features includes the

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,730
demographics and interest reports in

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,930
Google Analytics when those first showed

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,450
up like two or three years ago and

00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,590
everyone wanted those turned on everyone

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,059
was so excited I'll tell you

00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:59,830
I think the data is not really useful

00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:01,659
it's very large buckets I read one study

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,460
that said it's pretty inaccurate also

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,919
it's not really that great to begin with

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,260
and since it requires consent and I've

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,919
yet to use it in any act for any active

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,570
client I just turn it off but by default

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,830
a lot of people are very encouraged to

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,529
see that and they just turn it right on

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:22,659
so leave that off tracking info data

00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,970
collection there's remarketing and

00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:26,679
advertising report features if you're

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,240
going to use remarketing you have to get

00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,360
active consent if you're not using

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,690
remarketing and don't turn it on just

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:40,510
don't turn it on at all and get consent

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:42,659
if you are doing remarketing so here's

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:46,750
where these are remarketing off

00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:52,090
advertising reporting features off off

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:54,190
is always the best this is something

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,630
that's new I want to talk about a little

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,100
bit if you have Google Analytics you

00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,659
probably got an email if you've logged

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,980
into your Google Analytics you saw you

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:04,360
saw this huge ugly yellow banner that

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,770
said that Google has added a new

00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,990
configuration for data retention in the

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,059
state's everyone freaked out about this

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,500
I was getting emails from crying food

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,799
they're gonna erase my data what should

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,840
I do they're gonna release my data look

00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:22,510
for DDP are you do not retain data for

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,390
longer than necessary you can adjust the

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,850
retention schedule by default Google is

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,820
setting it to 26 months you can set it

00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:33,580
to never if you're if you are in my camp

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,500
that you are only tracking pseudonymous

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,080
data that is just about your website and

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,929
you're not tracking any personal data

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,700
visit do not expire option but I

00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:46,059
actually think twenty six months is good

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,130
number one for a why of the Google Terms

00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:49,899
of Service only guaranteed good data for

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,600
that long if you wanted to do more than

00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:55,659
two years of tracking you really

00:22:52,600 --> 00:23:00,429
couldn't trust what came before number

00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:02,770
two I will buy a pint for anyone who has

00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:05,160
ever had to look at more than three

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:11,580
years of data

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:16,260
at one time all of it together wait wait

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:19,050
I'm not done yet but it doesn't affect

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,460
the standard aggregate reporting so if

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,340
you're looking at standard aggregate

00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,630
reporting you're still okay I did that

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,010
backwards I should've said buying the

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:30,720
pint after the standard aggregate

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:33,630
reporting what it really affects is if

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,030
you do a lot of events tracking if you

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,480
do a lot of custom dimensions you might

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:41,730
lose those and you lose the ability to

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,130
do the really advanced stuff in the

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:47,700
advanced segments or secondary

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:50,130
dimensions or if you use the Google

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,960
Analytics plug-in for Google sheets some

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,330
of those things might get lost if you

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,390
really need to do that you should take a

00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:00,150
look at what you're collecting make sure

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,620
it's not again personal data you can

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,790
either check you and then you can change

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:08,070
your retention settings so this is my

00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:10,740
this is my ranch from yesterday the sky

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,750
is not falling Google is not erasing

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:20,430
everything you didn't even really have a

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:21,990
right to it anyway so this is what that

00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,400
looks like there and then there's

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,840
another thing here that's we said on new

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:36,360
activity so if someone came back they're

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:38,700
26 months would start over okay here's

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,580
some more configuration pieces tracking

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,760
info user ID does anyone use the user ID

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,940
feature for Google Analytics at all and

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,950
turn it right off what this does is if

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,790
you have a site that relies on logins

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,170
let's say I have an app on the phone a

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,490
website and then I know someone uses it

00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,070
at work and at home and in three

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:02,370
different places it allows you to stitch

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:05,010
the user together whereas if I used

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,300
Google if I use your website here and

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,220
then I went home on a different computer

00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,190
and use it on a different computer I'm

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,020
considered two users but if you have a

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,630
login system where you have a user ID

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,240
that can connect users together it can

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,710
stitch those users together Muni

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,350
active consent if you want to be doing

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:26,660
something like that since no one is

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:29,940
doing it just turn it right off it is

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,720
off when this came out several years ago

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,870
I thought it was going to be the

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,150
greatest thing since sliced bread but um

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:39,590
very very few organizations really have

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,590
a need for it it'll really have used it

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,290
okay next is on product linking there's

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:48,000
if you go into that second column you

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,230
can link your AdWords your Adsense

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,580
there's like a million products I

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,150
haven't even really thought about or

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,240
heard of

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,740
if you don't actively use those products

00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,679
don't link them up you know if you had

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,450
used AdWords once two years ago and

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,620
don't really look at it anymore you can

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:06,150
unlink it in that second column we also

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,750
talked about how you might sometimes see

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:11,940
post backs never used it don't use them

00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,380
audience definitions audience

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,240
definitions go hand-in-hand with

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,640
remarketing

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,320
so again if you're doing remarketing you

00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,640
need to get consent if you're not doing

00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,540
remarketing don't create these

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,700
definitions custom definitions we'll

00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,590
talk about in a minute has anyone used

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,650
the data import in Google Analytics

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:34,110
before this is again where you need to

00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:37,500
be careful you can import some cost data

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:41,390
into Google Analytics just don't import

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,390
data that would be personal information

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,230
all right so these are custom dimensions

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,120
and events isn't it these are a little

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,580
bit more common to use does anyone make

00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,380
event use events in Google Analytics

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,140
downloads to PDFs outbound links that's

00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,940
pretty common usage you can do a lot

00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,590
more advanced things with that and with

00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,880
custom dimensions and events this is

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,590
where Google really wants you to be

00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,080
careful because they're the ones with

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,550
the power were the ones defining what

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,770
goes into an event or what goes into a

00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,980
custom dimension so when you're doing

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,929
this kind of tracking I like to use

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,420
custom dimensions to describe content

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:17,429
one of the things I do in WordPress

00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,010
specifically is I make a custom

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:22,470
dimension for author I'll make a custom

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,570
dimension for content category so I can

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,419
make reports that are instead of like

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:30,960
the 300 pages that I have and the page

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:33,030
views Google Analytics topic

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,740
these are the pageviews you know GDP our

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,030
topic these are the pageviews and so

00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,290
that's one of the ways that I like to

00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,060
use custom dimensions and I actually

00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,610
think it's the best way and when you're

00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,320
using custom dimensions that way no

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,610
personal information you're just

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,670
recording what's happening with the

00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,380
content some people sometimes will use

00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:54,270
custom dimensions if let's say a user

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:56,460
logs in I have a website a user logs

00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,620
into my website I can create a user

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,690
scoped custom dimension so if that

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,120
person comes back to my website even if

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:06,060
they don't log in I know that they've

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,440
logged in once before and that's where

00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,790
you need to be careful when you start

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,380
making your custom dimensions that you

00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:14,400
keep you in autumn eyes everything as

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,230
much as possible I've seen events where

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,560
people track the zip codes and the

00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,060
postal codes that people put into a form

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,660
high colors the example that I use the

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,920
income you should not usually really try

00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,110
to avoid putting any of those things in

00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,510
Google Analytics again not even for gdpr

00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,770
but for Google Analytics Terms of

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:36,000
Service and for just being a good

00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:38,700
citizen and you need to make sure that

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,530
there is no combination of this data so

00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,080
let's say I only put an eye color it's

00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:45,120
not that big a deal there's only a few

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,700
of them and I have thousands of visitors

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,020
I'll never be able to point anyone else

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,840
but then somewhere else I'm tracking zip

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,250
code then I can see in one session that

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,030
there is Marissa coat that there is

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,700
someone there

00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:00,150
with hazel eyes who lives in the postal

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,130
code two two one five two I live in a

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,080
small postal code area you might

00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:08,910
actually be able to find me and identify

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,860
me and all of these things if you've set

00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:14,220
your retention policy properly if you

00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:17,880
don't it will expire anyway it goes in

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,530
with each other so these are what event

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,120
so these are events that I have made in

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,220
the past that I think are pretty good

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,780
I'd like to trap navigation for the UX

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,690
purposes I like to track exactly how

00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,070
people click on navigation so I can see

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:34,980
if there are improvements I can make to

00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:37,140
navigation that's okay now this is again

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,970
depending on whose side you fall on my

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,640
side or Heather side dealing with the

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:44,910
cookie IDs if you really think that

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,950
using a cookie with an ID

00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:50,490
is non-compliant and you want to get rid

00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:53,460
of it what you can do is make the cookie

00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,960
expire after the session closes in that

00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,490
case you're not really tracking an

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,440
individual that individual has no eye

00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,560
cookie ID associated with them because

00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,060
it's gone there's a website here from

00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,940
humans that have a good article on how

00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,950
to do this with Google tag manager how

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,860
to track various levels of consent that

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:13,620
have been given a bit of JavaScript in

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,660
it they use Google tag manager but the

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,360
script will work outside of it it

00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,160
shouldn't be a problem if you do this

00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,040
the consequence is is you pretty much

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,740
have no return visitor metrics which to

00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,300
me is pretty important that's why that's

00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,590
why I'm falling I'm not excited and not

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:33,780
either side that's the thing I care a

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:37,080
lot about and so here's an example of a

00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:45,060
tag that has various levels of various

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:48,180
levels of consent I like I said I use

00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,040
Google tag manager you do need to

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,780
consider again that it is a Google tool

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,100
you're putting a Google tag on your site

00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,700
and you need to think about what Google

00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,850
does with it Google tag manager can also

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,470
be used for other things it's not just

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,790
the way to implement Google Analytics

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:07,500
it's a way to implement all your

00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:09,450
marketing tags and so I would take this

00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,240
opportunity if you do use Google tag

00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,590
manager to go through and see the things

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,270
that you might be think you might need

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,340
consent for if you have a Facebook pixel

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,830
sitting in Google tag manager you might

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,710
need consent for that and I would start

00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,570
doing a clean out of deleting the ones

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,730
you don't know you need you don't think

00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:29,190
you need it versions if it turns out you

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,140
need it back you can get it back but

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,820
clean up your Google tag manager if you

00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,520
have a lot of things in there it'll feel

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,940
good to have a nice small manageable

00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,680
list of tags and then you should also

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,690
start thinking about putting together a

00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,260
governance process for getting those

00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:47,640
tags in there

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:50,400
the other thing is this deletion API

00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:54,150
this literally we people have been

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,500
talking about it for a long time but I

00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,460
was over the ocean when they actually

00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,960
released it to get here so

00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,450
don't know much more about it except for

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,190
that it exists and it allows you to

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,450
delete data based on the Google

00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:10,150
Analytics client ID it looks promising

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,920
as a Google Analytics engineer I've been

00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,600
dying to be able to delete data out of

00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,540
Google Analytics for a really long time

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,100
gdpr or not you know you have dev

00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,380
environments you have things that don't

00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,510
belong you accidentally double count

00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,010
things above the idea of being able to

00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,320
delete data out of it

00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:28,690
and it took a European law to make that

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:48,490
happen but I don't know how it's going

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:53,590
to work so any privacy notice on your

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:56,200
website what analytics you're using what

00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,240
you're collecting why you collected who

00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,770
has access to it that's your governance

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,440
process that's really an internal thing

00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,910
how you audit it again when was the last

00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,470
time you actually looked through this

00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:07,600
stuff what you're collecting why are we

00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:10,180
collecting it whether it's used for

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,720
profiling for advertising anything like

00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,720
that

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,420
what if any cookies are used and how a

00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,720
user can opt out whether that's through

00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:22,900
Google Analytics settings um a browser

00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,700
extension browser settings in order to

00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,130
make that privacy notice you can either

00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,530
use the work cut the pipes you notice

00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,540
tool in your oneplus dashboard which

00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,950
shipped with version four point nine

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,080
point six last week there's a nice

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,000
little tutorial that I wrote you don't

00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,830
have to use that you can use any privacy

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,580
notice page as long as it's not a

00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:44,040
template

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:47,860
remember in GPL or getting away from

00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:50,590
there's a well-known wordpress plugin

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,210
that had a privacy policy and I

00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,860
deliberately put a title in it to see

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,320
how many other people were copying and

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:59,140
pasting and putting it as is next done

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,880
you can't just download and copy in

00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,980
place boilerplate anything you have to

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,380
like your own types notice so what is

00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,750
the tool or something you already have

00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,149
just don't think

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,950
cut and pasted from anyone else I did do

00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,510
a talk about how to do it in London and

00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,179
I was hoping it would be on WordPress TV

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:19,409
by now but it's not but please watch it

00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:21,629
when it is up Google Analytics are not

00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:24,300
the only fruit so we thought it would be

00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:25,889
worthwhile talking about other analytics

00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,200
packages as well as soon that can

00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,000
capture data for example Twitter if you

00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:51,810
add this line of code you're pretty

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:54,899
header it will super metrics is a tool

00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:57,390
that is an aggregating tool works with

00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:58,770
the Google sheets plugin my advice is

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,480
not to go get it that's not what I'm

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,220
asking you to do but take a look at the

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,890
tool and take a look at all the things

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,260
that it could aggregate if you use any

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,820
of those things you're using and

00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,710
advertising it's essentially an

00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,920
advertising tool so you need to be

00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:15,510
careful about that um I have in the past

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,150
used super metrics to do things like

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,310
create combined dashboards of tweets

00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:23,580
with Google Analytics with a few other

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:25,230
things but it's a good repository of all

00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,300
the marketing tools in the whole wide

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:30,390
world that you might possibly be able to

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,119
use and there's an aggregate some

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,540
aggregators like a tool called brand

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,790
watch and they're sort of an interesting

00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,890
case because what brand watch does is

00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,260
say I'm a brand and I just want to see

00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:45,750
what's happening on Facebook and on

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,000
Twitter and on a few other and Instagram

00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,490
it brings and aggregates all that data

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,990
together it's theater that's out there

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,720
and it's in the public but it's also

00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,400
other people's personal information

00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,720
sitting in one aggregator and so you do

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,589
need to be a little bit careful about

00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,720
how you use tools like that again

00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:04,859
governance access making sure what what

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,359
are the things that I'll always say is

00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:08,040
making sure that if you have let someone

00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,690
go if someone has quit or if you have

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,660
fired them that you change your

00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:14,160
passwords get rid of their account I

00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,390
brought up the brand watch example

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,790
because I had a client who had gotten

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,800
rid of someone six months ago and their

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,720
email address was still the account on

00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,870
watch and I don't know if anyone changed

00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,550
the address anything like that so

00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:31,940
there's other analytics packages you can

00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:35,880
use pivot has changed its name tomato

00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:39,330
design 5c and mine but you had some

00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,160
interesting it's not interesting my

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,220
interesting thought is that I would I

00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,380
would be super happy if I'm gonna always

00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,590
called it pillock but if my Tomo became

00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:52,680
like the analytics package of choice but

00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:54,630
it just it isn't if you need to hire

00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,100
someone to do your analytics for you the

00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,010
chances of them knowing the tool are

00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,810
gonna be very slim they do have an

00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,270
installed version which is very nice but

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:05,010
then you are now responsible for the

00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,410
privacy of everything including your

00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,660
servers so there are some issues with

00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,030
that as well I've personally been using

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,860
an Irish service called step counter

00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:16,560
since before there was glue analytics

00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,900
you can excuse to not set cookies and

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,550
obscure the IP address so I just I just

00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,350
want to know what posts are popular and

00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,450
that's really good for me same with

00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,580
jetpack stats it collects very little

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,760
information just basically tells you

00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:32,430
what pages are popular and the cookie

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,050
set is admin only so if all you're

00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,450
wanting to do is know who's reading but

00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:40,530
just what's being read just stick with

00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:42,960
jetpack leave one or two touches on the

00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:48,860
dangers of aggregating analytics data

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,860
with other forms of tracking so winner

00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:55,650
say that after guinness when you can

00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,680
take lots of data points and stitch them

00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:01,830
together so we already know you can't do

00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:05,010
this officially but you can do it with

00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,750
other tools um there was i saw a video

00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,220
of a talk where if somebody was talking

00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:11,570
about putting google analytics hot

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:14,670
jarring facebook pixels and i was like

00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:17,490
because that is capturing all sorts of

00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:20,010
pieces of data about an individual site

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:24,480
visitor which can be stitched together

00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:26,160
to the james bond levels of monitoring

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,120
and tracking so as he said with your

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,070
example

00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,720
if you go into your e-commerce tool and

00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,180
see that where's the Goldsmith from what

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,800
Springfield ordered something 833 you

00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,080
can then go into Google Analytics to

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,480
track the patterns and you know that

00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,180
that's who she is and then you can match

00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,230
it up with the hot dog you were taking

00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,880
of what she was let's see we got this

00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,210
poor woman under surveillance

00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,220
so set really strict organizational

00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:56,790
rules about cross-referencing data

00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,770
sources or don't track it to the inland

00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:00,480
eye width as with everything I would

00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:03,570
recommend burning your Facebook pixels

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,050
in a fire but I know that that's not an

00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:11,100
option

00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:12,750
oh I mean one of the things I have

00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,760
always tried to be a people-pleaser and

00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,520
I'm also you know I work with clients

00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,100
and so someone comes to me and says we

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,070
got a pixel you got to put it up they

00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,750
give me the code I go and I put it up

00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,190
but more and more I kept doing this the

00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,500
more and more I kept realizing that I

00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,030
was putting things up that were maybe

00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,850
will use this data in a few years this

00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,840
is just in case data or this is

00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,550
something that will get so much

00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,280
information about our users and then you

00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:41,160
want to take a step back because the

00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,690
more stuff you collect just in case the

00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,000
more tempted someone's gonna be to

00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,410
stitch that together so the if you

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,200
really don't need it and if it's not

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,640
really useful don't do it because down

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,280
the road someone might ask you to do

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,870
something evil with it don't put it on

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,760
your site just because someone tells you

00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,470
to what you want to do is you want to

00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,960
develop a real governance process around

00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:02,870
these things a lot of people equate

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,370
governance processes with bottlenecks

00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:06,750
but it doesn't have to be that way but

00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,450
there does have to be a gatekeeper of

00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,980
sorts who says you know what you don't

00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,750
need this pixel this is just in case

00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,360
data and we're never gonna use it

00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,850
bye-bye extra just in case data usually

00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,100
messes things up anyway it makes data

00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,480
data collection data waiting a year from

00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,760
now much harder because you don't know

00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,680
why it was there and why you know you

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,150
can create create master at these

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,590
massive field maps conductor a privacy

00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,480
impact and talk to all your vendors

00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,490
about what they're doing to be compliant

00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,319
I've heard some really really lousy

00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,579
vendor --ax vendor

00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:40,650
the nation's about how they're going to

00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,119
be gdpr and compliant and I'm not really

00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:47,989
sure what to do with them and we don't

00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,989
use them so it comes to you a little

00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:59,579
trying to predict what's going to happen

00:40:55,259 --> 00:41:01,109
based on a draft is a fool's errand they

00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:02,999
are talking about how they acknowledge

00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:05,369
the analytics cookies can be useful for

00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:06,869
analytics processes but it's not the

00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:08,819
case however regarding cookies and

00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:11,180
similar identifier is used to determine

00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:16,259
the nature of you who is using the site

00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:19,109
they really are keen to see analytics as

00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:21,690
basic Fairburn statistical counting

00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,650
anything beyond that behavior basically

00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,349
anything to talk about

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:28,920
they're not so keen on that they want to

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:30,539
change the mechanism that looks best

00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,829
consent to browser settings so we're

00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:34,729
going to be able to get rid of all those

00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:37,079
cookie pop-ups dropdowns banners windows

00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:39,660
pretty much to do that already in the UK

00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:42,299
anyway but what they want you to be able

00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,729
to do is make those options really

00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:46,799
really granular and they don't want to

00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:48,989
dissuade end-users from selecting highly

00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:50,609
with higher privacy settings including a

00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:52,680
compilation of long term records of

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,150
individuals browsing histories and these

00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,059
are such records and targeted

00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,349
advertising I have a feeling based on

00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:01,499
what I've read they're going to move for

00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:04,289
an analytic setting in browsers and give

00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:07,049
it home universal google analytics is

00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:09,509
that might just be the you know the

00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:12,299
80/20 principle that would kill a lot of

00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:13,589
privacy concerns so give me a year to

00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:17,099
figure out what they were doing with it

00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:20,279
and I will let you know we have provided

00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:22,680
some links which will send the signs

00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:25,920
over what we want you to know the ICL

00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,619
has some fantastic resources on consent

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,529
and privacy if you come the Republic

00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,940
news data collection I II I will be

00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:34,640
talking about WordPress is gdpr

00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,619
compliance project and lightning

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,349
tomorrow I have separate side blog line

00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,569
where I monitor all these thorny

00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,769
technical human issues to Rex it

00:42:42,569 --> 00:42:49,459
Melissa's given a couple

00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:51,319
yeah he was on and I just I want to put

00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:54,109
it in there I caveat the optimized smart

00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:57,469
he uses a lot of what's the expression

00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:59,689
be the legitimate business news I don't

00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:02,150
agree with all his interpretations of

00:42:59,689 --> 00:43:03,890
legitimate interest but the tech is good

00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,269
like the the tech is good in that blog

00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,459
post and it's a really comprehensive

00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:10,249
list so it's worth looking at there's a

00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:13,400
humic blog post on ways to use Google

00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:15,529
tag manager to record varying levels of

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,130
consent and then fire tags or don't fire

00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:21,589
tags but depending on those the full

00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,049
Google privacy compliant site

00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:25,849
Brian Clifton blog post on Google

00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:27,169
Analytics in GDP or because I'd he's

00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:29,029
also a little bit more of a sky is

00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:32,269
falling kind of guy but it's again it's

00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:34,249
a good read and then the I added that

00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:45,979
this morning the GA deletion API

00:43:34,249 --> 00:43:48,979
