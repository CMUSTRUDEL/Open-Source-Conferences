Title: Tammie Lister: Building for Stress Cases
Publication date: 2019-05-08
Playlist: WordCamp Belfast 2018
Description: 
	We use the term edge cases, it’s time to stop using that and switch to saying stress cases.
It’s time to stop dismissing and make sure those stress cases are exactly what we do focus on creating the experiences for.
By building for the stress cases, we create a better experience for everyone.

thank you

00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,379
ceremony allows a little amazing

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,549
instruction today I'm no Kentucky Mike

00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:18,990
Bloomberg

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,910
building through the stress cases but

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,619
this kind of all feeds into a lot of the

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,279
work I do and then a lot of the feelings

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,489
that I kind of want to deal with in the

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:37,379
experiences that I design we all too

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:40,410
often say edge case but that's kind of

00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:44,969
dismissive that leads us reinforce Ain

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:49,650
yeah it doesn't matter it's just an edge

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,750
case and stress is bad we nobody wants

00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,500
to be in a situation of stress in that

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,690
situation of Pallett annuity was to

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,470
cause anyone else to have that same

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,949
feeling and what I'd like to talk about

00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:07,200
today is how we can avoid that I'd like

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,329
to be clear from the start I don't think

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,820
that anyone has the intention of causing

00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,759
someone stress or causing that within

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,310
the experience it's often this blinkered

00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,679
bubble of creating products that leads

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,299
us there and I really feel that that

00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:27,319
needs to change we also don't want to

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:31,200
think about how we create stress

00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:33,359
naturally the human nature is to feel

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,840
content and happy we don't want to dwell

00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,060
on these things but we have to the world

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,399
as much as I don't want to have every

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,490
Sunday morning the world isn't all

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,749
sparkles and Happiness all the time and

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,709
we have to be honest with ourselves

00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:51,599
about the experience that we create and

00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:53,999
honesty is the best gift you can give

00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,749
someone when interacting with the

00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:59,429
experience that you create and let's

00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:02,969
take a look at some of the roots of

00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:05,310
stress and really then look at the

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:14,239
problems and some tips along the way of

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:14,239
how with me fix this you know this

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:25,499
when you're trying to connect and you

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:27,450
get loading loading loading you can feel

00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:30,209
it right like in this room you can feel

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,889
just seeing this tiny animation it's

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,629
very interesting searching for loading

00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:36,980
graphics and then getting them come up

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:41,909
and getting a whole wall of this feeling

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:44,669
that's a stress case performance is not

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:47,329
getting the experience you want you need

00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:50,219
at the point that you want you need this

00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:52,469
that same stress goes into any

00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:57,629
experience that doesn't mean that need

00:02:52,469 --> 00:03:00,469
it's a new gap that feeling another

00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:03,209
stress Clause is not using a desktop

00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,459
when something feels like his experience

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,519
designed exactly perfectly for someone

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,650
sat in front of a high powered desktop

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,799
and we all know that feeling right at

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,480
this big site squished into this tiny

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,269
little experience that you're trying to

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,489
do may be burdens don't work this is

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,470
actually a great link to find and more

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,349
resources but this graphic to me

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,319
describes exactly the experience I have

00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:33,840
a tiny space that means it can't even

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:37,169
interact with it we create all too often

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,290
for a bubble sparkling perfect

00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:42,449
illusionary world we don't do this we

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,049
don't assume that people will be

00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:48,239
interrupted during their activities but

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,090
that's more than normal case of things

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,579
people don't get to interact in this

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,469
perfect we don't design for the

00:03:53,579 --> 00:04:03,269
interruptions and we really should be

00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:04,739
time is a huge part of this if you had

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,379
to do something in a certain time that

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,769
creates a hurdle that enhances that

00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:13,500
feeling and magnifies it and that these

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,229
kind of experiences wet up inside and

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,909
leave you screaming because you're

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,719
having that experience you're not

00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:23,370
functioning you're not thinking need to

00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,190
remember those feelings we need to

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,880
remember what these graphics

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,250
to us and then we can use this as fuel

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,020
to stop creating experiences that cause

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:39,380
those types of stresses being unable to

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,330
use an experience also causes stress we

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,060
can't only shouldn't design for

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,070
ourselves all the time I use the phrase

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,680
of thinking outside our headspace and

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,300
that's incredibly true we exist inside

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,820
our body inside our own little bubble

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,630
worlds and we need to step outside of

00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:00,110
that this quote to me resonates so so

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,180
very much there are six point four

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:06,500
billion people who are temporarily

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,240
able-bodied we have to stop this kind of

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,490
difference thinking it was thinking that

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,650
someone is other and begin to realize

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,080
everybody deserves an equal experience

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,980
that works for them when they want it

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,020
and when they need it

00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:23,180
so when talking about stress cases often

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,550
people rightly think of accessibility

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,980
and performance alone and that's crucial

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,190
but I'd like to also think of some other

00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,800
situations and to dive into those today

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,930
and a lot of those are related so you

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,060
can't really separate things so much but

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,960
I'm just going to kind of do that a tiny

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,000
little bit here

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:47,210
what about overly cute messages a cute

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,460
publishing flow or something and kind of

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,840
like that celebrate something but you're

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,960
actually writing about a loved ones

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,880
passing is this really a good time to

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,230
see balloons and a celebration of good

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,240
job you wrote a post probably not right

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,070
yeah you posted something awesome when

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,900
you think of it in a context of not

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,430
celebrating or when if you think about

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,830
in the context of something that maybe

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:15,350
isn't awesome doesn't it feel so great

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:17,480
right Eric Meyer and this is the

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:21,290
originators I've shown the best quote of

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:24,320
this idea of thinking about building for

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,000
these stress cases he was faced with a

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,590
facebook year interview showing him a

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,490
smiling picture of his daughter who had

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,700
passed away that year it rightly felt

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,770
wrong this was unkind to remind him

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,770
so forcefully this is a

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,060
of not wording for the worst case the

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:48,120
stress case wasn't even on the radar and

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:50,700
I found this a few days ago Google has

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,160
to discover this day feature and it's

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,200
not opt-in it just showed me these

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,360
pictures of discover the day I mean this

00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,450
wasn't a bad day for me imagine if it

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,210
was the moment you go to your Google

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,490
page it's there on and it's showing you

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,830
those photos imagine this is something

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,990
you didn't want to be reminded of with

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,970
all this thinking and the automation and

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,170
and things just uploading to the cloud

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:18,180
this could easily happen in sort of a

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,250
life happens and we really need to

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,920
design as if life does happen to

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,410
everybody and not as if we live in a

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,780
utopian bubble where life never happens

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,900
and it's a story birkin everything is

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,360
amazing everything is lovely likes to be

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,940
celebrated in all levels but we should

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,150
experience life to all levels in the

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,400
designs we create this becomes more and

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,060
more important with AI and machine

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:49,610
learning we are trusting in machines

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,610
that we need to really teach humanity to

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:57,840
situational stress is also important

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,420
this beyond that mobile access issue and

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,300
but it also is kind of as well but in a

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,800
situation maybe you're rushed or maybe

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,260
you in a situation where you have an

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,850
extreme weather condition something that

00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,470
you know someone else hasn't necessarily

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,900
thought about because they have an

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:16,110
experience trip and what about Google

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,900
glasses well maybe for those that want

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,160
to use this is it's exciting a

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,140
situational stress can also be in how

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,440
something is used in a situation it's

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,880
used as well I love this quote no one

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,920
could understand how you would want to

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,980
have that thing on your face in the

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,420
normal way of social interaction but

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,130
when it's been created it might seem

00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,320
like a great idea someone probably said

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,200
yeah that's great we want this because

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,610
their situation is ok for it but nobody

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,640
really thought about someone walking

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,530
around with Google glasses on their face

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,370
into a room or into normal situations

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,080
and that people wouldn't want that

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,110
financial stress

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,209
again this is related but we need to be

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,800
respectful than our own lives in the

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:00,529
same place for the same access to

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,570
everything or the same situation it's

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:06,140
that experience getting outside of our

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:09,320
headspace and there are many many ways

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:14,089
that people experience differently and

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,920
that cause these stresses so there are

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,140
some stress cases I'm now going to look

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,730
at why we really want to do this and why

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:24,230
inclusive design is good business

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,060
because quite honestly it is this is

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,399
quite a long quote I'm going to read it

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,990
because I think it's important if our

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,110
goal is to expand our market size

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,750
probably called total addressable market

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,520
in business parlance as - meaning the

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,649
demographic range of your product or

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,930
services then the way to grow the town

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,750
is to incorporate diversity into the

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,670
content and product team just on a

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,380
foundational level it makes good

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,390
business sense if we're going to create

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,440
products for everybody we should be

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,850
having this diversity

00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,230
anyone here know about the oxide product

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:03,050
range okay so this is the example of

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,029
good business they made this product to

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,290
just be more accessible from the handles

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:10,579
I'd turns out it's better for everybody

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,200
it's not just better for people that

00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:14,600
needed to have it it's just better for

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,740
everybody and it's led to commercial

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,600
success this design is good business it

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,459
was something that just happens to work

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,829
better for a lot of people and this

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:27,290
quite often happens we have this more

00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:31,490
inclusive and you build for those stress

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,070
cases and you include everybody it's

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,709
quite by Rodgers to me really put some

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,690
context into why assumptions we make

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:42,200
about age are something we really need

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,990
to shift from we don't want people to

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,110
feel this way we don't want people to

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,270
presume or consider themselves

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,670
technology dunces that's just not what

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,399
we should be craving for presume

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,620
insolence capacity just based on not

00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,320
understanding that doesn't feel right

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:04,029
that feels like we can do a little bit

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,029
better than that when we create products

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,630
I'd like to share a story from Yvonne's

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,690
article that is really worth sharing

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,190
she writes then a few months ago her

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,430
boyfriend convinced her to you snapped

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,980
out they were taking goofy pictures but

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,990
the app wouldn't map her face they tried

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,980
a few things they changed her position a

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,350
change lighting nothing worked she began

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,690
to get that flush of heat and a feeling

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,459
in her stomach that she had experience

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,319
growing up in Texas where she had

00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:36,410
actually received negative messages

00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:39,319
about her dark skin she was 21 words

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:42,860
years later and in her words she was too

00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:46,819
bright for snapchat that's an experience

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,579
that didn't look at the stress cases it

00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:52,220
didn't look at outside that bubble it

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:56,930
didn't look at all that it is to be

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,819
human the stories of stress really

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,380
should be focal points and spread

00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:03,139
throughout everybody creating the

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,810
product they need to be cautionary tales

00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,730
and they need to be used as to warn of

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,610
those walks of creation and little

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,740
points but we need to be careful and I

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,870
want to just kind of add a note here we

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,699
shouldn't use them as fetishes we

00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,880
shouldn't hold them up we should be and

00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:22,160
not be sensitive to really how you tell

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,709
them there needs to be a compassion and

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,600
that word again respect for how you tell

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:31,430
these stories and those that you're

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:34,040
telling the story of sever again here

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,079
builds on this idea of crisis does not

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,380
have to be I've listed some pretty

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,569
strong cases first dress but crisis

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,269
cannot be something as small as someone

00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:50,449
rushing through the airport and we need

00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:52,610
to consider this so why do products fail

00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:54,170
well there's lots of reasons I mean

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,029
would be here a while trying to list all

00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,610
the reasons why products fail but in the

00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:01,480
context of stress cases I would like to

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,790
suggest a few reasons why this happens

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,730
the first of these is quite frankly

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,980
having no clue who you're creating for

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,630
how can you create something when you

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,059
have no idea who you're actually making

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,550
this for and it sounds simple to say

00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:19,670
that it sounds like Flippen I

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:23,810
but it's easily the biggest issue when I

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,870
say no I mean really no I have those

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:30,380
stories know that the stresses and

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:32,570
really have that solution for solving

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,209
that the product is doing so just create

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:39,380
something for the sake of creating

00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:41,870
credit for a solution it's phrased to me

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,140
is something that I'm being reminded of

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,660
and I absolutely adore this and that

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,480
take him up with what would his human do

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:53,089
we need to include humanity at every

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,790
step and become aware of everything that

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:58,730
you are doing awareness and respect it's

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,730
who words I want you to take away it's

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,769
really a great mantra to live through as

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,480
you read aloud she says pretend you're

00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,970
talking to a real person and ask

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,459
yourself what I say this to someone in

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,560
real life sometimes our writing makes us

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:16,730
sound stood here or colder than we'd

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,130
like one of my like top issues with

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,350
interfaces is the word submit because of

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,209
this because you would not say that to

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,270
another thing I mean I hope you would

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:29,149
not say that to another human being it's

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:31,520
about and we're talking about in design

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,160
a lot of conversational UI and it's

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:39,470
about disrespectful conversation you

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,959
like human conversation of UI nobody

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,029
needs any more products I hate to break

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:46,370
this to you created for a select few

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,920
that can create that's not needed in the

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,050
world there's far too much of it already

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,820
bubble thinking leads us to wrong

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,890
conclusions and if you create in

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,730
isolation how can you create for

00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:01,060
everyone this is what you get when you

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,800
search for started office in Google

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,520
looks pretty similar right I mean

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,130
they're probably okay this is not

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,810
outside a bubble this is what products

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:17,180
are created in and this is in isolation

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,250
we need to remove from that and moving

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,370
on from that we need to remove them the

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,459
same people creating because that's

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,410
incredibly important and this is tricky

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,220
I know this is another problem that is

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,769
solved straight away and just by saying

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,019
in itself but we nearly need to

00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:35,819
represent outside that bubble with those

00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,790
that have the access and the ability to

00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:43,019
make these products and have that

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:45,629
influence but maybe you can use tiny

00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:48,149
little bit with research that's really

00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:51,889
not doing that you need people involved

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:54,269
who are creating this actual product

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:58,889
this is what you get when you search the

00:15:54,269 --> 00:16:05,220
developer you scrolled a little bit

00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:07,889
actually got a woman and it's still

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,810
happening and it's changing and it's

00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:12,540
slowly changing but we need to be aware

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:15,269
of this when we are creating we need to

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,230
be aware of our privilege in being able

00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:18,230
to do what we do

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,810
having no clear feedback channels is the

00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:28,079
easiest thing you can solve in a product

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:30,980
and it's a big thing that I see all too

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,259
often as a problem it's that low hanging

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,829
listening fruit if people have feedback

00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:39,600
let them have a way of doing it if you

00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:42,389
don't have a clear feedback channel how

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,569
can someone tell you their experience in

00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:49,079
using the product how can you make that

00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:51,180
experience better for everybody it's

00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,980
like a closed door you're not engaging

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:57,389
you're not having a conversation with

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,040
the people that are interacting all too

00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,819
often the experience is left to the

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,269
designer

00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:05,309
it's Berenson I would argue very loudly

00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:07,699
and strongly it's everybody's

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,140
responsibility plain and simple

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,059
experience I hope we've got past it's

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,230
being seen as that pixel pushing the

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,000
Polish to do it there

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,829
the last bit maybe do a bit of research

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,169
a little bit at the beginning maybe they

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,610
may do some user testing at the end so

00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:23,309
if you could use abolitionist user

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:26,189
testing this is everyone's

00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:29,460
responsibility and all too often the

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:32,190
human contact and that testing and that

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,159
interactions and that research is left

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,950
to the designers and that's how we get

00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:40,679
these fast disconnected bubble creating

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,130
teams those that are making the product

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,850
onyx

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,429
so they can't take that into the product

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:50,280
and yes designers will often in the

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:53,710
small companies take the point of this

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,809
but including other roles is a baseline

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,780
here and should be something that is

00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:01,360
happening little by little that design

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:06,610
infusion spreads and it can rapidly

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,289
change a product's direction now a movie

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,520
on seven is a little bit of a hard point

00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:14,200
because having empathy is great and

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,990
doing exercises to go in it is really

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,450
admirable but when it's not turned into

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,030
action it's just theater you're just

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,250
doing it to check a box and that's when

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:27,789
it can even become a burden and a

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,409
negative force you shouldn't be doing a

00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:34,090
check box with your connecting and

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:37,419
you're learning about experience nobody

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,940
likes to go through empathy theater to

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:43,299
have their time wasted and that's both

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,890
sides people will know if they're not

00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:46,900
going to be listened to and the action

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,460
that's not really taken and people will

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,289
know if they're just doing this because

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,090
someone decided that they had to have

00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:55,390
empathy for people that were using their

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:58,240
product and it's medicine that people

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,909
don't want because of that be sure your

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,549
product also is ready to be tested that

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:05,230
word respect have respected all of them

00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:07,450
present something that obviously has

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,270
broken issues that people are going to

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,100
fall into because they're not going to

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:17,679
progress that way and they're not gonna

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:19,179
bear to give you good feedback I will

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,500
know a little bit of a warning of going

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:25,120
too far here there's her these three

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,159
levels and I think it's worth saying and

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,110
the first is not empathizing and this is

00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,600
where someone is not feeling unity with

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,490
the other or with someone that's not in

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,929
their head space I prefer headspace

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:39,480
Tovar and then you have empathizing

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:43,299
empathizing is when someone feels unity

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,280
with someone else and then we have over

00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:47,530
empathizing and this is almost a point

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,600
where you can't progress and you can't

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:53,230
do anything because all you're having is

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,600
feels it's kind of there's a difference

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,009
between empathy and sympathy

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,440
and you don't want to move into that

00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:01,590
sympathy kind of realm when someone

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,630
confuses themselves with that person

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,480
their lives they take on all the feels

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,090
too much they just really can't be

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,850
productive then you've had this balance

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,159
of empathy and really had that that

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:18,840
sensitivity to know when something's

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:21,450
going to father the burden of usability

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,100
testing and stress case exposure can

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,870
often be felt in the place he wanted

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,600
least burden and that's where we have

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,490
empathy pain and this is a big problem

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,889
that can be seen particularly when a

00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,220
company or product is just starting to

00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:37,110
explore this and the people at the heart

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,899
of doing this really are the ones that

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:42,149
kind of experience is too much it may

00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:44,279
result in as a result of doing all of

00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:47,610
this more bug reports more changes and

00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:50,009
feedback to process and filter you need

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,230
to have in place a solid way to really

00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:54,840
filter that otherwise you're about to

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,679
use that your most valuable resource and

00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,149
force the drive in creating a product

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,220
they need to beware of tainting and

00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:05,039
making that heart of your product turn

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,169
to bleakness and just see everything is

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,750
just not worth continuing to make this

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:11,899
product though not worth to doing what

00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,909
you were trying to do in the first place

00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:18,330
you need to be conscious and really let

00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:21,480
me feel enough but not too much that

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:24,620
they spiral into despair despair doesn't

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:28,289
create a product that anyone wants

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,179
narrow testing is also a problem you

00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:32,159
need to have a board and really

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:35,039
comprehensive testing plan because

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,710
that's key to build gradually and be

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:42,590
aware again of that word respect and not

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:46,080
wasting something's time I share some

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:49,340
problems I'd like to really kind of

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:54,470
build on that with some very exact it's

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,470
take back two things you are creating

00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:05,420
take it slowly truly you are

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:08,030
fix all your problems in a day all your

00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,470
compassion problems or your stress cases

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:13,940
they're not going to be fixed in one day

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:17,630
it takes time to truly listen and act on

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,150
your stress cases be patient but move

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:23,630
forward don't fool yourself it's going

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:27,140
to be an instant process but one misstep

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:31,070
and slowly little by little and you're

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:34,840
gonna get there a longer-term goal

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:37,880
should be create a culture of compassion

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,190
this has the added benefit of being a

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,070
really productive atmosphere that

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:46,340
everybody wants to work in and that's

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,230
not bad for business either this is a

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,470
culture where everyone feels the stress

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:54,230
cases just enough where everyone has the

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,810
easing of those at the heart of every

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,490
decision in the product there are simple

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:02,360
things you can do to foster this culture

00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:05,090
that I'd like to suggest the first of

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,640
these is exposure hours and this is

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,230
often a really simple fact ensure that

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,790
everyone creating has some exposure

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,220
hours to the customers the people

00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,880
they're going to interact him and then

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,620
you actually be having that experience

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,720
this can range from one-on-one sessions

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,130
through the support time and even just

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,800
responding to reviews if you have a

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:27,020
plug-in or you have an app my best

00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,330
advice here is don't click stick to one

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,000
format because then you assume that one

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,800
person will respond better splat formats

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,390
and people respond that is riddance and

00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,930
people responded with a voice and have

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:40,520
that have that flexibility there and

00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,740
think about the future customers you

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,730
want and think about exposure hours to

00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,860
those people as well never one is

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,540
empathy challenges and then three

00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,850
challenges lower certain tasks is done

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,700
to feel what that experience is like for

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,890
that customer for example low bandwidth

00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,520
testing or even using a mobile only

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,900
device for a certain amount of time ago

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,020
I'd note here a caution again a

00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,180
filtering and doing theater and that can

00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,100
happen with this kind of n3 challenges

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,380
if you have a company with a hundred

00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,030
people don't get them all to do an

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,950
empathy challenge that was on hundreds

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,840
of bugs or

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,880
is worth four videos to process when

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,160
you're a week away from shipping that's

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,990
probably not going to have a good effect

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:29,290
on everybody you sense and respect but

00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,270
also use usual kind of common sense the

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,520
goal is to gain empathy and that's

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:37,860
something nobody gains when drowning in

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,860
work and then able to process everything

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,840
testing should be for everybody and it

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,820
also should be experienced by everyone I

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,340
don't care what lolz someone has in the

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,520
company they really should be

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:53,620
experiencing what the product is like

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,190
the feedback that you're getting all

00:24:53,620 --> 00:25:00,010
those should be exposed and the kind of

00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,590
small end of this is usability testing

00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,900
and it kind of goes in there this is the

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,270
baseline exposure you shouldn't settle

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,290
on this but you should just do this and

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:15,850
then build up from that right that is

00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:18,940
listening listening is free and it's a

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,410
skill simony seem to ignore this goes

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,360
back to creating the bubble because

00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:25,570
again how can you truly crate for

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,670
everyone when you don't listen so simple

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:32,260
to say but it's something that's often

00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:34,090
happens within products these kind of

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:38,170
it's about listening that I'm going to

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:40,690
share now I really the minimum that you

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,600
need for the streams of listening you

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,250
should also add more into this someone

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,020
should be monitoring the social students

00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,000
monitoring all the listening streams

00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:52,890
because he's a free feedback this is

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,320
amazing resource and the treasure

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:59,020
support if you are able to that I

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,510
strongly advise embedding support staff

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,910
into product teams it's incredible the

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,770
impact that this can actually have if

00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,540
this isn't possible ensure they are

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,420
being heard as the voice of customers

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:12,880
hangouts regular town halls of them

00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,650
these are the people who are getting

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,960
that exposure and can bring that

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:20,320
exposure back they can be a filter it

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,060
can be that that contact and also get

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,430
those working on the product to have

00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,230
exposure to support then back again to

00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,230
not creating in isolation

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,060
see again but not just you this is a

00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,620
point because beyond this being for

00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,950
everyone it should be done it stages

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:42,120
with the product before you create test

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:45,280
in the same market see why things work

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,820
see why people are excited about the way

00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,950
that bobs whatever does this and all

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,840
these different ways continue to do that

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:56,440
as things change I know your market is

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,330
essential to real is it don't don't do

00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,000
that kind of market ly such at the

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,260
beginning and find out what's in in

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,690
benchmarking and then you go right into

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,910
the product and then maybe you've got

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,580
like months or a year development phase

00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,990
and then you never have contact you're

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:15,250
going to be completely out of the loop

00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:18,600
that way testing without showing the

00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:21,490
results is pretty pointless as well

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,240
compile it and and have ability to

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:27,730
digest and hermas actions ensure you

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,730
close that loop with testing and closing

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,010
the loop is turning into actions don't

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,450
just test a game this is something I

00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,520
mentioned earlier but I'm going to say

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,800
it again for importance don't test an

00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,150
unfinished flow because of course you're

00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,900
going to get the bug that you know that

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,510
exists because that bug exists fix it if

00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,900
you do a couple of tests and this people

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,120
keep stumbling on the same issue fix

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,680
that issue

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,120
you're conscious of the experience and

00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,700
whilst you aren't creating a for

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,200
suspense there are send users into a

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,130
situation that they're just going to

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:07,120
report they had a problem with and don't

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:09,310
fake being a certain type of customer if

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,800
you can and then you need a certain

00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,810
stress case to experience the product go

00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,160
and get that certain person to

00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:20,920
experience that product

00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:24,100
don't try and fake that you are them we

00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:29,110
imagine a customer she's called Mary and

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:33,610
she can't ever get through sign up it's

00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:36,370
constantly no matter what you do they

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,400
can't get through sign up nobody can

00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:42,050
work out how mary will find every single

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,780
possible hitch and flow

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:46,370
and and saw people of experience their

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:51,200
customer like this they seem to be

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:53,150
amazing bug finders mary is more

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,930
valuable than your product

00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:59,180
there are a treasure she should be

00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:02,210
someone that you reach out to have a

00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,760
pool of these stress cases these amazing

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:06,200
bug find people these people that seem

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,230
to no matter wha

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,500
always hit these problems or hit these

00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:15,230
issues make them part of your process

00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,980
embrace them and if you can't do that

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:20,570
then really try and learn from them if

00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,940
they can't come into the product learn

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:28,250
from them write their behavior flow as

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:30,920
something that you check learn we all

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,690
have stress cases a lot of people

00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,230
reacted when I put the loader up on the

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:39,250
screen we can often tap into these and

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:41,870
feel what a customer is truly feeling

00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:45,230
and you think about that time that we

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:47,690
connect we don't want to think about it

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,570
but it's there and if we can feel that

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,670
and remember that and store it we can

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,640
then withdraw it from our kind of

00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,440
emotional bank later and carry your

00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,450
experience around as a balloon that you

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,880
can pull down or you can experience a

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:05,750
later when you really need to when

00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,030
you're craving a product there should be

00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,220
this product loop this is a really

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,530
simple link that's credibly complex

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:18,230
loops but the simplest one is test

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:22,280
iterate ripping that really simply these

00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:25,220
small loops often in product cycles then

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:29,150
do tiny little loops and just do this

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:31,370
test iterate repeat round and increase

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:32,930
their size maybe as you allow for

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,660
development and you allowed for

00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:38,120
complexity and once release

00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,990
stay in this loop looping like this

00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,180
checks

00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:44,000
it keeps the bubble from surrounding you

00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:46,010
through you listening to maybe only a

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,110
few section of people that are having an

00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,300
experience and really check your loop

00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,290
don't assume it's a loop they'll assume

00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,300
that you're flowing

00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,710
don't it seem because nobody's told you

00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:59,690
that there isn't a problem of you

00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:01,820
experience journey Maps is born told

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,710
that I recommend a song says what's the

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,990
one tool and that's journey mapping I

00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,640
would also say story arts kind of comes

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,399
with this as well but journey mapping is

00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:13,279
like the baseline because they have so

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,200
many benefits beyond being visual you

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,010
always work better as humans with

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,130
visions that's just the way that we work

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:23,899
but also this identifies gaps and this

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,580
is a format that everyone who's working

00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:28,640
on your product will get remember that

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,860
diversity of your product make sure you

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,480
we do an iterate on Maps though don't do

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,480
it once and forget it

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,580
nothing should be where it comes to a

00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,710
user journey that you said and forget it

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,659
this should be revisited this should be

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,659
you should have several user journeys

00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:49,909
and you should really can concentrate on

00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:53,600
doing these journey Maps empathy isn't

00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:56,950
sympathy empathizing it doesn't by

00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:00,380
itself create products you need action

00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:02,510
by embracing the stress cases you create

00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,580
just like also a better product for

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:06,679
everybody

00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:10,250
building for the stress cases is good

00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:12,710
business practice creating a culture of

00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:17,000
compassion at every level of your

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:19,700
product when you build products and when

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,190
you embrace the stress cases you create

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:27,490
products that are better for everyone

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:27,490
