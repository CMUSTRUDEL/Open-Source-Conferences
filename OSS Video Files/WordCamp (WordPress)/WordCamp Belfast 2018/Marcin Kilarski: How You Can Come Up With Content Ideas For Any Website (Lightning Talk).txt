all right so hello everyone I thank you

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,310
for coming to my talk I would try to

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,769
show you a few different ways of

00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,859
generating content ideas for your

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,020
website or anywhere in the state if you

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,360
will in which you might be working I

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,210
will show you some tools that I found

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:29,369
helpful and generating those ideas

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,740
quickly and easily for free so first

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,379
we'll talk about finding those popular

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,800
topics in your industry and then we will

00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:39,319
try to get an estimate of how many

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,539
people might be searching for those

00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:48,569
questions topics every month on Google

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:50,819
so let's start with google of the

00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:54,839
complete solution it's a feature that

00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:58,319
Google added to their search whenever

00:00:54,839 --> 00:01:01,199
you start typing a word or phrase in

00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:04,080
Google it will give you a few

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,480
suggestions of popular topics that other

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,010
people are searching every month for

00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,470
online and just to help you type in the

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,210
whole phrase you are much quicker

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,720
unfortunately Google only shows you or 8

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:22,310
suggestions which is not very helpful

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,140
for us therefore there is a tool

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:30,740
fortunately it's called answer the

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:33,540
public that pulls out the suggestion

00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,630
information from Google database if you

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,240
aren't there API and in this place you

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,580
the whole list of how to suggestions

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,040
on any topic and also adds additional

00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,580
characters after your starting word or

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,120
phrase just to give you an extra

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:56,370
suggestion more than 20 we see that it

00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,680
gives you a few hundred some two

00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,140
suggestions so there are a few different

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,780
options you cannot choose a position for

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,420
an English or Spanish Italian and a few

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,479
other languages depends on in which part

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,590
if you will operate so once you type in

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,720
WordPress in this tool it gives you a

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:20,500
and a nice visual II Listed of the

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:26,140
suggestions that you can then export

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:30,819
into a CSV and modify and filter sort

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:36,129
and Excel it gives you as you can see

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:40,299
there are 473 popular phrases and words

00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:44,319
that are found that I searched online on

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:50,099
Google this is the one of the graphs

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:57,760
that it generates with our suggestions

00:02:50,099 --> 00:03:00,549
sorted grouped and with question words

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,069
like can or where or why

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:06,129
and some of the topics that you might

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:08,920
want to write about which are

00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:19,180
highlighted here are what how workers

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:22,709
works or about what is passing here you

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:30,660
can see all the suggestion grouped and

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:30,660
trade and praises like for wave without

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:38,190
this group shows you were comparisons

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:43,209
for example workers versus a Drupal or

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:45,970
WordPress like Facebook page which you

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:50,889
can either in export is I so as I told

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:54,579
you into a CSP and start working on

00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:58,810
those topics and XO some is that I like

00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:01,120
working Excel with those lists because

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,299
you can then add additional labels

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,459
students how to suggestions for example

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:10,690
if there's a competitor and the industry

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:12,790
we can quickly filter all out to compete

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,660
with that competitor or if you would

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:20,289
like to oh you're interested in finding

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:23,140
search queries about problems around

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,440
this topic you can just filter all how

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,950
the suggestions

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,820
that contain a word problem or how to

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,550
fix something unfortunately Google

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:38,390
doesn't show also obviously autocomplete

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:42,760
suggestions and this way it removes all

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:45,500
some dangerous and fiery and valiant

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:50,890
predictions it also removes all the

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:54,080
piracy later related out suggestions and

00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:59,150
next you can also find this out the

00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:03,680
suggestion on Amazon or Ebay or an app

store on YouTube and identify what

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,150
topics are being searched on these

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,580
platforms because they are very

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,020
different from Google and the topics

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,480
will be slightly different for example

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,180
YouTube and many people will be looking

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,570

website but the website is called pora

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,280
and it's a website in which customers

00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,050
our users ask questions and community

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,980

the same time you get the question from

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:22,150
a user but also suggested best answers

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,760

on any particular topic and like images

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,700
videos articles and then that all those

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:57,970
topics are being uploaded the most

00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,590
popular one are highlighted and the top

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,860
people also have a conversation about

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:07,310
this topic so you can jump into the

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,590
conversations and try to get more

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:14,330
information from users or what kind of

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:17,450
content they like to read about another

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:20,450
method that you could use to print out a

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,930
list like this and it gives your

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,340
customer service or sales

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,660
representatives because customers are

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:32,030
asking those visitors it's all the time

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,490
questions that they have hard time

00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:37,460
finding online or maybe on your client

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:40,099
website or on your website so you can

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,010
print out this list give it to them and

00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,110
they can write down a question

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,360
that's the customer asked them and then

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,130
check the box each time this is a

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,490
question or very similar questions being

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:56,690
asked and this this way you could

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:58,790
quickly identify questions that's your

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:03,350
customer audience or customer your

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:05,900
clients customers are asking on having a

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,170
hard time finding on their website

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:14,600
because maybe it's it's not dirt or

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:18,530
maybe it's a deeply hidden deep in the

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:22,880
website so it's very nice way to look

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:24,680
and find those questions another tool

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,550
that you could use is a blog title

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,760
generator

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,460
so you basically type in the keywords

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,370
that you would like to get content ideas

00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,560
around you can select what is it give

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,780
them at it is it like a generator or

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,480
maybe it's a brand or maybe it's a an

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:45,440
event and based on the patterns that

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:49,450
they found online and most popular of

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,940
shared articles and they can generate

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:56,000
interesting titles that you could use to

00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:01,250
write articles about for example here's

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,290
a few list of 1168 potential targets

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,550
that you might be interested in writing

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,260
an article about and one more tool is

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,590
for this one is very similar but it

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,930
gives you one suggestion at the time but

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:18,790
it gives you also information why it

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:23,350
thinks this is there a very interesting

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,350
title for your for your audience

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:30,440
so now let's see in a way of how we can

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,880
and now get this list of all the

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,790
potential topics that you'd like to

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,280
write about and get information on what

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:42,290
are the most popular or most often

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:45,980
search terms of words on Google there's

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:50,840
a tool called keywords everywhere and

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:54,470
you can simply copy and add the your

00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:56,300
list to this tool it's free it will give

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,639
you an estimated

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,860
amount of times that people are

00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,129
searching for these terms and you also

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:08,089
give you a cost per click on google

00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:11,929
adwords and how competitive this keyword

00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:15,379
might be among all advertisers on google

00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:23,300
search it pulls this information for

00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:27,499
Google Keyword planner so now I'll give

around your main topic online it's paid

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,829
unfortunately but you can get a 3-hour

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,869
version for seven days for seven dollars

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:48,670
which is should be accessible to
