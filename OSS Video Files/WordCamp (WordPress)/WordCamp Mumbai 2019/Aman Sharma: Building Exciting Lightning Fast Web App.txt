	00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,230
why

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,989
okay hello guys so first of all I think

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,270
I have to do some kind of refresh work

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,000
on you guys because I think you are you

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:53,870
all are tired so can everybody stand on

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,760
wherever you are sitting please yeah yes

00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:02,180
please Mumbai what's happening okay so

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,699
this is some experiment that I saw one

00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,860
on one of the Google deaf fest and what

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,470
it is it's called a clap meter so what

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,300
I'm going to do I have my hand if I do

00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,369
like this you don't need to clap but if

00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:30,140
I raise my hand you have to clap louder

00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:32,869
okay so can we have a check awesome so

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:37,310
that means every one of us is alive and

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:40,009
is asleep so we can start so we had a

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,829
awesome session from Imran about how we

00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:44,930
can make progress a web app and I was

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:46,549
actually going to start with how to make

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,079
progressive web app but that's good he

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:51,200
has covered it very well better than me

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,090
and I will try to continue from there on

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,600
that what are the other things that you

00:01:53,090 --> 00:02:02,560
need to you know kind of consider so do

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,560
I need to turn it on guys

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:16,880
battery is down on Sharma I am working

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,880
at whim bit and also I am a working

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,680
group lead for am global so am stands

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,110
for accelerated mobile pages and we will

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,810
talk about it in this talk so just

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,410
carrying on from the last point of him

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,020
Ron and there was one question like how

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,090
do we actually match the last capability

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,160
of app that is if you really want to

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,410
place it into the Play Store so there is

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,810
a new tool from Google itself

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,760
it's called TWA it's a open-source

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,390
toolkit you can download it from github

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,670
and you can convert your PWA into a Play

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,730
Store listed app using this TWA so

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,430
that's a little last hep back and so

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,290
it's awesome you have your PWA that is

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,670
rendering as fast as your native app

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:05,300
right right guys but not always what do

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,760
we see sometimes is this thing what is

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,280
this this is a lazy loaded right and

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,870
whenever we are in India I am traveling

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,239
through trains a lot of time or flight

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,070
or like at places where 4G is not good

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,640
the internet speed is not gold our

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,830
contents and loads fast and the issues

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,769
extends which actually is kind of

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,950
problem for actual publishers content

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:31,430
creators that the pages load slow which

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,070
results in non performance of our what

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,070
we actually strategize for our App the

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,470
unresponsive pages you know all of us

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,570
are having issues with them and the

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,700
biggest problem that I face is whenever

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,350
you are trying to click on some content

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,709
add loads quickly and you mean

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:51,080
incidentally click on add right so what

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,790
if I told you like these are all

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,800
problems that not only Indians are

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,820
facing but people around the worlds are

00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,510
facing thanks Imran and that for that

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,420
particular reason I'm here so it turns

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,390
out if your ab website or an app doesn't

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,970
loads within three second 50% traffic

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:14,030
gonna you know go out so you are going

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:17,209
to lose all these people so is there a

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:21,949
solution to this guys

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:24,130
and turns out it is I don't know if all

00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:24,130
you

00:04:27,240 --> 00:05:10,779
[Music]

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,019
[Music]

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:29,450
[Music]

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:45,680
[Music]

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,360
so it was a great intro about em and I'm

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,880
gonna cover all of these aspects that

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,370
you saw in this quick video one by one

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,610
during my session so what amp actually

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,830
means is accelerated mobile pages so

00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,690
imagine right now we are all discussing

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,639
what are the best practices of how to

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,690
make website fasters what are the

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,910
various ways to do it

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,349
and everywhere we get on like you know

00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,139
on this point that there are a lot of

00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:11,509
things to remember at least some points

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,910
so somewhere we remember like let's

00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:16,009
create a notepad file or just create a

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,720
hands-off like these are the to-do list

00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:21,710
that we have to do but we always forget

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,560
so what am does is it's actually a web

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,660
framework to make your website faster

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,050
and where frameworks are not and you

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:33,680
think we got into some SPI technologies

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,560
also like react or polymer and all these

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,900
things and similarly M was introduced

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,810
but it was the first time that it was

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,580
combination of different code bases and

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,340
everything and that's why I am was

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,039
brought into this web community so amp

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,169
is not just a JavaScript or a CSS

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,020
framework it's a web frame book it

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,120
combines all the capabilities of HTML

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,280
CSS and JavaScript in order to make your

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,289
website faster so it enforces on the

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,270
performance obviously it forces on

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,310
accessibility which not much people talk

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,860
about like your website should be also

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,800
be easily seen by those people who

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,349
cannot you know use all sensory

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,120
information and all that and it should

00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:17,030
be reliable obviously even when you are

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,240
in low latency networks and your design

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:23,270
should be responsive built in so you

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,729
don't need to create it mobile first or

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,789
adaptive as one of the fellow speakers

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,680
said what if your framework really

00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:33,169
pushed yourself that your website is

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,690
automatically the design responsive so

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,699
that is what it provides and you know

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,919
guys the favorite part is the learning

00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:43,789
learning curve to this is really small

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,760
I learned amp and contributed my first

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:48,289
project in just like one week so that's

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,319
really easy and I'm going to introduce

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,999
through every

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,909
that am covers and how you can also

00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:56,069
master ramp so how amp actually helps is

00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,009
by using three components that is

00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:04,680
amperage TM L AM JavaScript and amp

00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:07,999
cachet and how amp actually improves

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,610
your website performances is it actually

00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:13,499
extends the HTML tags that you are

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,659
already using I will cover this one

00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:17,969
aspect very carefully when I'm on that

00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:20,430
slide so what this means the standard

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:23,189
HTML coding of which we are used to

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,229
using IMG tag or video tag sometimes we

00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:27,479
are not able to put you know things

00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:30,209
correctly and what happens it results in

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,039
slow performances also amp districts

00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,949
custom JavaScript to be used in your

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,630
website so because JavaScript is the

00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:38,039
main reason it runs multi thread

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,839
application sometimes sometime in the

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,659
background which results in slow loading

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,790
so it restricts all kind of custom

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,709
JavaScript but there are solutions of

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,500
how you can still achieve and have

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,899
custom JavaScript in your website also

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,360
there is a amp validator which validates

00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,540
whether your website is an valid or not

00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,410
so will make sure that also and it

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:06,720
emphases on server cachet and optimizing

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:08,279
all pages to valid am learning am for

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,550
web development is really easy if you

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,740
already know basics of HTML CSS and

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,959
JavaScript you can directly you know

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,290
jump into and start coding your first AM

00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,540
website and then it's compatible with

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,139
all webs for all modern web browsers

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,790
whether it's this Safari or Chrome or

00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,370
Mozilla it's compatible with all

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,870
browsers and it doesn't depends upon

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,380
special tooling you don't need a

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,300
specialized IDE or any toolset to run it

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,370
you can just start in your notepad or

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,410
sublime text whatever you are familiar

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,420
with and you can just include the

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,149
respective amp libraries in order to use

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,220
those components it's all component

00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:49,589
based so you only need to learn those

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,029
basics only those components that you

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,949
are actually going to use in your

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:58,079
website you don't need to learn all

00:09:52,949 --> 00:10:00,389
everything about amp and also it really

00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,670
focuses on learning by example so every

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:05,250
component that you are trying to work on

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,890
is like very familiarize with all the

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,450
example code that is available online

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:12,270
and offers a lot of things out of the

00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,460
box which will cover one by one one of

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,860
the best thing it offers is AM websites

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,990
which is a direct way of creating your

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,900
websites and web apps really fast the

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:26,520
next one is amp stories amp ads and amp

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:29,640
email so an website is a easy two way to

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,400
create user first website that are low

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,350
that are loaded in here instantly they

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,050
are compelling they're smooth and they

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,210
focus on all the design aspects of

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,070
accessibility responsiveness and also

00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,710
the performance so what is the am

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:46,170
website so here is a quick example of

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,060
how a am website look like for example

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,670
you are using IMG tag in one of your

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,890
website so this is what I have pulled

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,390
from a WordPress website and I also tell

00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,810
you how you can make your WordPress

00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,880
website

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,820
I am compatible website for performance

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,430
so it's a normal IMG tag what I have

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,250
done I have changed from IMG tag to amp

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,410
IMG tag and it automatically will

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,720
implement all the things that are

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,830
required to make my website faster even

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,750
if it includes lazy loading it includes

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,970
responsiveness scaling of these images

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,030
caching of these images everything done

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,560
by this single HTML tag so that's how

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,200
easy it is you don't need to implement

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,510
any other separate CDN or image

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,150
optimization technology so this is one

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,460
of the example same can be done for for

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:36,270
videos different ads components and

00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,100
different things so if you have used the

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,530
web recently you might notice that there

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,540
is single this bold sign next to some of

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,910
this website and when you click on this

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,210
website they just load instantly that is

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,470
what amp actually does so for example if

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,870
you are searching something on Google

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,750
which is the direct way of finding new

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,280
data as you can see in this example you

00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,500
search for something then you have these

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,960
carousel and they have a bold sign as

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,760
soon as you tap on it it loads like it

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,980
was already store on your way on your

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,890
phone so this is the best feature of

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,710
using amp code it catches all the files

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,600
to Google servers Google CDN so whenever

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,000
someone is googling your website if your

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,080
website is amp valid the content will be

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,500
loaded near instantly

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:23,070
like this wouldn't this be amazing guys

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,750
right also it is very easy and flexible

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,940
to maintain your code you only need to

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,700
code on work on those components which

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,590
you are going to use in your website and

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,480
obviously building an website is easy

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,970
there are third-party tools even

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,430
WordPress tools in which you can start

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,730
from no no brainer no coding things and

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,680
still you can make em valid websites

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,210
here is another sample code what we have

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,880
done we have imported some of the

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,410
scripts from the amp CDN which are

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,120
updated regularly you don't need to

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,940
update these libraries on your own and

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,370
then we have implemented a am geo tag

00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,260
now geo tags and analytics are the

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,660
biggest thing that are important for

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,030
website publishers to track how well

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,670
their website are performing but the

00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:08,850
problem with analytics and geo tags as

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,190
you like these analytics tools is they

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,800
consume a lot of data from the phone

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,990
even if your website has loaded it will

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,970
continue still you know fetching data

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,430
and sending data to the actual server

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,830
because it needs to record that data if

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,450
we simply replace all these code lines

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,060
and all these components with am

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:31,980
functions then it keeps like remembering

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,840
your website and whenever your website

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,630
is loaded then only it pushes so what

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,410
this means is it will keep sure that

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:42,380
like on that's the web speed even if

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,110
it's slow it's still performing well and

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,850
obviously after you implement amp it

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,430
like increases the performance of your

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,830
website by a fraction you as you can see

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,050
the first content pull paint is in just

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,530
like 1.8 second so that's what amp

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,960
website does next is an amazing way that

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,940
is amp stories so how many guys use

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,550
stories whether it's whatsapp stories

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,320
Instagram stories and I have a question

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,930
for you do you know who actually first

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,780
invented stories which social media

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,240
platform yes you are right

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,370
so snapchat came up with the idea of tap

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,830
able stories and right now on the web

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,640
it's the biggest way and easiest way to

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,500
consume content what if you can also

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,690
create web content that is capable

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,580
interactive and you can create same

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,920
Instagram or snapchat like story

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,700
feature inside your website that is what

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,830
you can do with AM stories so AM stories

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,020
are fast loading again using amp

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,300
capabilities they are full screen they

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,310
work directly in full screen and they

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,260
are tap above same as your whatsapp or

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,480
Instagram stories and they are easy to

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,880
create you can add custom animations

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,880
also as an example I will just show you

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,809
[Music]

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,390
[Music]

00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:13,990
was so in this I have AM story that is

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,730
made by CNN as you can see I am able to

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,310
tap this and there is a background video

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,709
that is playing near instantly and this

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,589
is what all am provides if we jump into

00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:26,949
the code you can see this is all am tags

00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,870
that I have used and there are different

00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:30,959
you can also implement ads and there are

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,279
different part of the story pages and

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,440
then inside you have your own grid

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,589
layers and you can go on and on am da

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:45,100
dev and see how you can directly get and

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:47,649
create your own am stories okay so the

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,389
benefits that amp so is provided as I

00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:51,670
said it's beautiful way of telling your

00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:53,560
content new way of storytelling like it

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,940
you don't need to scroll you can tap and

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,209
that that's how you can create your own

00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,040
content and obviously it for loads fast

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:02,889
near instantly and also it gives you

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,079
analytics and tracking of how people are

00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:07,029
able to reach your content right now if

00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,009
you go to analytics you can only see if

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:11,050
how much time people are spending on

00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,610
your website cannot see which part of

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,529
the content they are actually seen and

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,000
what they were interested on you can get

00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:19,920
all that information when you implement

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,720
amp this amp stories in your websites

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,060
next one is amp ads I know everybody

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,730
hates ads but that's how content

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,040
publisher earn money and what more we

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,920
hate is on a slow connection ads are the

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,589
first one that needed to be loaded so am

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,899
pads provide this kind of experience in

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:41,050
which ads loads nearly instantly you can

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:43,000
use amp ads tiles and implement whatever

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,920
ad engine you are using whether Google

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,850
ads or Facebook ads inside your website

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:52,000
and it will load near instantly and the

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,730
last one is amp emails so one of this

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,260
fellow said that amp email is the

00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,779
biggest thing that has happened to the

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,630
email since the creation of email so

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,880
what if you have to do registration for

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,309
this word camp instead of going to a

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:10,179
next form you can fill the form directly

00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:12,159
in your email box that is what amp email

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,199
actually provides you can directly

00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:17,049
interact with the web content inside the

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,860
email with just a normal coding that you

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,569
used to do with normal HTML code if we

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,000
are familiar

00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:26,069
and have used Google Docs recently you

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,779
see like whenever someone shares a

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:30,000
content with you you can see live

00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,289
changes happening directly in your email

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,059
you don't need to go and open the

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:34,950
document that is also one of the

00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,370
technologies that amp email is providing

00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,690
that you can also use in order to

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,639
provide your content users the

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,360
flexibility of amp and also enrich these

00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:47,370
things and at last amp is already ready

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,730
for WordPress there is a plug-in called

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:53,100
amp by amp project contributors where

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,429
you can just install it create your amp

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:59,250
stories create your amp stories create

00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:01,559
your pages AM valid and all the things

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,990
that AM provides and also help you rank

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,700
on the top of Google search results it's

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,769
just a tap away when you install this

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,169
plug-in it does everything for you there

00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:11,759
are amp ready

00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:13,740
themes also in WordPress which you can

00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,409
use in order to clear create embedded

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,019
websites what you can do next is go on

00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:20,759
AM to death and use all these tools that

00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:22,620
they have provided using examples and

00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,620
everything and learn amp like me and

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,720
then call yourself a contributor because

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,549
amp is also completely open-source like

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:35,220
WordPress and you can also contribute

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:37,470
features from your end so what did we

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,750
learn from him Ron's site that you can

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,389
create PWS which are nearly like which

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,029
are like app websites performing like

00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:47,970
app and then you can have em that can

00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:49,799
create new or nearly fast web pages so

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,669
this lethal combination can make you a

00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:56,370
good web developer and also already

00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:58,470
progressive web app developer because

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,049
what I believe is every faster app that

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,970
you make consume less power on your

00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:07,230
server and makes hurt the better place

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:11,539
right so that's me Aman Sharma any

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,539
