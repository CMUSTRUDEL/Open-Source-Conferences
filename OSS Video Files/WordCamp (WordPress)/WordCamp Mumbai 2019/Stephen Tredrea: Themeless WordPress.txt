okay while they getting the prison

00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:24,740
I can start just by introducing myself

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,189
my name is Steven I'm from a country at

00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,400
the bottom of Africa called South Africa

00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:33,830
from a city called Cape Town and just

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,620
before coming to India I was at WordCamp

00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,540
Cape Town and so I bring greetings from

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,550
Cape Town from webcam Cape Town it's

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,760
wonderful to be here because I arrived

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,690
in India and I can immediately meet

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,090
people that are part of the same

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,699
community as I belong to in Cape Town

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,470
and I think there's amazing connections

00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,390
like this across the world so it's very

00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:58,670
good to be here

00:00:52,390 --> 00:01:01,129
and thank you for having me the second

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,159
thing I want to say is that I'm aware

00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:07,430
that I'm here with the different accents

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,400
and although everyone speaks English I

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,760
know that I struggle to understand when

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,590
you speak so you're probably struggling

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,520
a little bit to understand how I speak

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:22,250
I'm going to talk slowly but if you

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,369
can't make out what I'm saying please

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:30,350
get my attention I will stop I will

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:32,630
repeat I'll find different words and we

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:39,710
can work like that okay we wrap

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:42,469
fantastic so this topic of a themelis

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:46,789
word press I think follows on

00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:53,390
beautifully from right because talk did

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:54,799
I say that right right okay there's this

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,549
sometimes a little bit of confusion

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:02,569
people say I need a website and I'm

00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:04,850
looking for a website designer website

00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,740
developer and we've heard from the

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,140
previous talk that there's actually a

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,450
huge section that comes before building

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,030
the website that's important and even

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,330
between what is a designer and what is a

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:21,050
developer there's a big range designers

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,030
are creative and can developers also

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,470
creative but they creative with

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,930
technology it's a slightly different

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,879
kind of creativity and somewhere in the

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,970
middle there's this thing that's

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,550
starting to be called an implementer

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,800
they're not necessarily the design and

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,900
they're not necessary to developer but

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,630
they're building they're making websites

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,870
and so my my talk today is a little bit

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:48,680
talking to that space and and my

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,620
interest in this is how is it made

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,050
easier for those people that do not have

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,080
the technical skills that can't go into

00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,540
code they haven't learned how to do CSS

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,910
and HTML and that kind of thing and to

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,820
be able to use the power of WordPress to

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,340
do amazing things without being overly

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,380
reliant on the technology so to put

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,270
power back into their hands and at the

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,380
same time what happens then is that

00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:17,570
design element gets to spill over into

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,010
WordPress as well and they get more

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,950
empowered and we will talk a bit about

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:25,730
that just now

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,470
so what is a page builder I'm sure most

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,390
of you have heard the concept of page

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,870
bore they're just a little bit of

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,120
history there we've got a new editor now

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,000
called the block editor but prior to

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,510
that we had this editor that was very

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,930
much like working in Microsoft Word or

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:48,560
some other kind of platform for

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,989
documents which was fantastic a content

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,910
management system here it is you can

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:55,010
build a website you can handle over the

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,070
client and they've got this editor that

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,840
allows him to create content that's

00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,910
amazing except it wasn't that amazing

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,239
because I had clients coming back going

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,250
I don't know how to do this I want to

00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,590
create this kind of structure and I

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,239
can't do it in this editor and I think a

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,480
lot of people were experiencing that and

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,870
that really was I think the birth of

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,090
page builders was how do we create an

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,109
editing experience for users that gives

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,109
them a little bit more power

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,430
and then we come across this thing that

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,720
I don't know if it's a term that's out

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,849
there I've come across a little bit

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,770
first generation forces jack second

00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:37,169
generator page builders now the first

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,960
generation answering that question we're

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:43,800
very much still in the back end and very

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,139
much about blocks like we take a road it

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,389
looks like a table and we've got this

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,650
block on the left which we're going to

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,680
do something with and we've got that

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,560
block on the right and you could build

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,440
up a page like that but again from a

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,659
user point of view wasn't very intuitive

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,060
and the clients that I was working with

00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:06,030
were coming to me going I want to look

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,220
at my website I want to see how it looks

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,680
on the front end and I want to be able

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,139
to edit it there wonÃ­t be able to click

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,360
on that thing and be able to change it

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,180
immediately I don't want to go into a

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,550
back-end administrative thing which for

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,280
non-technical people can be a little bit

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,310
intimidating I want to do it in a place

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,039
that feels familiar my website the way I

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,229
see it in the way my my customers my

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,479
visitors see it and that for me is the

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,849
biggest distinction between 1st and 2nd

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,300
generation the second generation went

00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:42,509
and took it in to the front end made it

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,810
visible using the concept of what you

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,580
see is what you get or WYSIWYG and at

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,740
the end of the day both of them they're

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,909
really creating a visual layer on top of

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,270
what is the basics of a website which is

00:05:53,909 --> 00:06:00,810
fundamentally HTML being the structure

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,419
and CSS which is the visual design

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:07,349
aspect and it gives you the capability

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:14,969
to be able to build websites without

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:17,580
necessarily knowing HTML and CSS so

00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:20,130
where's the state of the theme and and

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,440
we had a question that that I felt

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:27,060
address that a little bit themes are

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:31,110
fantastic themes really allowed the

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,990
non-technical person to take WordPress

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,570
and create their website and feel

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,880
powerful in doing so and themes give a

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,030
lot of options and it's been

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,950
I think it's been a certainty it was the

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,200
reason why I came to WordPress was the

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,380
power of the themes and I think it's

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,260
what's made WordPress what it is today

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,420
in terms of its incredible usage across

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:59,250
the way of powering so many websites and

00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:01,800
it's a huge number these days but

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,040
there's a problem for me and it's not

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,470
strictly a problem with themes but when

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,590
a client comes to me and they says they

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,240
say I've got an existing website but

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,900
something's not working and I need you

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,540
to help me I go oh no I wonder what

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,490
theme they've used this time because

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,460
every theme is so completely different

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,560
and when I look at it I don't know how

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,750
that themes implemented something versus

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,750
that Dean versus that theme and for me

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,700
as a developer that's very problematic

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,070
so what you'll see with with some people

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,750
who build websites is they'll stick to a

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,430
theme they'll say I want to use that

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,920
theme only because that's the theme that

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,420
I know that's familiar and all of a

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,460
sudden WordPress is not so familiar

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,150
anymore it's quite different from

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:51,090
website to website and and that's a

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,950
concern for me because if you learning

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:57,120
WordPress and you want to be able to

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:59,580
build websites in WordPress and make a

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,460
living from it potentially it's really

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,520
nice if you can find consistency between

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:09,500
the different websites and unfortunately

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,500
with themes there isn't that consistency

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:16,230
so this is what I find myself doing is I

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,270
started not using themes at all of

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,880
course you need a theme in WordPress

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:24,980
you've got to start with something and I

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,120
was choosing themes that did less

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,240
sometimes you hear the concept of a

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,760
bloated theme it's just got so much

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,890
functionality in and it's no longer just

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,080
about being the visual layer but also

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,750
about the functional layer all being

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,539
compressed into one thing and from my

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,470
background I was always taught keep the

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,880
two things a little bit separate

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,000
separation of concerns I think is the

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,529
official term and and themes became

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,449
everything and

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,550
and very very blighted and very heavy

00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:59,430
and they potentially slow your website

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,160
dad this is not all themes I'm not

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,410
knocking themes but for my purposes I

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,529
started to find what is the simplest

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,540
most basic streamlined fastest theme

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:11,610
there is and there are themes out there

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,639
that address that that do you sell

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,899
themselves as being minimal themes

00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:20,639
minimalistic basic I think the one

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,689
example that most people will be

00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:27,029
familiar with is underscores which is I

00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,949
think from from WordPress itself as a

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,990
starting point and then you can build

00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:33,269
that from that because you don't want

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,800
you as the question earlier came to you

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,410
you don't want to be dictated to by the

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,259
theme you want to have the power to

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,059
build what is the requirement in terms

00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,319
of what your clients or your visitors

00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:49,559
are needing and what you're wanting to

00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:53,670
achieve with your website which brings

00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:56,120
me the theme builders so as I started

00:09:53,670 --> 00:10:00,480
working with these minimal themes and

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,939
page builders which gave amazing

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800
functionality for having control over

00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:07,680
what you were doing within your content

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,250
area I started asking the question of

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,279
well why can't I do that in the header

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:16,920
why must I be you're limited to the

00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:19,730
theme or having to completely overwrite

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,059
it I want to use these fantastic tools

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:27,000
that they give me this front-end little

00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:31,110
capability to have complete control over

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,029
my headers and my footers and let's not

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,540
limit it to that I want complete control

00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:38,730
over everything and if I can if I can

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,779
find a way that starts to hand that over

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:47,069
to non-technical people to the WordPress

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:48,329
implementers and makers of websites then

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:49,769
I think there's a lot more that's

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:51,420
achievable and when I when I gave a

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:54,120
similar presentation in Cape Town a

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,829
couple of years back as a guy I know

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,420
it's bit cheeky in the back of the

00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:59,490
audience he says are you trying to do

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,699
developers out of a job and that's not

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:05,500
the case whatsoever but if we can pass

00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:07,810
on a lot to the implementers

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,670
the developers get to do the more

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,170
technically challenging stuff which is

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,120
generally the more interesting and

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,250
exciting stuff for developers so it's

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,860
not to do our developers out of a job

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:21,130
it's it's just empowering people so we

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,650
can achieve more okay

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,820
these tools are available out there as

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:29,790
plugins

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,790
I need a need a browser

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,430
the tools that I'm going to demonstrate

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:52,700
here are all freely available on the

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:54,200
wordpress plugin directory and with

00:11:52,700 --> 00:12:05,420
WordPress

00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:11,950
touch me touch it so I'm just going to

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,950
log into the backend of this here

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,470
what's happening here

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,290
Kim

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,730
okay so I've I've I've done a little bit

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:58,450
already I've got one of the minimalist

00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,730
themes in place and I've stripped it

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,529
down as much as this particular theme

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:07,540
will allow me to which is basically just

00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:11,950
left me with a title by the way this is

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:14,290
a very scary place to start for people

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,720
who are not designers to start from

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,399
nothing is difficult it's a lot easier

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,040
if you can start with something and go I

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,040
don't like it and start to change it the

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:29,380
the page bullet that I'm using here and

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,260
there's not the only one that can do

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:36,190
this is there's at least to my knowledge

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:39,010
five page builders at the moment that

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,019
are what I would term second generation

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,630
in other words you can do the work in

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:47,800
the front end seeing visually what your

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:50,290
design is directly and that allow you to

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,390
do it as a theme to take control of your

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,510
headers and your foot is the one that

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,910
I'm using and it's the one that I use

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,370
for most websites that I do is called

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,589
element or it's not the only one it's

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,540
not necessarily the best it's just the

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:10,149
one that that I'm using and so it's

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:12,520
easier for me to demonstrate with so

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,260
I've set up a few pages as well and a

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,940
few posts just so that we can see this

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:23,140
so I'm going to go straight away into

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:25,390
Elementor with the home page and it's

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,100
it's nothing at the moment completely

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,459
blank like I said that's a little bit

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,459
scary

00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,160
so you don't have to start with nothing

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,490
pretty much all of these page builders

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,960
will come with some kind of template it

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,930
looks like we're going back to themes

00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,480
again but not necessarily because all of

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,850
these templates whatever they look like

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,040
you can change them completely within

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,900
the page border everything that you see

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,480
the pictures the colors the fonts

00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:02,530
everything can be changed which gives

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:08,680
you complete control I'm just going to

00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:11,550
pick one so they're not completely

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,550
starting with nothing

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:31,380
okay and the first thing that I'd like

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,270
to point out is while this is fantastic

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,430
this is now only on the home page and

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,690
the idea is that we want to be able to

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,600
get the header in the footer

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:45,190
on to all pages so if I go up to this

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,149
header space over here that's got our

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,910
logo and some social icons of course

00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,610
we'd like to have a menu in here as well

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,370
in fact let's do that quickly no let's

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,600
not I'll do that later so the first

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,250
thing I'm going to do is just I'm going

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,990
to right click on this then I'm going to

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,520
save it as a template so this is one of

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,630
the things a theme builder is going to

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:13,390
allow you to do is to create this call

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:20,140
them modules or templates that can be

00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:24,029
reused again and again and again call it

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:26,260
header in fact I mean a default here

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,430
naming becomes quite important when

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,430
you've got lots of templates

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:47,739
so let's say the first female the 101

00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:49,839
was would be something like this you're

00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:51,489
going created as a template and I've

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,519
said that these theme builders allow you

00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:58,629
to reuse templates in other places in

00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:01,299
your website so we could now go to the

00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:03,279
about page and start creating that in

00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:08,350
Elementor and then bring in the header

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:12,549
because we've got it as a template the

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:16,240
thing is though that I don't want to

00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:17,799
just import the template and then the

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,750
client comes to me and says actually

00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:22,240
we've redesigned our logo can you please

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,909
change it I don't want to go to every

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,100
single page and have to change the logo

00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:29,350
I want to be able to change it in one

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,690
place where the template is and had that

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:36,309
logo now changed completely across the

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:40,360
entire site so in order to do that I'm

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:42,970
going to remove this again a little bit

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,629
scary when we just take things out but

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:49,590
I'm going to add it back in in a

00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:49,590
slightly different way

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,140
okay so first problem here is that when

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:14,170
I saved as a template Elementor hasn't

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,940
picked that up so I'm going to update

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:22,360
this and refresh it so that we can see

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:27,430
the template there and they're just

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:30,030
going to keep a check on the time did we

00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,030
refresh

00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,430
okay f5 doesn't work on this

00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,910
and that does not look good

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,810
idea

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,570
then just pop out of here quickly and I

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,570
just want to check I can't

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,190
templates templates

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,909
okay I'm not too sure why I did that but

00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:52,739
now that I've selected the template you

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:53,909
can see the look it's not actually

00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:56,879
showing the logo yet

00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:59,429
that's a font issue but it's brought it

00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:05,369
back in so what I want to do now is

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:10,609
update that we're going to go out of

00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:10,609
here into another page

00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,920
and say the about page

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:43,820
okay we don't see it yet okay it's not

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,889
there so this is the 101 version which

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,179
is not the ideal version but I'm going

00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:52,730
to show it to you just so this you've

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:54,980
got an idea is I'm gonna add a new

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,600
section and and this this talk is not

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,240
about how to use elemental so I'm not

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,029
explain the details here we go and find

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:09,440
that template widget again display

00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:12,740
template into the pic adapt default

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,240
header okay and there it is it's not

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,580
quite in the right position and that's

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,720
fine for now I'll weaken because we're

00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,549
going to do this slightly different this

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,320
is the 101 version is there we're going

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,350
to every page and we bring in their

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,169
template now it achieves one of my goals

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,570
and that it's the same template being

00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:32,149
reused again and again and again so if I

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:35,720
go and change something in that template

00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:38,419
it's going to reflect everywhere okay

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,639
but the problem is is that I still have

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:43,039
to go into every page and add it which

00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:45,230
is not great and this is where the theme

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,850
builders start to shine a little bit so

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:55,429
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:58,700
delete it again update that and I'm

00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,379
going to jump out of this now there's a

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,899
few plugins that provide this capability

00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:05,330
now in an elemental you've got a pro

00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:08,360
version the pro version will give you

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,009
all of this I'm not using the pro

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,990
version here because I wanted to show

00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:15,409
something that was accessible to people

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,370
to as many people as possible so not

00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:21,080
everyone has the pro version and this

00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,850
there's a plugin that i found called HT

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,100
maker and it's just one of a few there's

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:29,889
there's others that do this as well that

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,889
have page builder capabilities

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,850
so I can go here and this is just one

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,620
way of doing doing theme building is

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,680
that you can go into something like this

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,060
and say I want to use the header

00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:54,020
template that I've saved across the

00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:55,850
whole site Save Changes now I really

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,970
want the menu in place now so I'm going

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:05,900
to go into my elemental templates I'm

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:09,020
going to edit this default header where

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:12,220
we saw the logo and I'm going to just

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,220
pop a menu in there quickly

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,190
okay this was a home page which had

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:42,130
nothing before okay the reason why we're

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,720
seeing it twice is because when we first

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,570
created this we actually created that

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,040
header in the home page and then we

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,600
brought the template back in but

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,280
subsequent to that we've said no we

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,690
don't want to do it that way because we

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,720
don't want to have to add it into every

00:23:52,690 --> 00:24:00,100
single page so we went and we told the

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,540
female the component to rather bring the

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,860
header in there and that's why it's

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,810
appearing twice the theme bold is

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,490
bringing it in and we brought it in so

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,530
what I need to do is actually go back

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,270
into my home page and delete it there we

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,220
don't need it there anymore because the

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,710
theme builders bringing it in but as you

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,470
can see it's there and you can see that

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,440
the menus there and if I go into my bar

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,240
page where the theme build is the only

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,910
thing controlling it there we'll just

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,350
see it once and now to slip back into

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:32,350
the correct position it's above the

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:34,120
heading at this point you can use

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,520
Elementor to do whatever you like with

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,990
that header or the footer it's going to

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,130
work exactly the same way I'm not going

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:43,060
to demonstrate that it's the same

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:45,490
principle but you've now got control to

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,040
style and layout your header and your

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:50,350
footer however you want have it applied

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:57,610
across the entire site without being

00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:59,260
reliant on your theme yeah okay and that

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,540
that's pretty that's pretty much it it's

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,940
as basic as that so we're gonna go off

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:08,590
there and we're going to finish off

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:15,210
pretty quickly now how do I get back

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:15,210
into the slideshow from current slide

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:32,120
so coming up roses theme builders page

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,519
borders they're not all perfect there's

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,850
a couple of issues with them the

00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:40,490
certainly potential concerns the one is

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:43,130
we don't want page builders and theme

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,000
builders to become the next theme to

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:49,039
become the the other bloated aspect

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,440
which which is certainly potential and I

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,059
know with Elementor this there's a lot

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,059
of Elemental plugins so you can go

00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:58,490
absolutely mad and and some of those

00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:00,769
start to tie you and again to design

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,840
which is not not my objective I want to

00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:06,559
be free of that I want to be able to to

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,679
change things however I want there's

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,659
another concern as well is that because

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,370
you've got so much power and freedom to

00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:15,590
be able to style things within an

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,389
elemental you can start tinkering with

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,429
that and changing that heading and

00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:23,299
change that list over there in the way

00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:24,860
anchors control or display and then you

00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:26,919
go into a new page you start doing the

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,029
same and then suddenly you've got style

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,429
inconsistency across your entire website

00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:32,870
and again when your client comes to you

00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:35,330
and says actually we've done some work

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:38,299
on our branding and we've changed our

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,860
font and the color very slightly and you

00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,659
now need to implement that across your

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,549
whole website you don't want to have to

00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:46,070
go into every single page and find out

00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:48,200
where you've now done custom styling so

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,509
ideally what you want and some of the

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,120
pages will do this and some of them

00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:54,710
don't and this is a useful thing to just

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,899
check and when you're researching it is

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:00,169
you want to be able to style things

00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:02,389
across the entire site and one go now

00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:06,350
this is potentially one area where the

00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:12,230
themes still play a role and I did come

00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:16,240
across just the other day a another

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,240
plugin I'm just trying to see if I can

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,049
get the name of it for you

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:33,299
famous style kits so I'm still

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,140
investigating this one but it looks

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,570
promising

00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,520
it gives you the ability to create one

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,299
style that gets applied across the

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,299
entire site

00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:51,700
points in the right place not for a king

00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,250
I searched the slide okay

00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:13,250
okay just before I talk about Guttenberg

00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:14,630
this is a few minutes left I just want

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,250
to say one of the advantages of the

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,900
steamboat the concept of its working

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,240
really well is because you've got this

00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,160
control over everything you've got the

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,740
potential to do landing pages and

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,720
landing pages are becoming really

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,850
critical in website strategy when you've

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,400
got a marketing campaign and when you

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:33,740
combine combined that ability to style

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,200
something completely from scratch have

00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,300
it independent of your theme and to be

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,250
able to apply completely unique styling

00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,410
across it you can have a landing page

00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,480
that looks completely different to your

00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,790
actual website and you can have as many

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,290
of those as you like which is incredibly

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:54,080
powerful so on Guttenberg this is the

00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:57,440
the new block editor I like it even

00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,200
though I use Elementor a lot I also use

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,660
Guttenberg they're not necessarily a

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,900
replacement for one of the other what I

00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:08,120
find is that I use Elementor for

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:11,000
designing my website and then I use the

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,760
block editor for my content managers the

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,200
people are actually creating content

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,720
they're not necessarily going to go into

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,190
element or need that style control so

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,059
for them the block editor is fine

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:25,610
there's no problem there however where

00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:27,230
the block editor is going is they're all

00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,300
supposing this question and there are

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:32,600
people looking at this is what about

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,640
blocks everywhere blocks on your header

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,400
blocks in your footer and to have the

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,710
block editor as their capability to to

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,230
have that control across your entire

00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:45,170
website it's coming it's definitely part

00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:47,210
of the future where the block editors at

00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,790
the moment in terms of 1st and 2nd

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,830
generation it's certainly still sitting

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:54,530
in second generation I mean first

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:57,410
generation but it's very rapidly I would

00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,429
say moving towards second generation so

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,200
I just think it's going to be

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,710
interesting what's going to happen in

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,710
that space

00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,929
