you

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,750
hello everyone

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:25,180
Casa Chi Mumbai good hello everyone my

00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,970
name is Imran I work for our tea camp

00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,340
our team provides wordpress solutions to

00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:33,190
enterprises and today we are here to

00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,710
talk about why what why progressive Apps

00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,519
for WordPress so let me check with you

00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,559
how many of you guys are developers

00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:43,360
awesome big crowd for developer is going

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,250
to make my job a lot easier because I

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,660
know I'm not speaking to people who

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,539
probably don't know about this so that's

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,699
that's really nice thank you

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:57,039
ok what do you think of this what is

00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:59,230
this net connection here but he is if

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,140
there's some kind of a game I believe or

00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,440
that game called dinosaur game what

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,000
happens in the end

00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,320
no one knows right you never played till

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,690
here and we are just waiting for the

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,530
internet to come back how's the feeling

00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,630
when you get this pathetic right you

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,680
don't feel good the Internet is gone you

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,840
are doing something you probably

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,420
chatting with someone or using Facebook

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,590
and just goes off so hold on to that

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,880
feeling we are going to come back to

00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,750
that very soon okay so let's talk about

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,850
softwares

00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:34,750
now the hardest problem with the

00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,610
software is actually the distribution so

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,150
let's figure out about the history of

00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,360
the software distribution who knows what

00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,360
this is

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,579
who said another care engines can you

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,689
raise your hand is like how I have a

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,090
correct okay Tigger good so it's a

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,310
difference engine basically it's the

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,170
first known computer algorithm which was

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,460
written by Charles Babbage so the you

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,380
must be wondering why are we talking

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,269
about this this is about progressive web

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,060
app so the idea is that this is how the

00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:17,550
computers were earlier and then later on

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,290
you have the spread of cartridges and

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,540
cassette tapes for distribution of

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,069
commercial software so these came in

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,459
right you remember the old days when you

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:30,299
used to use these cassettes and then

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,760
came the CD DVDs floppies you remember

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,319
old days when you had to in order for us

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,790
to boot the software we had to put the

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,610
put the floppy floppy so we had to

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,799
actually purchase all of this so when

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,319
the program started to become large we

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:48,000
started using floppy - CDs and DVDs were

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,799
used so with that some for some of you

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,610
you might have this kind of a trouble

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,410
with civil deals

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,450
sometimes our system won't work you

00:02:52,410 --> 00:03:00,180
click on it and it goes out in and

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,980
things like that yeah okay but today we

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,870
have web application and software

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,359
distributions becomes so simple and so

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,299
easy that we don't have to be dependent

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,850
on floppies and DVDs etc so now in

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,560
today's world when we have all the

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,709
modern technology is what do you think

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,269
you will do when you get the DVD so some

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,000
of the guys who have mustache would

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:26,519
probably do something like this you just

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,709
take the CD and this okay so let's talk

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,260
about the trends of the mobile web

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,840
versus mobile app so when I talk about

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,329
mobile web which means opening your

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,400
links on the mobile browser and mobile

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:41,190
apps are just like your Facebook Twitter

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,989
and all other apps like so how many what

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,549
are the favorite apps you guys use maybe

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:52,030
flip card or Amazon for shopping which

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:57,340
one sorry I didn't get that

00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:00,850
pop G okay all right okay so according

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:06,520
to comScore only 13% of the users use

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:09,700
mobile web and 87% of the mobile 87% of

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,920
the users use mobile apps so why do you

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,020
think there's a difference why more

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,340
people are using the mobile apps and not

00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,810
the web can anyone tell me easy to

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,579
access absolutely

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,889
you just go onto your home screen and

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,630
you have the app you also have shortcut

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:30,310
just click on to it straight into the

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:33,040
app so first like you said easy to

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:38,320
access on homescreen they work offline

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,660
yes at least many of the features do you

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,910
have push notifications which bring the

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,280
user back in even if your application is

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,919
closed and you get a notification you

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,810
get that back right so for example when

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,490
I order food on swiggy and even if I've

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,560
closed the application I get a

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,150
notification okay the driver is on the

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,770
way or the food is being prepared you

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,490
click on the notification you can track

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,590
as to how it's going to be access to

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:08,710
mobile features and sensors like camera

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:12,180
etc now you must be wondering 80% of the

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,140
time is spent on users top three apps

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,500
which means that we don't really use

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,539
many apps now I'm going to ask you a

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,640
question that how many apps do you think

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:23,050
on on an average user downloads on their

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,030
mobile so I'm going to give you some

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,979
options so let's say an average user

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,820
downloads around three apps in a month

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:33,910
and then I'll give second option as five

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,220
apps and third one is ten apps so how

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,729
many say user downloads three apps just

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,650
a wild guess

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:43,930
raise your hand okay five apps Wow we

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,169
have five apps for more people okay ten

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,479
apps okay okay so we have like a mixed

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,100
ground okay let me tell you all of the

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,840
answers are incorrect because I gave you

00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,780
the wrong options the answer is zero

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,900
apps so in every user downloads zero

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,669
apps on their mobile now the reason for

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,200
this is because generally when we went

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,090
to the download apps when probably we

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,009
will get a new phone and we want to

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,719
download all of our previous apps

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,249
or probably some of your friends share

00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:12,129
those apps with you saying that okay

00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:16,990
this app is brilliant so like a camera

00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:18,699
app who all like taking selfies come on

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,559
guys I'm expecting more hand for selfies

00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,210
you don't wanna tell everyone we all

00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,529
like taking selfies right so your friend

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,759
tells you is okay this is a cool app for

00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,149
taking selfies let's go ahead and do

00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,719
that

00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:30,610
beautify you sometimes it makes our

00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:37,800
faces so wide that we can't even

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:39,939
recognize who that person is okay so

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,339
mobile apps what we are referring to

00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:44,319
mobile apps basically has more

00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:47,620
capability because they work offline

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,909
they have access to your sensors mobile

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,649
sensors etc however the web app have got

00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:55,689
better reach so if I had to give you

00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:58,180
some figures you'll be amazed to know

00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:00,580
that approximately hundred visits per

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,680
month for an average user and that's

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,559
according to comScore so mobile apps

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,830
have better capability while mobile web

00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:11,830
has better reach so now they're going in

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,569
different tangents if you see right so I

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,259
have better capability for mobile apps

00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:19,509
and a better reach for the mobile web if

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:21,339
we can combine both of those then

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:25,269
probably we can come up with some better

00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:27,539
solutions so let's say I combine both of

00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,539
these

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:37,790
so what do we get we get PWA

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,830
okay so we get the bus best of both of

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:43,040
the world by combining mobile app as

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:47,090
well as mobile web so what is the full

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,400
form of pwe progressive web apps I know

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,490
some people call it I'm going to be

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:56,990
building PWA apps well it's already a

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:59,750
progressive web app okay so what are

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,730
they can someone tell me okay so you

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:07,190
must have read that so who can tell me

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:10,600
what is progressive web app come on

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,310
anyone can try it's okay if you're wrong

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,180
okay can someone give him a mic do we

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:19,340
have another mic okay so you can say

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,960
your name and then you can tell me about

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,960
it squirt

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:38,349
salindra here hazard for progressive web

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,640
app you don't have to install it just

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:46,730
like a webpage you can go and access it

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,810
having the feature of the app so you

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,750
meant to say you don't have to install

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,860
it from the App Store okay awesome can

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,630
we clap as you're in there awesome great

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,940
so yes you're very close progressive web

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,670
web app are basically nothing but just

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,070
web applications that have like native

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,890
app features okay and you progressively

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:11,570
enhance your web applications with those

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:14,330
features so who knows about Flipkart

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,399
Lite you do okay awesome one two three

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,300
four I've stopped counting because I can

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,170
see there are many people who know about

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,470
it awesome

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:27,620
so what is it what is flip card lights

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:31,640
it works offline right you can browse

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,080
through different products so in 2015

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,330
they come up with this

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,450
PWI implementation they're one of the

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,190
early adopters of PWA and it definitely

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,720
revolutionized things because they work

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,510
offline even if you are at the airport

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,279
or if you are inside of an airplane and

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,959
if you want to browse through products

00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,779
you can do that so this is one of the

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,250
examples for PWA you can add to the home

00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:56,779
screen you can install it just like

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:59,510
every other app so the first requirement

00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:03,290
of PWA is it needs to be reliable which

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:07,070
means he needs to work offline it needs

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,900
to be fast ok so I'm sure at many places

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,510
not only just in India we have poor

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,980
network connectivity so it should work

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,589
so probably we can have some caching

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,700
strategy where we can cache the data and

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:21,470
then we can show the data from the cache

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,220
and it needs to be engaging which means

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,860
that even if the user has closed the

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,000
applications he should be able to open

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,079
the application when he get the

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,490
notification you click on the

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,079
notification you stayed in the app so

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,640
how do you use your app like one of you

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,540
guys said you just have to click on that

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:44,720
app app icon and then your app opens so

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,680
if we can have our PWA on the place on

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,240
users mobile

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:53,330
homescreen I think we have done a job so

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,630
what's the need of PWA so in order for

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,000
us to understand why do we build PWA let

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:02,830
us understand the difference between

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,830
native apps versus progressive web apps

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,459
so the first thing is that in native

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,440
apps which are your mobile apps you need

00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:11,209
to develop and maintain three separate

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,800
code base what are those

00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:17,209
three separate code base will be four

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:22,160
can anyone tell me android yes

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:23,600
iOS and web app okay absolutely so you

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,820
have to create a web application you

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,640
have to create one for iOS then you have

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,350
to create for Android as well could this

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,350
also mean I may have to hire three

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,270
separate developers correct however

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,089
you'll be amazed to know that in PWA

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,649
just one code base so one app does it

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:42,050
for all so probably you don't have to

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,360
hire a separate developer and you know

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,490
pay extortion amount of money because if

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,680
you want to publish your app into play

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,080
story I'm sure many of you must have

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,930
already done that you have to pay for it

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,300
and they take certain amount if you are

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,370
going to go ahead and make your app you

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,980
know chargeable etc so they take some

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,140
amount from that high-friction of

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,690
distribution however in PWA it's

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,779
accessible on android iOS web wide

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:11,810
variety of browsers native apps are less

00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:14,450
discoverable what does that mean well it

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,250
means that it won't be possible to get

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,630
it indexed by Google because they are on

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,690
your Play Store so probably you'll have

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,250
to search that app from the Play Store

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,000
and that's when you get it but not on

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,360
the web

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,579
however because PWA are web apps the

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,020
content is discoverable and indexed by

00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:34,000
search engine which is going to be good

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:36,770
for your client isn't it yes awesome

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,660
only the app download can link can be

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,880
shared however in progressive web app

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,740
you have direct link of the page screen

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,320
that can be shared how many times have

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,600
your friends you know send your link for

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,550
Play Store it really happens right

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,980
generally they send you a link for web

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:57,709
applications and you just open it and it

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:59,570
opens up in the web browser then again

00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:03,410
they are not bookmarkable however

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:06,380
progressive web web apps are the update

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,850
update the app through Play Store so I'm

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,320
sure think of a situation a lot of times

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,030
what happens you get a notification

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,130
saying that there are 10 apps that need

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,730
to be updated they eat up your mobile

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,470
data right slows things down you can see

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,500
I mean I don't like it personally that I

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,720
see that there are 10 apps being updated

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,040
so with progressive apps you don't have

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,240
to worry about it they always fresh

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,710
which means the developer who is

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,570
building that he just need to push the

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:35,020
code on the server and ultimately gets

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:38,920
updated isn't that easy guys yes awesome

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:42,890
native apps again high data usage and

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,070
progressive app saves your data now in

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,200
native apps many of the features require

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,120
the permission from the user I'm sure

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,400
you all have experience when you try to

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,290
download any application it ask you for

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,600
different permissions like do you want

00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,430
to give permission to make voice call do

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,440
you want to give permission to make you

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,680
know to access camera and things like

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,690
that sometimes I feel little you know

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,430
disturbed and annoyed that you know what

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,710
is it what what this app is going to do

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,170
with all of that access am I going to be

00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,580
hard for something so with progressive

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,320
apps you don't have to worry about that

00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,930
the only couple of permissions you take

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,850
care of that so what are different

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,260
features of progressive Web Apps first

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,190
of all they need to be progressive

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:27,530
progressive means that we could be

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,660
converting our existing applications

00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,830
into progressive web apps also it

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,720
doesn't have to be like you have to

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,520
start from scratch so you might be

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,590
thinking that I have my old project can

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,510
I convert that into pwf well yes you can

00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,060
you don't actually have to implement

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,710
everything if you want to just implement

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,330
caching you go ahead and do that and

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,330
later on as the time proceeds you can

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,400
implement other features as well second

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:53,140
one is responsive so they should work

00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,400
across the mobile tablet as well as web

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,830
they should work offline in poor

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,270
connectivity as well and of course they

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,300
should work offline mobile as well as

00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:06,140
desktop they need to be fresh so we

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,210
discussed this and save so one of the

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,550
key requirement of progressive web apps

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,889
are that they need to be secure so they

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,899
would only work on HTTPS

00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:17,629
so if your site is on HTTPS brilliant

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,029
good job otherwise it many of preachers

00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:21,470
won't work

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:24,279
they are discoverable which means they

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:27,109
can be easily indexed by Google

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,910
they are reengage ibill so you get

00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:30,589
notification or vacations you click on

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:34,459
push notification you straight back into

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:36,230
app they are durable and they are

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,239
linkable as well so you you can share

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,639
the links and you directly takes you to

00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,829
that particular link now how do we build

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,269
progressive web apps so how many of you

00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:49,069
guys have already based progressive web

00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:50,779
apps ok quite a few okay so how's your

00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:51,980
explain can many of you any of you tell

00:15:50,779 --> 00:16:01,299
me how's your experience been with

00:15:51,980 --> 00:16:01,299
building progressive web apps yes anyone

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:20,050
hello hi hi my name is Ajit all right so

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,270
I have build a couple of PWAs for

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,920
clients okay so it has been a quite a

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,030
good experience because it kind of

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,070
improves the overall user experience

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,770
because this day we talk a lot about

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,080
giving a user a better experience in

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,730
terms of it's a website or a web app so

00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,040
when you create our ordinary websites

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,470
they work when they are online but you

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,480
know if Internet is fluctuating or if

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,400
you want to give them some options where

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,580
if internet is not there and dahle not

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,440
there so but going on a PWA kind of

00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,210
removes all those bottlenecks and give

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,570
them a better experience awesome thank

00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:54,580
you

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:56,470
let's clap oh geez Boram great so let's

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,450
go into a little bit of technical side

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,700
of it so I know we've all talked about

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,710
gives me so many feature it does this it

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,660
does that but how do we actually build

00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,920
it so the question revolves around dad I

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,040
know there are so many tutorials

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,900
available on on the internet that you

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,060
can learn from but if I had to just

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,680
stick to basics what are the bare

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,270
minimum thing that I need to take care

00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,130
of in order for me to build the

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,900
progressive web apps well I give you

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,550
that confidence that the moment you walk

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,530
away from this room you will have enough

00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,910
knowledge that you can go back and tell

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,760
your clients you know what I am going to

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,380
give you a feature and they're going to

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,610
be super happy okay does that really

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,450
work there yes it will

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:36,820
so let's see how we do that step one

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:43,330
create the web app manifest anyone knows

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:44,710
what that is web app manifest sup look

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,850
so it's really hard to forget the bull

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,310
operator correct

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,420
it's okay I'm not gonna ask you question

00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:54,690
you can raise your hand if you know

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:57,340
about it okay we have a few awesome so

00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:00,580
web app manifest is nothing but just a

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:03,760
JSON file okay that contains some meta

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:06,100
information about your website so we

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,960
just tells your browser about how your

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,880
web application should behave when it's

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,710
installed on the user's mobile so in

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,570
order for you to have a valid manifest

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,220
their different compatibility so for

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,560
Chrome unit it will be called manifest

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,380
or Chasen for opera you have manifest

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,720
again same thing for Mozilla you have

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,960
manifest stored their manifest and this

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,610
one is for Microsoft

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,799
so if I have to show you how that looks

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,990
like so just because the JSON file you

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,899
just have key value value pairs so you

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,340
have short name which could be used on

00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:41,529
the home screen and the launcher when

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,389
you app gets installed so wherever there

00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:45,999
is less space it will be using the short

00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:50,169
short name and the long name is going to

00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:52,389
be put that in the name when you install

00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:55,120
your app that's when that name will be

00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:56,679
used then there are different icons so

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,080
what icons do you want to use when the

00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,289
user installs your app onto the mobile

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,570
and this used for homescreen app

00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:06,309
launcher task switcher splash screen etc

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,960
I'm not going to go into detail of the

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:12,220
code bit because that can definitely be

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,249
explored later then you have the start

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,259
URL well this means that when the user

00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:21,940
opens the application from the mobile

00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:24,820
what page should it land to theme color

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,940
what will the theme color of your app

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,230
and the background color is well and

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,809
display stand alone means that whether

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,580
you want to show a web bar on top or not

00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:40,240
so this would mean that it will be on a

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:41,499
stand alone mode okay you have scope you

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,340
also need to tell you a browser about

00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:46,840
the manifest you just need to link it if

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,389
I have the check about the browser

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,039
support for this manifest you can see

00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:53,559
chrome is always on the top because of

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,659
course built by Google and then you have

00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,139
edge that's supported in the latest

00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:01,240
version iOS Safari has some support for

00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:02,679
it not all will come back to iOS because

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,019
I'm sure many of you must be wondering

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:09,039
that will it work for my iOS or not so

00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:12,039
we'll come back to that next thing is

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:16,539
service workers who knows what a service

00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:20,580
worker is okay many of you okay yes you

00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:20,580
can tell me Mike please

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,090
okay awesome now you can say your name

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,030
and then you can tell us about it

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:35,610
I I'm Ashwin yes and what I know about

00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:38,880
service workers are actually these are

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:42,750
the the files or code which will make

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:46,350
your website into a pwn at its features

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:48,060
okay so this is where our coding will

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,170
take place awesome awesome thank you

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:54,510
very much let's clap for him guys

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:57,090
awesome okay sup look was there a mr.

00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:59,070
BOTS come Kara Habakkuk ionica but now I

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,810
just wanted to relax and chill out in

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,180
the air-conditioned is asking me to talk

00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,040
and clap and things like that so there's

00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,800
for my talks it's gonna be like a

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,170
two-way thing right because you spend

00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,390
your time coming over here listening to

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,740
me and you know putting all of the

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,940
effort so it's better it needs to be

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,710
two-way things so that when you leave

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,750
this room you have something to take

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:23,730
away is that good yes awesome so what

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,710
are service workers like he said service

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,200
worker is just a script your browser

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:32,580
runs in the background I separate from

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:35,310
your web page so let's say you have web

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,160
browser okay so web browser what does it

00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:40,170
do it makes an HTTP request to the

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,830
server so what service worker will do is

00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:45,870
it will act as a middleware and it will

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,960
intercept that HTTP request when people

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,850
score rogue they go and then over there

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,040
it will check if some data is there in

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,660
the cache it will go ahead and serve

00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,940
that from the cache or it will make a

00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,270
network request to the server we will

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,220
get into detail of that in some time so

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,290
there's a life cycle for service workers

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,510
there are three different phases of self

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,880
service worker life cycle first is

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,370
register as is the time when we register

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,500
a service worker then you have the

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,140
install event so there are different

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,670
events that take place and we just you

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,520
know attach a function at this point

00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:22,320
whatever we want to do so we add files

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,400
to cache at the time when it's installed

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,080
and then when it's activated then we

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,580
delete the previous cache because there

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,770
could be some data that will be stale

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,020
for example if you publish up a new post

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,780
or update a post then I don't want my

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,940
user to get the old data the stale data

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,539
he needs to get the new one so that's

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,779
why we need

00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:44,549
the previous cache step two we register

00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,039
the service worker so there's some code

00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:49,619
you first check if the service worker is

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,979
in navigator if it is you just register

00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,960
it

00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:54,809
so that's your SW RG s is a service

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,549
worker file URL then if it is registered

00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:58,889
you get a message that yes it is

00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,389
registered otherwise you get an error so

00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:05,100
you just need to register it basically

00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:08,519
that's all is happening over here okay

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,320
step three add files to cache so you

00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,729
create a cache version the reason why we

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,619
are creating a version so that when we

00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:14,970
update something we can change the

00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:17,279
version of the cache and then it will

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,309
automatically delete the old cache and

00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,679
put the new one and then we just put the

00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:24,479
urls of different cache inside of it so

00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,869
you have indexed or HTML that's my route

00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,700
one

00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,799
you have manifest your jason and your

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,929
images your CSS file so you will put all

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,399
of that here later on we are going to

00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:37,049
loop through all of this and just put

00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:38,580
all of these in into the cache so on the

00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,649
install event if you remember from the

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,139
previous picture once the serviceworker

00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:45,239
is installed we go ahead and all add all

00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:50,700
of those files that we just saw into the

00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:54,419
cache step four we delete the previous

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:57,239
cache like we discussed so we listen to

00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:59,369
the activate event we loop through each

00:23:57,239 --> 00:24:02,190
item in the array and we go out and

00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:03,929
delete the previous cache if we match if

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:10,229
we find that the cache version has

00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:13,470
changed okay so if I had to see that on

00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:14,729
the browser and if I do a console you

00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,409
can see that there are different events

00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:18,899
that are triggered so service worker

00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:21,239
installed caching files then service

00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:22,679
worker got registered activated we are

00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:25,409
checking if there is a new cache version

00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:30,509
and in this case there was no new

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:33,239
version were found now if we go back and

00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:34,769
check into applications tab when we do

00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:37,470
inspect element you can see this is a

00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:40,470
serviceworker there's a source status

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:44,220
all of the information is available for

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:46,529
the serviceworker over here and if I go

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,999
to manifest it tells me the theme color

00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:50,460
the background all of this information

00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,960
that we had put into the manifest dot

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,450
JSON file and you also have the icon

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,480
that is being

00:24:52,450 --> 00:25:02,610
used over here and you can see this is

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,110
where the data is stored as cache

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,650
so once the serviceworker is activated

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:10,660
has got full control over the pages and

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:13,660
it can now handle events such as fetch

00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,430
push and sync so pushes for push

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,410
notifications sync is to sing the data

00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:21,400
in the background and fetch is to fetch

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:23,290
the data so let's say this is my web

00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,970
browser so it does a push cord Akagi I'm

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,740
sure coffee Cochise and SMS me wrong

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,840
it's completely fine it's just an

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,610
overview of it but I'm sure this diagram

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,590
will help you understand how things work

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,290
behind the scenes so let's say this is

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,030
your web browser it makes an HTTP

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,120
request let's say for the home page or

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,650
about page for anything for that matter

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,770
what we'll what serviceworker will do is

00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,120
it will act as a middleware and then it

00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,880
will intercept that as should every

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,700
request it's going to check if the data

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,830
if the request you are as in cache if it

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,190
is is going to serve the data from the

00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:59,860
cache itself if it isn't then is going

00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,810
to get the data from the server and it's

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:05,170
going to feed the data back to the web

00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:11,140
browser with the data from the server is

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:12,610
that clear enough yes awesome fresh data

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,010
from the cache this is how we do it

00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,310
if programmatically with the code so we

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:20,320
listen to the fetch event then we go

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,150
ahead and send the response from the

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,590
cache if it is available in the cache

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:28,480
otherwise we make a network request

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:30,070
using the JavaScript fetch function okay

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,080
if I have to check that over here you

00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,840
can see all of the fetching event

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,480
occurred to our main dot CSS main dot

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,830
J's your images all of that so all of

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,550
the fetch event is occurring over here

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:45,940
when we load that in the browser and now

00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:47,620
you can see over here so this point all

00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,690
of these data is coming from the

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,830
serviceworker so a serviceworker is

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:56,440
fetching all of that information from

00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:59,110
the cache when we go offline okay now

00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,090
adding a custom add to homescreen so

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,000
once you've done all of this stuff of

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,659
course you've got all of the PWR done

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,340
but if you want to add

00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:10,039
at the home screen button you can do

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,929
that by this so this is basically a

00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,610
quote for that I'm not going to go into

00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:16,490
the detail of it but you just listen to

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:19,460
before install prompt and you go ahead

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,320
and grab hold of the custom element that

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:27,320
you have created and you just go ahead
