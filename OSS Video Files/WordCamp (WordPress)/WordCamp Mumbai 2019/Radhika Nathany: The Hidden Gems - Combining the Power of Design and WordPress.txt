Title: Radhika Nathany: The Hidden Gems - Combining the Power of Design and WordPress
Publication date: 2020-02-03
Playlist: WordCamp Mumbai 2019
Description: 
	Getting the emotional connect back in place will never hurt! I would want to talk about how customers can achieve even better results when they combine the power of a platform like WordPress with pre-planning and being better thinkers to connect with their audience better. I am not a UI/UX designer. I would want to focus on the thinking, emotional elements, the kind of message, the understanding of the users, the goals that can further enhance the experience of any website!
