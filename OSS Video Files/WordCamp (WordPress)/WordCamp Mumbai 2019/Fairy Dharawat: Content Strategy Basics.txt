Description: 
	Writing is like that you know. There is just so much out there to learn. If one thing she wants to tell you, then it is to read. Read good books. Thought provoking books that challenge you. That’s how she has grown over the years. And that’s how you can grow too.

	00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,730
my name is fairy The Hobbit and Irene oh

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,510
right oh okay right

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,220
only a write-off and I'm taking a topic

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,820
of content strategy but I've been a

00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,900
writer for around seven and a half years

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,090
six and a half or seven and a half years

00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,309
but I've been working for ten years in

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,090
the corporate world and I've been right

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,850
now as long as I can remember but as the

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,900
industry progressed we had to adapt and

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,650
we had to take this word content really

00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,510
seriously so every presentation not

00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,280
supposed to start with anything negative

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,730
but I am going to do that because I made

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,640
a bet I do not like the word content and

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:10,650
I will tell you why

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:14,700
so yeah I'll just give a bit of brief of

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,560
why I do not like content I've been

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,600
working as a Content writer for a long

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,740
time and then later I worked as a

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,440
Content strategist

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,130
okay literally I had that designation

00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,530
and I still find it so confusing and as

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,929
I said I'm a writer my role as a

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,069
strategist at that time was writing but

00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:37,619
right now in 2019 you're not supposed to

00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:42,300
be writer you have to be really an idea

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:44,789
ting person so that is difficult so me

00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,140
when I think of myself as someone who is

00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:52,200
in the industry he finds it so confusing

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:55,800
how can i spiring content people really

00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:01,259
make it so I will tell you exactly why

00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,850
it is confusing so before that I want

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,380
this to be really interactive because or

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,360
else I'll be keep on talking and you

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,770
will just leap and I don't want that and

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,280
you know why I say that you're gonna

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,230
sleep because I've slept so yes I would

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,610
love to if even if I'm talking and if

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,390
you have a question just raise your hand

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:21,120
and I will stop and I'll take a question

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,730
right because I do realize questions

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,230
come when someone says and if the

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,750
question comes right away it's more

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,599
fresh and it's more to the point again

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:35,120
so yes why basics why basics

00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,430
I really feel very strongly for basics

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,159
because when a basics assorted you are

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,560
sorted when I get confused which I do a

00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,719
lot because it's trite thing I keep on

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,260
reading a lot I keep getting distracted

00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,189
I keep zoning out which I assume some of

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,989
you are doing that right now

00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:57,650
so basics are very important because

00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:00,040
they can rescue you as I said when I was

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,040
a writer

00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:08,840
when I was a content strategist I all I

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,299
was doing was writing and into that

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,919
specific too big to be more specific I

00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:16,189
was a blog that I talk

00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:19,280
is there any blog right or right now can

00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:21,379
you please please raise your hands okay

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,049
spiraling bloggers yes aspiring

00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,629
daughters okay awesome

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,459
very few okay for you you guys have to

00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,409
write writing is very important and I am

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,069
saying as someone who gets bread and

00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:35,949
butter right oh I want competition I

00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:38,900
want everyone to be a writer because

00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,909
it's so important and that's a totally

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,120
different topic we don't go there

00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:45,769
but yeah content strategy is so huge and

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,799
all I was doing was only blog writing

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:52,250
and because if I do not update myself I

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,530
wouldn't get a job that is why basics is

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,359
so important what is content can anyone

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:03,049
just try play around and say what is

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:08,090
content please yes what is content mr.

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:10,430
Ajit Basra you know I I do realize that

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,669
and it's funny because I did incorporate

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:18,820
that you as a content but still let's

00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:18,820
play around what is content yes

00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:28,610
like

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:31,800
specific topic okay you basically like

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,259
like exactly like well basically like

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,680
when I write a content for my any niche

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:40,949
blog so I obviously I write with both

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,620
purpose like for the viewer as well as

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:46,409
for the bottom fantastic for the

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,449
Googlebot but I would humbly like to

00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:51,539
interrupt you because that said as I

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,949
said I started well I started by saying

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:54,599
I'm a writer okay

00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,879
and I started saying that I'm a blog

00:04:54,599 --> 00:05:01,219
writer but content is not just writing

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:05,280
and that's what we tend to make big

00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:13,949
mistake about we are visual creatures

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:15,449
yes oh yeah so are you come again might

00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:17,669
either you are looking for so it's one

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,099
part of it it's definitely one part of

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,139
it and to be more precise it's for SEO

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,060
like if I'm trying to find something I

00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,789
should get it on fourth page that that

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,969
is still part of content started and yes

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:31,259
you had a question so for me in general

00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:33,060
content means the experience because

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,650
that give you a lot of material like if

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,840
I am talking about writing a blog post

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,759
or you know writing poetry's or anything

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,259
for me it's experience like from morning

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,630
to evening what I am doing

00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:45,389
interacting with people communication is

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,909
content everything around that you do is

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,380
content true absolutely - I'd really

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,090
agree with you but when it comes to

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,879
brands and capitalism we need to get

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,580
money out of it so I'm gonna talk more

00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,889
about how to really use SEO and those

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,810
things to get the result what do you

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,849
want because when you're working as a

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,539
Content strategist in a corporate world

00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:08,370
data is not enough trust me because I

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,680
love writing poetry I love to write

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,779
fiction but do I get that clicks do I

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,270
get that leverage key ok ferry as a

00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,060
brand has really gone ahead ok she

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,000
writes poetry a people gonna really

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,879
invite oh no I have to see that it's SEO

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,009
friendly but then SEO is why is use

00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:34,080
social media or social media and content

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,669
is any is there any connection yes there

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,240
is

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:39,860
so yeah I'll go back again why basics

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,050
I'm gonna really focus on it because

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,029
even right now I've been writing for 10

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,449
solid yours I've been writing it I got

00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,129
star

00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,870
I started getting paid after seven years

00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:51,340
and I still go to basics because I

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,340
forget because it's so huge

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:58,430
what is Condon we just figured as he

00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:04,849
said everything is kinda kinda is

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:07,550
confusing because it's everything that

00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:10,669
is vague if I have to go too early

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,770
precise in what is content which is not

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:16,009
into the physically like me and you as a

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,349
content not the tangible thing if you go

00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,860
really on line one online version what

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:25,279
is content it's what you read on a blog

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,409
it's the ad that you look into the blog

00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,159
that you're reading it's it's that game

00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:29,990
that you're playing

00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:32,240
it's that photo that you're looking at

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,219
it's the tags that you use for that

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,979
photo that you're using at its the title

00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:38,779
that you write for a blog it's that

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,699
short five-minute video that you're

00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,439
looking it's at stand-up comedy that

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,810
you're looking it's at web series that

00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:49,069
recently got you know a lot of backing

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:51,560
by Netflix Netflix is content Amazon is

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:54,979
content every streaming thing I ever

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,819
seen as content images did I cover

00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:00,889
everything yeah chips are content I mean

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,080
everything is content and do you realize

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:05,659
how difficult that makes for a simple

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,460
writer to really keep up I won't I need

00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:09,759
to keep my job a lie how am I supposed

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,009
to like update myself all the time but

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,979
that is content everything is content

00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:18,469
right so if someone tells me what is a

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:20,839
folio or a profile of a Content

00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:23,629
strategist they'd only need to

00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,189
understand social media they'd only need

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,949
to understand what goes into the web

00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:33,529
world world of web everything that you

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:36,740
see online but you know what as we go as

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:39,409
we evolve even while you're looking at

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,709
traditional is content the newspaper

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,390
that they are still deters newspaper is

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:47,029
also continent because when it comes to

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,880
advertising your job is to leverage

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,680
tradish

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,450
and modern mediums to make sense because

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,210
let's face it brand awareness and

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,490
everything is okay awesome but it feels

00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,380
that we want we want money we live in a

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:05,190
capitalistic world yes we do and we want

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,230
to convert everything that gets clicks

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,710
and all ultimate thing is to get money

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,660
or if it is not money if it is not

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,210
otherwise return on investment it's

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:22,740
social capital do you know what social

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:24,920
capital is yes okay yes it's part of it

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,410
it's part of it so you can say it's a

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,450
strength of influence so like if I say

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,280
something and you guys do it that means

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,620
I have that much social capital so you

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:39,840
can simplify it by saying being an

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:42,060
influencer so it is everything so

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:48,060
doesn't that make content strategy a

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:50,700
little difficult I can do you it's it's

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,520
stunningly different and difficult

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,130
because as I'm saying around two years

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,650
back as a Content strategist all I was

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:03,300
doing was this writing and right now I

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:05,610
have to really make my portfolio grow so

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,340
now it's ecommerce e-commerce like huge

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,020
and if I'm writing a blog about hey this

00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,690
is amazing tiles and you should buy it

00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,240
now I need to change that entire

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:20,040
tonality for Amazon or Flipkart to make

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,960
it more catchy and action-oriented so

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,520
people actually spend money and buy and

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,950
for that I need to have good knowledge

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,390
of SEO into a good knowledge on what

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,780
really works I need to know the

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,860
psychology of the consumer or people so

00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:40,200
it is confusing and that is reason you

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:45,210
should go again to basics so I really

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:48,330
wrote this entire PBT which I suggest

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:51,090
you do take it because it's just what

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,950
I'm saying is going to go a little here

00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,170
and there this is more specific so it's

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,350
basically what I just said you can take

00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,820
this once the session is done and yeah

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,020
so it means you don't want click before

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,640
oh yeah that's what I said why'd it

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,970
start

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:08,660
yes what is strategy does anyone play

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:12,320
chess have played chess once okay so

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,210
it's you have nice you know so you know

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,810
about strategy right you think about

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:22,010
your each move right okay so if this is

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,490
pawn a small pawn

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:32,020
it can only walk one step how do I use

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:32,020
this one point to its maximum benefit

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:40,190
it's so bloody specific I'm sorry I'm

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:42,170
using it it's so specific I mean yeah I

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,520
use the word astonishingly I don't use

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:48,920
this often it's so specific you should

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,050
know it's so ball oriented you need to

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:56,720
know exactly what you're doing and why

00:11:51,050 --> 00:12:00,260
you're doing both can become difficult

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,120
when you know that the content part of

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,730
is so huge so you can say it's the

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,020
opposite it's this is a vast quantities

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,330
of us and now you're talking about

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:12,350
strategy which is so specific now how to

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:14,060
use this for your brand what is your

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:22,250
brand okay give me a suggestion for a

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:23,810
brand coke so coke an interesting fact

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:28,130
do you know Coke and Pepsi has the base

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:32,780
same customer customer base and how they

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:34,640
are actually using their strategies if

00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,770
you really go down to basics are the

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,570
same and they share the same customer

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,210
base and the only way they are

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:44,450
differentiating themselves is Coca Cola

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,660
is happiness and Pepsi is swag so Pepsi

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:50,090
is more I going towards a college-going

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,250
kids and this is happiness which is like

00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,930
huge we want everything but still even

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,740
after all these things the customer base

00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:00,080
remains the same and the only ad

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,140
campaign that works is like bombarding

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,090
us with ads because they got money they

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:09,130
got huge piles of money and they can do

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:12,290
that we as a small brand can we do that

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,510
we as a small brand can we be like Pepsi

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,260
or a Cola or Pepsi Cola even can we be

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,230
like that

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:23,120
can you burn money like that No

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,620
and that is why content strategy becomes

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,320
even more important because you have to

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,030
be very specific on what you want and

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,840
you need to know how you're gonna get

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:35,120
how are you gonna achieve that goal

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:41,210
so yes content strategy school oriented

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,280
long term and short term so the best

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,050
what Coke and Pepsi does is long term

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,840
they gonna like just bombard you with

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,280
stuff and it's the kind of bomb bar you

00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,070
so bad that you just gonna go to a

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,720
shopkeeper or a mall and just look at it

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,630
and just grab it that's Brian D call

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,700
value you just take it brand

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,800
communication with CTA means if I am

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,140
having an event of my company is having

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,220
an event it doesn't make sense that I

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:10,450
just do it in a small way like maybe if

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:14,360
I'm using X amount to promote it I

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:16,760
shouldn't do that same for the short

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,540
term brand communication with CTA is

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,990
called to action

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,700
I want the users or the or the audience

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,070
to do something which is more

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:29,140
action-oriented so your content strategy

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:33,680
is going to be different so much and

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:36,290
again this is basics this is very basic

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,350
and if you really have to know how to

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,360
create your basic content strategy you

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,700
have to divide it between this and and

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,380
when he said what is long term time and

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,630
what to short some time you need to

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,000
understand Coke and Pepsi they have been

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,550
here since longest time and what they

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,650
did was mostly brand awareness and brand

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,220
communication with CTA they used to go

00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:00,290
back and forth they played the long game

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,770
we don't know if we are starting out if

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:06,770
we can afford to play along so maybe you

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,870
can have a short-term plan with

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,940
long-term effects and vice-versa and

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,850
that is the reason you really need to

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,440
have product knowledge and again what is

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,940
your goal you need to understand that

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:25,460
you have to introspect so did I confuse

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:28,340
you enough awesome because I was

00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,940
confused and I walked as a strategist so

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,990
yeah

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:35,600
a bad job what works VD was trying to

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,030
work a lot Netflix and Amazon and all

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,040
these people have really changed the

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,480
game now Disney class is coming that is

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,070
also content there are so many new

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,000
people who want to have their own series

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:50,150
they write books do comics they're

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,110
changing the game but videos is a safe

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:59,570
bet Facebook thought that it's gonna be

00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:05,330
so popular that it actually elevated the

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:08,150
numbers okay they elevate they lied to

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:11,840
people and use our platform use videos

00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:14,270
to compete with Google YouTube compete

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,540
with YouTube what they did in the

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:20,240
process they destroyed journalism when I

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,590
say destroyed so many BlueTEC

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,260
journalists lost the job so yes we'd use

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:31,750
work I mean if you just go go go on

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:34,940
google and type best way to attract

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:37,610
consumer all the audience videos will

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,850
come first it's interactive it's fun

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:43,670
it's visual it's colorful vibrant why

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:47,210
not but you can't really believe these

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:56,090
platforms to give you best organic reach

00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:58,070
is not really so so what to do but

00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,900
before before doing that please do this

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,790
Facebook videos just write journalism

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:07,280
it's interesting it's good for your

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:09,500
knowledge yeah so honestly even I don't

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,069
know it's it's trial and I know yeah

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,050
it's not a very bright picture right but

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,699
making mistakes really helps you never

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,130
know what's gonna work what's not gonna

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:22,040
work

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:24,110
Rondon strategy is so goal-oriented that

00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,319
it doesn't have destination for us

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:29,690
when you say content marketing marketing

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:32,030
is like it's a place you give your best

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:36,770
that's it content strategy is a process

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:38,330
and that process can not be even a

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,000
process of you're not making mistakes

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,169
and because what content strategy is so

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,239
huge it it has a

00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:48,710
everything and ideally you should have a

00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:51,859
small you should do a bit of everything

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,799
that is memes or Jif or videos and blogs

00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:56,389
guest blogging website content you

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,029
should do a bit of everything social

00:17:56,389 --> 00:18:04,609
media everything you are going to make

00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:06,799
mistakes your job as a successful I will

00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:08,989
I will personally say successful content

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,820
strategist is to bounce back from making

00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:13,159
mistakes because honestly you can not

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,769
learn without making mistakes it's just

00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,169
that you have to be so strong you have

00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:20,059
to you have to have this appetite for

00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:23,299
knowledge for reading that you can

00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:27,409
bounce back from making mistakes so if I

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:31,159
have to give my personal anecdote or an

00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:34,190
experience social media is like really

00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,619
twisted don't get likes and shares or

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,659
whatever social capital as I said when

00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:44,299
he wanted white on Twitter which is the

00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:48,950
most difficult platform to get leverage

00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:52,039
or you know get more people to notice

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:58,129
you I did one post and I didn't do

00:18:52,039 --> 00:19:00,109
anything I just described the image and

00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:03,440
I got more than thousand likes on

00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:05,690
Twitter I honestly don't know why I why

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,450
I got that I just described the image

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,419
that's it it was a retweet and I'll

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,700
share it you can ask me it's it's an OK

00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:16,100
image that I can show it you know it's

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,509
Romanian movie but it works for me as a

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,820
social capital' I get more Twitter

00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:21,489
followers I can write more I can get

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,779
more opportunities and all that jazz so

00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:26,809
it's trial and I know I try something

00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:29,119
again like that it didn't work then I

00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:31,700
realize the only reason it worked was

00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:34,129
because the author of that we eat liked

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,139
it so now I know that I have to do

00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:39,830
something that that account again likes

00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:42,139
me with then happen so that's it it's

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,450
it's trial and error and as I said it's

00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,429
a process and in the process you will

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,919
make mistakes and your job is to see to

00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,450
it that you are ok with making that

00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,919
mistakes and you bounce back and you

00:19:50,450 --> 00:20:01,070
learn that is the only way and basics

00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:06,769
go back to basics oh yeah so for the

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:11,869
simplifying things what if you are a

00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:15,379
product so okay let's create a content

00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:16,940
strategy for you like mr. Ajit both

00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:19,159
Roger said content is everything

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,869
quantities me and that is so true and if

00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,989
you had to create a content strategy for

00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:27,049
you how you're gonna go about it does

00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:31,519
anyone actually want to volunteer or

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:33,999
should I just talk about myself are you

00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,999
sleepy enough

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,120
I can pause I learned how to be pause so

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,650
that I would feel uncomfortable you guys

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,180
are gonna feel uncomfortable I'm going

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,660
to stop talking now and someone has to

00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,660
wall it down

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,680
as in yourself me if I were to conclude

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,020
a contest rally for myself I guess I

00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,510
created a strategy a while back

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,480
and it seemed to work for me yes great

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,040
so not many folks remember might be

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,980
people remember that I used this hashtag

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:12,190
called pockle Alba Raji yes I rendered

00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,840
myself as one who talked endless who

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,420
talks senseless because you know now

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,970
life is too serious and I don't want to

00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,140
be that so I used I created the strategy

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,540
around where I you know I talk about

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,370
things in a humorous way where people

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,380
were able to connect with it well which

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,530
they don't say in public but yeah I was

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,880
like my bulaga whoa and when I went to

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,770
different verticals people were easily

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,530
able to recognize me and they were like

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,480
okay hamare poker all Balaji are so that

00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,310
kind of work for me because humor is the

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,590
element that I want to attach to myself

00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,990
I want to be that guy you know who is

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,220
not serious who speak his heart how they

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,740
were yeah but the moves have all their

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,530
cynical Ryo but so so much Guinea Volta

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,530
so that strategy worked for me I kind of

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,550
created a brand of myself rounded

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:59,140
awesome can we just have a round of

00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:01,060
applause Pete and that's exactly what

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,400
I'm trying to say strategy is so

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,130
personalized it worked for him and it

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,710
did I know I remember it has that like

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,570
hashtags supposed to be very not

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,250
readable but it it you can remember it

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,140
right to it and that works

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,790
it has rhyme it has very it's

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,620
alliteration alliteration tends to

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:21,160
really help you remember things that's

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,660
why your poems school poems were so

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,730
rhyming because they they have

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:29,230
alliteration and they had that inherent

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:30,580
rhythm in it so yeah I mean totally go

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,860
back to basics

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,620
why do you what if you have to do a

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,690
content strategy for you so as he said

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,600
everything is wanted and I just focused

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,030
more on the allow can be using it is so

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,040
we again I'm gonna go simplify it what

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:49,960
if you have to create an online strategy

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:54,100
for you so let me try doing that if I

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,400
have to create it for me then I am the

00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:00,250
product like if I am a product what does

00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,960
this product is it's me in my tangible

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,410
physical form that's my hair I is

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:08,030
everything this is me as a product

00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,820
brand strategy and garden strategy again

00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:13,490
comes really close to side-by-side and

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:17,090
it's confusing but Brad so once your

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:19,100
product is done you go to Brad so brand

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,260
strategy is different it's how to get

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,820
more people to look at your brand but

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:26,180
how to create your brand from the

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,570
product so I find the product my brand

00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:32,360
is going to be my attitude and my

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:35,960
personality so my attitude would be how

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,560
do I respond to situations around me all

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:43,070
react personality would be what kind of

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:45,530
emotions or vibe I elicit like from

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:52,640
people like you what do you think of me

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:56,000
that would be brand it brand is mostly

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,870
attitude and post personality so brandy

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,850
keeps saying that brands going entirely

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,500
personalized Google brand

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,840
personalization you will get it and

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,560
that's why this example I'm pretty proud

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:13,010
of it so if I'm up if I want to create a

00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:17,020
content strategy for me I am the content

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,020
that means I'm the product my

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:24,650
personality not attitude is my brand and

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,780
why do I want to do because it's a

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,690
strategy thing it's the journey what is

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,780
my goal now here you can do anything in

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:35,180
everything do I want more social capital

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,640
I want more influence I want to be more

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:42,130
fit I want to be successful

00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:48,200
I fix one goal and try working on that

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:52,820
let's say I want to be the source of

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:56,060
knowledge okay that is my goal so what

00:24:52,820 --> 00:25:00,350
would be nice strategy to get that goal

00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:03,850
somebody needs to help me with that now

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,850
we are all sleeping

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,540
it's not huh you are weak no so okay

00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,970
I'll repeat my question

00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:18,900
if my goal is to be the source of

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:24,780
knowledge what will be my content

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:27,410
strategy I can stop talking you know I

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:32,520
can just stand or that's fine

00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:36,530
someone please what I do not you someone

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,530
else yes

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:58,809
okay yes yes yes okay so if yeah if my

00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:01,120
strategy was to but my strategy would be

00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:07,900
to create knowledge and share knowledge

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:12,510
hmm so right tutorials and some blog

00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:15,550
posts about knowledge itself no that's

00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,929
that's not that's me like when we talk

00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,280
about strategy it has to be goal

00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:20,350
oriented yes but it has to be fairly

00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,140
specific I use the word astonishingly so

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,390
I you know I just didn't know no this is

00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,340
right in a way but I'd only want to

00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,230
focus how specific it is you said that

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,330
blog tutorial it's great that's nice

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,179
then you saw some blog posts oh no it's

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,429
not like that you need to have proper

00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:38,980
subject or title in place and that is

00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:41,380
why to make a content strategy work for

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,720
you you have to be insanely specific

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,420
it's only then you'll get returns but

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,640
thank you thank you for saying yes you

00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,530
had some good yeah hi my name is sue

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,020
Rika and that's what I was about to tell

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:55,900
you you have to create specific content

00:26:53,020 --> 00:27:00,420
which you want to master that you want

00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,570
to be resourceful and that's that's good

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,640
yeah

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,590
thank you thank you if I have to say

00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,920
that I'm gonna say you said knowledge

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:13,540
but when I say specific knowledge God's

00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:15,040
America yes that's what I was going for

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,900
reading it's so specific when I say

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,690
about specific I want to be the source

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,270
of knowledge how can I get that I'll be

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,160
doing by reading talking to intelligent

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,809
people trying to put myself there where

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,210
there are more intelligent people or

00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:31,690
subject matter experts that level

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:34,540
specific specific city do get what do

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,910
you get where I'm going at it has to be

00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,010
like very sharp you'd only need to know

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,320
to get it once and that's why because

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:45,550
content is so wide and strategy is so

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,820
specific with what exactly what is why

00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,500
most people rarely fumble and it is a

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,059
fumbling exercise and that's why you

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,130
gotta make mistakes which is absolutely

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:58,390
okay it's a trial and error thing and

00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:00,309
you know though ironic part once you

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,480
think that you've done it the industry's

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:03,039
got is so dynamic

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,279
it's gonna bring something else on your

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:12,880
face so it's reading is the best way to

00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:14,230
be you know be there at the industries

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,730
there are people in the industry when

00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,269
you look up to you not even look up to

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,799
you're there you up yours with them so

00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:22,750
yeah that was one if I want to be a

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,279
source of information and one people do

00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,580
like respect me and all the reading will

00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:30,460
be at if I want to be source of

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:32,169
influence IV I'll put myself more into

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,320
places like these where I get to talk

00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:38,230
about stuff that I know bit and have

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,720
more people interact so this level

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:44,019
specificity is very important and if you

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:48,639
don't really want to know what exactly

00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:51,130
is content strategy a B and C is a

00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:54,730
product B is how you're going to make

00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:58,690
sure that you reach C that's it one

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,860
thing I want you after this session is

00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,809
have more questions

00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,100
I mean if I'll consider this session to

00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:06,039
be a success if you have more questions

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,710
because content strategy is so huge and

00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:13,480
specific all at the same time it makes

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:15,460
you a bit confusing so yeah offline is

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,820
also funded by the way yeah everything

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,919
is funding and yes oh if I haven't

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,860
confused you enough if you want to go

00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,200
learn about who's doing the best micah

00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:29,380
is one of the brands who has done really

00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,559
good and they actually got they made a

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,809
lot of money with e-commerce using

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,230
content strategy when it comes to videos

00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:42,549
which I said people can easily change

00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:45,100
numbers or it spice new ads will spice

00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:47,049
videos have done really well and have

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,179
spot article on how to develop content

00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,850
strategy is something you can go back to

00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:54,190
it slowly in depth a lot of things that

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:57,490
can help you it also tells you how to do

00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:00,539
videos and come up with titles for blog

00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:07,470
post and yeah that's it

00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:07,470
any questions yes

00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:16,590
hi I heard query you were so Bing of

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:19,179
content strategists how do you keep a

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:21,220
personalization of user in mind when you

00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,860
form content strategy for your blog or

00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,130
contact so how it will be useful for

00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:29,559
actual readers and so I have another

00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,649
question for you is it for is it for

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:34,929
personal or is it for brand any well so

00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:36,820
I'm just considering blog right now so

00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:38,649
that can be informative blog that can be

00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,850
personal blog or that can be for so

00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:41,919
sorry to again ask you another question

00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,450
it's very important that when you think

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,860
about strategy who you are writing for

00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,110
and as we said the question the answer

00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,260
is in the question itself how do you

00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:52,630
think about write of writers demography

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:57,279
basically write how to connect with them

00:30:52,630 --> 00:31:01,649
using the age age and their level of

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:04,899
thinking and everything right yes yes so

00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:06,850
you really need to read you really need

00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:08,799
to read and connect them on social media

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,899
because I think social media is the best

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,700
way to interact with them and when you

00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:15,100
have conversations with them I think

00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,899
that works best so I use Twitter a lot I

00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,020
try to connect with people who show

00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:22,270
interest in what I write so if you're

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:27,880
thinking that you're gonna change your

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:31,840
writing for them it might not work you

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:34,360
need to write with what you're good at

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,360
so maybe it's 16 year olds I'm writing

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,520
for okay let's let's change the article

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,230
I'm a 30 year old if I'm writing for 30

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,200
euros I won't be writing on technology

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:47,620
even though gaming is really huge right

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,450
now I know people in 30 age group gaming

00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,159
is huge and it's gonna blow out of

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,120
proportion in few years I know but

00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,279
that's not my strength

00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:59,760
I know there are 30 year olds who are

00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:03,490
also interested in reading drawing art

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,710
so I'll focus on that bet and then I'll

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,010
go to social media I can I'll go to all

00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:11,470
those groups and then I try to have a

00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,720
conversation I try to be a moderator of

00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,690
a community so that way I'll have a lot

00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,809
of more people around lot more photo for

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,529
ideation ask them what works what

00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:22,520
they're looking for

00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:24,620
and trust me you'll be like you'll have

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:28,250
so many ideas you will you can't keep

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:32,330
you can't keep up with those ideas yeah

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:34,310
any more questions okay if you are shy

00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,780

00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,950
session you can ask me a question so
