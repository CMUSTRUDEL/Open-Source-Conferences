okay is it audible so the topic is three

00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,599
growth hacks to market your WordPress

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,439
plugins however I would like to mention

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,860
it it also applies to people who develop

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,800
themes or sell services so just because

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,260
the title suggests it is for plugins I

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,269
mean it doesn't mean that the rest of it

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,519
were not developing plugins the lessons

00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:46,260
do not apply to them the reason I

00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,910
mentioned plugins was because maybe I

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,960
thought the chances of getting selected

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,210
has a speaker would increase because I

00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:02,129
see I mean more developers come toward

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:05,430
cancer so talking about like giving a

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:10,039
brief intro for me I started blogging

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:13,710
when I was 16 and today I turned 22 and

00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:17,190
what I feel WordPress has been like the

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,740
booster for my career if I never came

00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,930
across WordPress I would never know how

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,869
to not leave home and still keep making

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,420
money

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:29,939
I'm the host of Rohan's hobby TV so

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,220
Rohan choppy TV I mean it's my own

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,189
youtube channel which I plan to convert

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,369
into an OTT which is over the top

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,860
television channel for startups so for

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,560
the pilot one I'm trying to grow a

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,930
YouTube channel and within a year we

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,729
plan to start an OTT channel for

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:53,159
startups i co-founded international

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,040
growth hacking day with 35 cofounders

00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,299
from nine countries and it was endorsed

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,350
by the CEO and director of nithi Iowa

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,810
mint of India and I also wrote a book

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:09,119
the growth hacking book which became a

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,769
best-seller in seven countries so it is

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,060
safe to call it an international

00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:17,850
bestseller audience calm which is IBM

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,100
and Twitter's partner product ranks me

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,579
has India's most followed growth hacker

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,180
and the only thing that I have startups

00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:28,700
with is to get their first hundred

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,050
thousand ten thousand or one hundred

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,930
users or customers because I listened to

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,910
the via the the speaker just right

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,530
before this so I would like to mention

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:45,739
that I guess peppy post is net course

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,340
product I guess so I was once called to

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:51,920
net Cole's office to ask how they can

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,959
increase the user base for peppy pose so

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,799
which makes me believe that I have like

00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,950
reached far better companies some of

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:04,660
them are our new UNESCO uber Red Bull

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:08,930
Kalyan jewelers fresh works and others

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:11,090
so when I say growth hacking the common

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,630
question that I get is what is growth

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,510
hacking so from my book the definition

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:21,290
that I subscribed to is growth hacking

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,650
is conducting marketing experiments to

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:28,670
uncover strategies to help you attract

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,920
and retain users however I do not get

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,859
too religious about my own definition I

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:38,920
keep it open for other people to define

00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:38,920
what they want the growth hacking to be

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,120
so I coined the term called growth set

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,940
and we word marked it or trademarked

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,090
whatever you call it so a lot of people

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,709
also ask if you learn growth hacking and

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,350
you become growth hackers or how do you

00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,040
become growth occur the simplest answer

00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,810
to that is work on your growth set i

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,319
define growth higher growth set with a

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:13,389
mathematical formula which is growth set

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:16,280
equals skill set mindset and toolset and

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:19,419
growth hackers operate at the

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:23,210
intersection of marketing technology and

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:25,610
product so what i mean by marketing is

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:29,120
the inbound and outbound marketing

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,729
strategies that you use to maybe attract

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,180
traffic to your website or gain users

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:38,930
whatever your intent is with product I

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,240
mean the the hacks that you do or

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,169
implement at the product level

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,410
it can be copywriting referral marketing

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:51,259
affiliates or the UI and UX I mean

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,889
working on your UI and UX or gamifying

00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:59,750
your app or website or whatever product

00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:02,930
you have built the next is technology by

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,419
technology I mean so growth hackers do

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,430
not have to be coders it is good if you

00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,160
are a coder but if you're not from a

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,289
technical background only if you can um

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,479
I mean if you can write pseudo codes and

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:17,419
someone else in some developer can

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,009
implement your pseudo code for you still

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,770
you will be considered as a growth

00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:25,340
hacker so programming is not a necessity

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:29,150
to become a growth hacker what I mean by

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,069
skillset mindset and tools it is so

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,840
before the stock the VR gave a very good

00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:39,259
example of not example analogy of roots

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,569
and water if you put pour in more or

00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,060
less he gave also give an example if you

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:46,250
pour in more money and see results you

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,520
keep on putting money in your marketing

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,949
and you get used to the paid advertising

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:56,000
however if you stop burning cash and

00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:58,159
find organic ways to grow you will you

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,870
know end up being creative so I feel

00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:02,300
that's what growth hacking is and that

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,570
was a very excellent analogy that he

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,810
suggested that is that is the right

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,030
mindset of growth hacker should have so

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,280
maybe officially be I wouldn't call

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,199
himself a growth hacker but the mindset

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,560
that he suggested is exactly what we

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,380
need by toolsets

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,560
I mean to suggest the tools and methods

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:28,340
that you will use to scale your business

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,969
and skill setters what skills you would

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,909
use to grow your business

00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:37,789
so for let's say for developers or

00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:40,130
WordPress plug-in developers I feel

00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:44,719
there are major four channels that they

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:46,520
get traction from is SEO so this can

00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:49,729
either include listing there are plugins

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,389
on certain websites or writing content

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:55,100
for it and then ranking for it the next

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:59,030
would be social media

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:01,210
or WordPress repository you listing your

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:06,320
plugin in the WordPress repository and

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:09,110
lastly affiliate now in this talk we are

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,930
going to explore the same channels but

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,260
with our different twist so I wouldn't

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,180
go in depth with a lot of hacks let's

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,670
keep it to three so that you are able to

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,650
retain the information and you are able

00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,720
to take a nice take away I mean you get

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,330
a nice take away from this top so we

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:31,120
I've limited it to three but hopefully

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:33,860
it should provide you enough value so

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
this gentleman in the front row had a

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,290
very good I don't remember

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,710
can you please new your name Nero so

00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,360
this Nero sir had a very good talk so I

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,190
was searching what can Mumbai before

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,710
coming your just to see you know how

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,250
other speakers have presented before

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:58,460
this he had a very good talk I guess in

00:07:51,250 --> 00:08:00,320
2016 17 about see selling products in

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,060
which you mentioned just because you can

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,820
build it doesn't mean you have to build

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,800
it so so in case someone has not watched

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,320
that alright highly recommend to watch

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,430
near AUVs or WordPress talk word camp

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:17,690
talk sorry so what so maybe there are a

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,970
lot of how many are developers here so

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,590
how many are theme developers and how

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,610
many are plugins so let's raise hands

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:29,390
for plugins ok quite a few how many

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,690
develop themes okay and how many do you

00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,860
have

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:36,410
I mean how many have services to sell

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,950
okay so this applies to everyone almost

00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:42,979
everyone in the crowd so talking about

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,990
WordPress plugins just because you can

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,080
build it doesn't mean that you have to

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,880
build it you have to analyze and see if

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,240
there is an actual need for what you

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,510
want to build the next is cater to your

00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,710
community so last year I created a SAS

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:03,710
product for Twitter and I saw there was

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,860
a demand for a product like that so it

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,840
used to make tweets go viral and that's

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,780
how that's how I also got into touch

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,280
with a lot of political clients like BJP

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,530
and Congress to you know make their

00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,960
tweets viral through my platform so I

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:21,560
saw there was a need for a product that

00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,290
made tweets go viral and and I built it

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,960
so maybe you know you don't have to have

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,970
10,000 or 20,000 people demanding a

00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,940
product like that maybe you will have

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,190
only thousand or 2,000 people wanting to

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,350
have the product you can still build it

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:41,810
for them so my product acquired about

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,640
1200 customers in 3 months and that was

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,300
enough for us to break even and make

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:50,840
good amount of profits so the first step

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,870
I think we can summarize own online

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:57,650
businesses into just three steps the

00:09:53,870 --> 00:10:01,160
first is build a community the second is

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:04,970
provide value and third is charge for

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,430
the value that you provide but however

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,010
some people tend to skip the first step

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,570
and move on to the second one that is

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,660
building products and services right

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:18,650
away without having a community that

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,720
will back you so so community building

00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,480
is something that you cannot skip at all

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,090
maybe you know you are a developer and

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,300
you may feel engaging with your

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:32,390
community is not good investment for

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,790
your time or but but I feel that

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,040
building a community makes it a lot more

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:42,350
easier for you to sell anything that you

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,780
build the next is see if the plugin

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,820
already exists the kind of idea that you

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,480
have someone might have already built it

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,950
and maybe if their it already exists I

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,070
mean if it does not exist you can always

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:58,190
create it if it is already made you can

00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,830
implement a new change to it and you

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,420
know release your own version of it but

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,670
it shouldn't happen that the other

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,560
plugin which already exists just makes

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,430
one updates and your product does is no

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,440
longer relevant

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,720
so you have to make sure how you can

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,640
future-proof your product as well which

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,910
again you know it is taken from near of

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,910
stock

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,780
the only prerequisite like I said is to

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,060
build so I've written plugins on the

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,810
slide but I want what I mean to say is

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,360
build products so valuable that our

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,710
prospects have no choice but to buy from

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,810
you so you build build when there is a

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:42,370
real need for it and you wouldn't have

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,940
to really sell it because I'm a growth

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,580
hacker

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:49,360
I love funnels so we will see three

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,620
hacks at each stage of the three funnel

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,250
stages that I've mentioned in this

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,440
diagram acquisition activation and

00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,420
retention we will see one hack from each

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:04,390
stage so I do not have a lot more going

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,370
on the slides but you might want to

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,410
carefully listen to what I'm saying

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,220
so and maybe take notes if you think

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,670
that is relevant

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,790
so the first tack is add from the

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:18,190
acquisition stage the acquisition stage

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,200
means to where you're attracting traffic

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,660
to your website or wherever you have

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,430
listed your plug-in if not your plug in

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,500
your theme and if not your theme your

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,360
services so maybe have listed your

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,780
services on your website or maybe you've

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,790
listed your theme on your website so how

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:38,440
do you get traffic and a traffic and

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:41,290
attention to your plug-in I call this

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,560
strategy lead magnet redistribution so

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:47,020
few days ago I was looking for a

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,900
learning management system plug-in LMS

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,360
plugin so learning management system is

00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,020
nothing like you trying to create a

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,900
udemy on your own website so maybe you

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,610
know all of you are aware of udemy so if

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,620
you want to create a udemy like

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,000
structure on your own website you can

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,860
use an LMS plug-in so before buying the

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,440
plug-in from so there are maybe you know

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,700
major five vendors and before buying I

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,740
made the decision based of a blog post

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,440
so maybe if this and then that blog post

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,340
has another lead magnet to a capture my

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,490
email so I based my decision be reading

00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,520
content so even though you are developer

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,590
you may want to have a blog or

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,820
something very which can educate your

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,400
potential buyers

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,900
if you cannot write maybe try hiring

00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,730
content writers so so making I mean

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,210
producing content is the number one

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:50,110
strategy to sell sell anything I'm sure

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:51,490
most of you would agree and I I say lead

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,920
magnet distribution

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,470
specifically I suggest doing this on

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,360
LinkedIn because that's the only social

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,430
media right now which gives you maximum

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,980
traction so the only two social media I

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,800
can think of for you to reach maximum

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,150
people right now is LinkedIn and TED

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,010
Talks of course tik-tok is not a

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:13,180
platform you will sell WordPress plugins

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:16,390
so LinkedIn is the best channel for you

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,180
to utilize right now so now you must be

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,970
wondering how do I reach out or reach to

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,330
my potential buyers on LinkedIn one hack

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:28,360
is you either you know so most of the

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,710
bloggers and company owners mostly you

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,900
know small most small to medium

00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,580
businesses would have a website on

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,770
WordPress so you can directly reach out

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,910
to them by the search option on LinkedIn

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:43,600
another good hack to definitely find

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,990
WordPress users on LinkedIn is to get

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,620
LinkedIn sales navigator in the sales

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,080
navigator you can add a filter for

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,570
seeing what technologies the companies

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:59,110
are using and in there you can write

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:02,740
WordPress so if you input WordPress in

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,750
LinkedIn sales navigators filter you

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,360
will be able to get an extensive list of

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:11,020
companies and people who have their

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,200
websites on WordPress so so imagine if

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,360
you can get the data I mean if you get

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,830
people on LinkedIn you know that they

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,050
are going to use they are using

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,480
WordPress because it shows it in the

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,160
filters so you can be you can reach out

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,840
to them confidently because you know

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,260
they are having their websites on

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,540
WordPress so this is one hack so before

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,490
you try the hack number one that is Ling

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,010
lead magnet free distribution on

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,530
LinkedIn I suggest you connect to has

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:43,930
many users as possible on LinkedIn who

00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:44,410
are using what Howard press uses so what

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,389
do you do

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,550
with the lead magnet so the lead magnet

00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,290
is anything like a free resource that

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,379
you want to give to people to educate

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:57,100
about your plug-in or service or theme

00:15:53,379 --> 00:16:00,160
or whatever the product is and then you

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,529
ask them for their email address or

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,240
phone number to give it to them so there

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,970
was a company that I was working with a

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,350
new york-based company who wanted their

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:13,300
first ha first 1,000 beta users and what

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,000
I did for them is we created a lead

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,430
magnet and I publish it on my LinkedIn

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,629
profile and I simply asked people to

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:24,970
comment yes if they wanted to get it and

00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,949
I just posted the update I went to sleep

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,620
the next day I wake up what I see is it

00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:32,800
already had three lakh 30,000 views and

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,959
thousand plus comments and all of them

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,899
are saying yes so these were like the

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,139
potential beta uses this company wanted

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:44,050
and I couldn't imagine how it cannot

00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:46,029
become more than this you posting an

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,209
update and then next 2000 people asking

00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:51,220
you for what you were selling so so I

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,259
guess the best way to reach out to your

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,240
people right now if you are considering

00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:58,600
to be social media has a channel is

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,300
linked in and do this use this strategy

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,130
create a lead magnet ask them to provide

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,579
your email address or phone number and

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:09,339
give it to them a once they provide it

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:11,140
now you may wonder that okay once the

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,990
lead magnet is created it is shared on

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,299
your profile maybe your post did not go

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,780
viral has mine maybe you instead of

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:22,439
getting thousand leads you got only 100

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,970
how do you reach out to more people so

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,130
another potential strategy that you can

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,770
use this instead of wasting your lead

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,240
magnet by not sharing it further so once

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,850
you have already stated on your profile

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,919
doesn't mean that you can't share it on

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:40,030
other channels or on other people's

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,100
profiles so the other hack could be you

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,990
partnering with other influencers and

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,840
asking them to share the exact same lead

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,900
magnet on their profile so let's say me

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,549
and Raghav windrow have I have 20,000

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,429
followers on LinkedIn Ragavendra may

00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:57,039
have 10,000 and we have an overlapping

00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:57,820
network of 100 or 200 mutual friends

00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,560
but the

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,510
StuffIt from the thousand and two

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,930
thousand connections that we have are

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,910
still not exposed to this lead magnet so

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:09,730
once i've posted this lead magnet on my

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,370
profile and i've got hundred leads I can

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,700
ox Ragavendra to do post it on his

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:18,190
profile and maybe from his profile I'll

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,200
get more 50 leads then I'll go to from

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,140
rabouin relax my are the friend sort of

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,120
to post it then I'll get more 250

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,730
hundred leads from there so you can keep

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,370
asking in Lindon influencers to post the

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,070
exact same lead magnet and keep

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,770
collecting leads so though so your cost

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,110
of developing I mean cost of writing or

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:41,080
creating a lead magnet is just one time

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:44,710
but you can keep redistributed it again

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,750
and again and again so so that is one so

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,560
that is why I call it should the hack is

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,690
called lead magnet redistribution now

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,780
you must be wondering why would your

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,810
friends share your I mean why would your

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,400
friends help you get the leads so

00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:03,160
anyways the plugins and themes and all

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,340
of that have these affiliate model so

00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,620
what can it so maybe your friends would

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,300
question you what is in it for me so you

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,760
can tell them that you can potentially

00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,130
the first thing is you get virality on

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,680
your post so if you are sharing early

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,290
valuable lead magnet anyways the post is

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,870
going to get a lot of traction so you

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,630
are getting viral content for free from

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,600
me the second is whatever leads you get

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,300
and they convert you you make you know X

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,590
percentage of profit so so you can

00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,650
always work with your friends on

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:40,960
affiliate model if they feel they have

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:44,280
real influence on the platform the next

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,420
hack is leverage psychological

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,060
psychology hacks to supercharge your

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,820
plug-in sales so before I move on to the

00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:54,730
second one I forgot to tell you why

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:58,180
Lincoln's algorithm favors organic reach

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,980
so in 2017 like I said my posts were

00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:04,570
getting insanely high amount of views

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:07,120
that was because the algorithm was based

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:10,390
on the Matthew effect the Matthew effect

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,300
means the the rich people keep becoming

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,460
more richer

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,040
and the poor people keep becoming more

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,600
poor I don't know if that is the word so

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,400
what happens is the people who were

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,650
getting more engagement on Linden are

00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,810
shown on the top of the field and the

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,910
people who get less engagement are

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,250
buried inside the Freak I mean are lower

00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:32,390
in the field so this created the

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:35,150
disparity and talked 1% of the platform

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:38,210
I mean top 1% of LinkedIn users got all

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:40,970
the engagement and views and the rest 99

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,040
was starving for engagement and views so

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,230
Linden came up with another recent

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,230
algorithm that I mean they also had an

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,870
update in 2018 then they recently had an

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:54,890
update in June 2019 and the latest

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:57,230
algorithm says this the posts are ranked

00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,200
based on two factors two variables the

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,120
first is people you know that means the

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,430
people you are connected to and the

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,160
second is things you care about so let's

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,440
say if I care about WordPress I would be

00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,170
I would I'm more likely to see WordPress

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,700
related updates in my feed on the top so

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,470
let's see if you are my connection and

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,780
you and you post something related to

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,970
the WordPress and I'm following a

00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,430
hashtag WordPress or a group WordPress

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,080
so LinkedIn is more likely to show me an

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:26,690
update from you because you're in my

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,940
connection so the two variables are the

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,910
people you know and the things you care

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,670
about and that's why Linden suggests to

00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,980
only post update which are very specific

00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:39,380
so let's say if you're a web WordPress

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,450
developer or you're providing services

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,030
related to WordPress you want to make

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,310
sure that you keeps talking about just

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,680
WordPress to create the community around

00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,390
the same topic the second what they

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,660
suggest so this is coming from the

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,970
engineers of LinkedIn the next tip they

00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,370
suggest is mentioning five people in all

00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,860
your updates and asking them who are

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,930
more likely to engage in the discussion

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,090
so if if I'm posting a lead magnet or

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,800
just normal update how I created my

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,800
plug-in and how it can be useful for

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,960
your business tag five people who are

00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,240
more likely to hop in the comment

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,940
section and tell something and start a

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,250
conversation and next if there is

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,410
suggest is to use three hash tags not

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,330
more than that so I'm not sure what's

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,220
the logic behind this but this is coming

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:33,080
from LinkedIn engineers so I will follow

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:37,460
Langly and the last algorithm factor is

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:39,409
the favor updates that encourage

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,840
conversations so if you have a regular

00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:43,820
to-and-fro going on in your comment

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,640
sections your bits are more likely to

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:50,900
rank higher in the feed the next is

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,510
psychology hacks to supercharge your

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,340
plug-in sales so I just had only one

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,860
hack but there is a mistake that I wrote

00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,620
hacks so the one psychology hack that I

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,679
always use with my services or if you

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,510
have plugins so let's say let's

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:10,039
understand with an example so let's say

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:13,309
if I want to sell my book I would charge

00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:15,200
it maybe you know 450 for the book the

00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:17,450
next pricing option I would have with

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,330
the book you can get be my you know

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,549
whatsapp community where I share growth

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,250
hat every day a new growth hack every

00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:27,490
day plus you get access to a master

00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,049
class to get your first 100 customers

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,140
organically even when nobody knows you

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:36,620
so these three you get four so let's say

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:39,590
you get the book for $25 the option B is

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,570
$35 where you get the book the access to

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,090
the community and access to masterclass

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:47,330
for 35 so there is a price difference of

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,159
$10 and the third pricing option would

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,350
be you get the book you get the

00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:53,630
community you get the master class plus

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,900
one addition is you get a four page

00:23:53,630 --> 00:24:00,440
guide for growth hacking which is now

00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:02,210
$65 so you will so when you analyze the

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,120
option be an option see there is only

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,919
one difference in option B I'm selling

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,289
the book community and masterclass for

00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,630
dollar thirty-five and an option C and

00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:14,809
selling book community + masterclass +

00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:17,780
four page guide for dollar 65 so you're

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:19,669
more likely to pick dollar 35 option

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,520
because it's cheaper than the third

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:24,380
option and having more value and you're

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,080
going to drop option number one which

00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,120
was just booked for third $25 because

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,150
when you compare that with B it is

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,280
ridiculous I mean book for 25 and then

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,190
option B was book community and

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,269
masterclass for $35 so young I know that

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,149
your more lies like

00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:43,759
to pick the dollar 35 so you can price

00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:46,399
your plugins like that so you make

00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:49,549
customers pick the pricing options that

00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:51,769
you want them to pick so this is called

00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:53,989
decoy effect you can always google

00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:57,559
search and find more about it or you can

00:24:53,989 --> 00:25:00,889
go to my Korra profile I've shared more

00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:03,320
than I guess hundred psychology hats

00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:07,940
that you can employ for your business so

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:10,399
this is just one of those hundred the

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,519
last is price your plugin like a SAS

00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:16,279
company so I've seen a lot of plug-in

00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,139
sellers or service vendors if you are

00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:20,450
selling marketing services or WordPress

00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:23,389
related services or if you're selling

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:26,200
themes a lot of people have these

00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:28,429
one-time charges and then they forget to

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,109
remind their customers or they do not

00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:32,749
have something that customers would keep

00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:34,369
coming back so I suggest even though

00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:36,739
your developer I think like a marketer

00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:39,049
and price your plug-in like a SAS

00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:41,089
company so what a SAS company does is it

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:43,820
keeps charging you on a monthly

00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:45,979
recurring model and and that is why I

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,320
that is what I think all the plugins

00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:51,349
should be charged in a similar fashion

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,299
so maybe I was talking to some one of

00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:57,829
the sponsors outside and they said their

00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:59,899
plug-in is about 149 dollars per year I

00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:01,849
think that's a very smart way of

00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:03,409
charging I mean they are exactly

00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:05,929
following this principle of charging

00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:10,129
like a SAS company what I would improve

00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:12,769
in that is I'll make it monthly why I

00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:15,019
say that is because then you get to see

00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:17,749
your monthly recurring revenue I mean

00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:20,419
not that you have to care about it but

00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:22,070
what happens is let's say so there are

00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:25,759
two ways when you charge people on one

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:28,219
recurring model is if you do not charge

00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,499
people on recurring model you kind of

00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:32,839
lose customers so let's see if I forget

00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:35,299
to renew my subscription which has to be

00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,979
done manually if I buy a plug-in and I

00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:39,259
have to renew my subscription with you

00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:41,389
manually I may forget I may get busy and

00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:44,239
may not come back however if you Auto

00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:46,849
charge me it can happen that I did not

00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:49,669
wanted my car to be auto charge and I

00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:51,259
will make a refund request or I make a

00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:52,010
charge back if I was using my credit

00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:55,910
card

00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:57,559
so to to make sure that this doesn't

00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,000
happen you can remind your users

00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,000
beforehand before you charge them

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,290
automatic that the charges are automatic

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,090
and in next 30 days we are going to

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,520
charge you again so they have an option

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:12,200
to continue I mean keep it as it is or

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,630
cancel so yeah so maybe some people may

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,330
debate that plugins are not SAS products

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,460
and the pricing may not work but I think

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,590
there's a lot of plugins these days come

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,559
with this monthly or yearly recurring

00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:26,510
charges and also plug-in plugins are

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,360
nothing but a software product and

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,460
you're also providing support so that

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,620
becomes a service so essentially I would

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,540
say plugins and I think I mean it is

00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:40,160
safe to say plugins are also software

00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:42,350
has a service SAS products okay so I

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,880
think we ended the presentation lastly

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:49,010
what I want to say you is follow me on

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,220
Twitter that has ruins of a fall for

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:54,770
more growth hacks and I have a gift for

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,140
you so today since it's my birthday I

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,760
have like I was talking about creating

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,490
your own community which is super

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,350
dedicated towards you so I have a very

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,510
small community I'm not famous enough to

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,429
have thousands of people I mean ten tens

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,020
and thousands but I have about you know

00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:10,940
good 500 thousand people who are

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,040
dedicated ly following me everywhere and

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,100
they will just buy anything if I'm

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:20,770
selling so from guru how to mirror road

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:24,260
there are about nine billboards with my

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:26,540
birthday wishes if at all someone says

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,130
between Gauri go to Mira Road and they

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,559
see my billboard it is only one

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,809
kilometer from the station click up with

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,220
children send it to me on Twitter and in

00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:39,570
return I'll send you a gift to your
