hello

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,540
so let me just kind of yeah all right

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:37,950
yes all right

00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:40,650
good so good to see you guys right it's

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,190
always great pleasure to be here

00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,590
feels like home and thanks to all the

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,570
organizers I know how hard it is to put

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,570
up a show like this so thank you and

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:57,120
thank you for coming here it speaks a

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,049
lot about who you are and what your

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,940
commitment is you may not realize that

00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,949
but hopefully in this session you will

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,940
actually realize what is special about

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:13,260
you so I don't want to really do too

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:18,210
much of an introduction the talk is

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:21,780
about dream chasing and I had a lot of

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,720
dreams and one of the decisions that I

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,869
made as in very early in my childhood my

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,380
dad is a chain-smoker

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,460
was a chain smoker and there was this ad

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,600
that I saw in magazines and that read

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,109
basically saying that I will get what I

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,560
want

00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:43,710
and when I used to see that I made two

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,409
decisions in my life one I will never

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,189
smoke and two I will get a boarder I

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,799
will get what I want those two decisions

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,619
have actually driven my life and I've

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,619
always been number one schools I was

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,899
number one whether that is academics

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,210
whether that is co-curricular so I was

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,969
always number one I started my business

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,140
when I was 18 years but I started making

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,330
money when I was 7 7 grade 7 grade eight

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,200
grade 9 grade so I've done a lot of

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,319
things over the past 22 years that have

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:25,530
run the business for and I've seen lots

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:28,920
of success so we will talk about success

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,770
we will talk about failures also but we

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,650
will more specifically talk about

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:37,200
chasing your own dreams so well I'll

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,670
talk about my stories what will really

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,710
make

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,600
this you know whatever 30 minutes

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:46,020
important for you is if you actually

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:50,280
start looking at your life and your

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,080
dreams right I guess your dreams are

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:58,560
more important than my dreams for you at

00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:01,200
least I hope yeah so let's start so

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,140
Story number one this is about three up

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,540
three years ago and you know we're

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,100
chasing targets the business is doing

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,600
well but you know we've launched a lot

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,330
of products a lot of new plugins and

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,000
they are not picking up that well as we

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,700
had anticipated so we are seeing some

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,170
sales but not as much as we want we

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,880
seeing support requests and then you

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,430
know there is a lot of struggle the team

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,290
is small we still are a small team we

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,540
have huge resource crunch things are

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,240
growing and we want to grow but we can't

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,920
grow you know can't find enough talent

00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:36,000
all of that is going on at the same time

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,860
and Karthik has given us like you know a

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,630
1 million dollar cut target like you

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,380
know you go to chase that I'm chasing it

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:47,700
chasing it and not able to make it right

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:50,430
so 1 million looks like the elusive goal

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:57,720
you know sweating it out but not making

00:03:50,430 --> 00:04:00,330
it and there's a lot of struggle now

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,280
while I'm just sitting there struggling

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,590
struggling and almost like giving up and

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,090
trying to come up with some new ideas of

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,650
how can we actually grow from here I

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,050
actually chanced upon something very

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:17,850
interesting and I came up with what I

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:20,820
now call the 10x formula so 10x formula

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,100
was like very simple basically on a

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,150
website if you make sales if you want to

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,150
grow your website if you want to grow

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,860
any business there are three factors one

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,970
is you go get leads you go to get people

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,410
walk into your store that is visitors

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,390
then you go to sell them something at

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,430
that point in time and then you want to

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,340
be able to sell them something again in

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,430
the future so if you double your traffic

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,650
if you double your conversion rate and

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,330
if you triple your RP which is average

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,240
revenue per user that kind of money that

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,870
you make per customer you essentially

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,750
have a dual

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,760
business model right or twilight's ho

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,640
donny upon throwed up like rounded out

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,860
so that's why it's called Tenex but if

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,310
you apply this strategy your business

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,890
can definitely go 10x now that was a

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,290
great strategy it did work for us also

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,200
but what is really interesting to learn

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,720
here is that whenever you are facing a

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,570
complex problem if you apply your

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,470
scientific mind and break it down into

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:26,370
smaller pieces and then deal with each

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:29,850
one it individual level you will have a

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,890
much higher chance of success so instead

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,720
of going at like okay let's do 1 million

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,520
dollars as a revenue target right we

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,030
said okay so let's keep it aside we'll

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,840
get there but can we do 2x traffic can

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,250
we do 2x conversion can we do 3x ARPU

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,870
right and we made improvements in each

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,330
of that we've still not hit 1 million

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,880
but you know we've come a long way

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,240
the real lesson is break it down into

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,650
smaller pieces so that you can chew it

00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:01,200
okay so 10x kept on happening like that

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,530
you know scientific method of you know

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,750
applying your applying scientific method

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,990
to your problems does always work and

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,870
you know we've seen that work but along

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:17,070
with that the other thing that I

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:21,030
realized is that you know that need of

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:24,560
always winning right that I always want

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:27,300
to win I always want to be number one so

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,610
before I want to give you an answer to

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,010
that but before let's do this that what

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,470
is keeping us from achieving our dreams

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,060
because I'll give you my answers but

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,550
what's really important is about your

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,780
dream so what do you think what keeps

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:45,690
you away from achieving your dreams I

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:48,990
think the first thing is very simple we

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:53,310
always ask what do I need to do to

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:58,170
achieve my goal what we should really be

00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:01,580
asking is who do I need to be to achieve

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,439
my goal and there is a subtle difference

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,879
right

00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:10,309
so doing is important but being is more

00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,869
important you got to understand that

00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:15,379
what kind of a person you'll have to

00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:16,849
become to take those actions because

00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:20,179
your being comes before your actions

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:22,309
right so I won't go much into the

00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:24,739
details but basically ask your question

00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:27,499
ask yourself this question that who do I

00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:29,809
need to be to achieve that goal what

00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:33,080
kind of a person do I need to be because

00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:39,649
the actions will automatically happen so

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:43,699
next if you aren't better work harder do

00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:47,239
we want to succeed but we may not be

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,009
good at certain things like we may not

00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,899
be good at coding somebody else may be

00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,860
better at that than us then what do we

00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:57,979
do we work harder because in a no

00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,909
company can keep you around just for

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:04,579
showing up they'll keep you around and

00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,279
they'll actually be happy for you and

00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:10,129
give you growth if you are growing them

00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,569
if if you contributing to the business

00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,939
growth you're taking care of customers

00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:19,819
there is no problem that they will have

00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:21,439
to give you growth so work harder if you

00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,529
are not better but get better if you

00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,819
work harder you go get better and it's

00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,669
required in today's days it's really

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:32,240
important so you want to know the truth

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,500
about being number one how many of you

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,110
actually want to be number one like

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:43,279
maybe the or one out but like oh there

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:45,649
are some more or ones yeah so do you

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,550
want to hear like the truth of our being

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:54,860
number one anybody yeah you won't hear

00:08:49,550 --> 00:09:00,290
that yes okay so the truth the real

00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:03,490
truth about being number one is that

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,490
it's okay to be number two also

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,790
yeah it really doesn't matter that much

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,079
we struggle so much to be number one

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,180
that even when we are number two number

00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:20,170
three number four number ten we like

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,720
kill ourselves

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,690
already number one Eva IRA made to

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,769
number ten B Hannah there is a

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,959
statistics that in golf

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:36,579
the difference between the number one

00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:39,550
golfer and the tenth player is just one

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:41,560
point nine shots like you know you have

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,899
to take shots in golf and then it's just

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,300
like let's say two shots so the number

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:49,630
one player reads they're two shots

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,660
before the number tenth player the money

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:58,089
that they make is vastly different it's

00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:02,310
not just two shots so yes if you are

00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:05,470
number one you do get a lot more reward

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:09,010
but really it's okay to be number two

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:11,620
it's okay to be number three because

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:16,000
what's really important is for you to be

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,800
there in the game if you're not number

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,120
one and if you quit the game or if

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,560
you're number ten in if you quit the

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,880
game are you ever going to be number one

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,279
if you stay in the game there is a

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,170
chance for you to be number one if you

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,750
go out of the game there is no chance

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:36,420
right so that is the real truth about

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:39,790
being number one so Story number two and

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,800
you know I don't know how many of you

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:46,060
know but I call myself an entrepreneur

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,130
geek because I'm geek first entrepreneur

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,069
later but entrepreneur is more important

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:54,550
that pays the bills author becomes first

00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:58,029
but I love coding and I love solving

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,980
problems so we have this plugin called

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,990
ice gram and another solution called

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,040
portala and for which we wanted to build

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,449
a little solution so essentially what we

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,170
wanted to do was we wanted to take this

00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:14,440
kind of input of user data that if we

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,779
have an email address or if we have

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,970
phone number if we have the address of

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,750
the person we were all kind of clean it

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,810
up

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,910
validated right normalize it and

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,260
enriched it what does that mean so if

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,910
somebody is given a bad email address

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,440
and because you know we have a email

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,180
subscription email marketing plug-in

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,740
whenever somebody subscribes we want to

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,820
make sure that it's not a fake email we

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,290
want to make sure that it's a clean

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,370
email if somebody's saying

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,420
need of +1 2 3 at gmail.com we want to

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,090
normalize that don't need about

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,330
gmail.com because it's all the same and

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,860
stuff like that and for our commerce

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,720
plugins we want to kind of normalize the

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,240
address also whatever address people

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:58,960
have entered in we need to convert that

00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:01,360
into a format that we can query on if

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,940
you had to solve this problem what do

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,290
you think how hard this problem would be

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,190
how many days will it take you kind of

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:13,330
solve this and he takes developers

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:15,190
started lovers the plenty of ace

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,670
developers in the crowd so if you had to

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:23,070
kind of do this much how much time will

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,070
it take you guesses

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,040
I won't hire you if you say one week I

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,490
won't hire you if you say one year

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:38,440
either

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:42,490
but anything no too hard a problem to

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:48,910
crack no - like it's just a matter of

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:52,660
few hours maybe no six to seven hours

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:57,160
very good okay maybe less yes any

00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:01,360
anybody else four hours

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:05,760
nice I'm getting some candidates anybody

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,760
else all right

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:15,780
go Google fall suits programmers believe

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:18,910
okay anybody who's into programming go

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:22,780
do this you know and it's gonna give you

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:27,430
a list of things that we believe to be

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:30,100
true but are not okay like for email

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:34,410
validation if you did anything other

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,970
than at the rate it's going to be wrong

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,220
because people can have email addresses

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,270
I mean the RFC spec allows email

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:47,530
addresses of all sorts if you think that

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,570
when people had to okay let me just go

00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:54,540
back go back

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:54,540
I'll be back no where are we

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:03,850
okay good so for example if you think

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,680
that people will enter addresses

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,510
properly that's wrong if you think

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,810
people will always enter California

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:13,480
instead of CA I mean people will enter

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,579
CA people will enter California now you

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,100
live in make that conditional okay I'm

00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:20,110
smart you know California or CA I'll

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,290
validate both of them I will convert

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,930
both of them into CA state what if they

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,660
make a spelling mistake now what do you

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,839
do okay

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,160
oh I'll give them a drop down but what

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,820
if they are coming from a country that

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,010
doesn't understand English then right so

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,079
there are tons of things that make this

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:46,180
problem hard and but one can argue that

00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,459
okay we can just use Google api's and

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,050
let Google do all this work can you know

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:52,899
we can just use their mapping API isn't

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,540
convert an address to a long led that is

00:14:52,899 --> 00:15:00,130
what we want but what if you want to do

00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,420
this for a free plugin okay somebody

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,620
will come and argue that okay don't do

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,450
it for a free plugin you're gonna burn

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,089
the money right that's not a good

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,399
business model all right fine

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:12,779
even if I'm charging what if I want to

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:16,720
do it for millions of Records every day

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:18,880
now that's the problem we have okay we

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,620
we have a free plugin for which we want

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,940
to do this and we have a business

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,829
analytic service which processes

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,260
millions of transactions per day for

00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:29,980
which we need to do this it's a real

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,630
hard problem okay because we cannot use

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,270
a third party API even like Google

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:37,810
because it's too expensive right so what

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,720
we had to do and this is life I mean but

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,990
what we had to do was use open source

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,270
systems and kind of work through it and

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,630
find a solution that'll be almost

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,370
real-time this was done in three

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:55,180
millisecond yeah this is three

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:58,000
milliseconds same is the entire thing it

00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,550
takes a lot of data in and processes it

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,990
does a lot of things brought me fooling

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,230
it's not really three milliseconds it's

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,760
actually cached but yeah it does a lot

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,079
of things so it's a hard problem the

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,660
only thing that I want to tell you is

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,160
that it's a hard problem

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:19,230
now heart problems require geniuses to

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,230
solve the problems I solved it

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:27,670
all right that's but you know okay so

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:30,480
how many of you interested in being a

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:34,740
genius or at least being called a genius

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,120
like other people see you as a genius

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,560
Milani Allah Allah but Allah keen like

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:48,040
this really like not take it off genius

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:54,640
oh that's right right so the trick with

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:58,660
being genius first of all innovation is

00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:03,820
nothing but just taking some old ideas

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:05,770
and making new connections right so

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,450
there is something already out there and

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,370
then you're making a new connection

00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,920
that's all there is about innovation

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:17,140
because most of it is innovation and not

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,900
invention and every great idea it's a

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,970
formula I mean it goes through five

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,680
phases the first thing that you have to

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:29,410
do to you know wait or to become genius

00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,820
is to really think hard about the

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,730
problem like you have to really study it

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,890
well so you have to first define your

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,500
problem and then you have to go deep

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,940
into it right you have to study a lot

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,860
you have to you know go through a lot of

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,060
material then what you do is once you've

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,290
done all that studying you know that

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:54,160
second bit is done you know take a break

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:56,670
so you walk away from the problem now

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,910
once you walk away from the problem

00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:03,720
there'll be some time suddenly

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:08,580
especially when you're in the shower

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:11,920
that something will just hit right and

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,930
that's the genius because then you get

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,600
something which is like an epiphany some

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:20,200
new idea that was kind of culmination of

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,210
everything that you did before all you

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,430
have to do now is go back

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,740
you know assess the Ida put it into a

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,180
proper form and the last fifth step is

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,710
remaining is just test it out in the

00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:34,000
world that whether this idea really

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,440
works or not so that's the trick about

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,570
being genius I kind of applied that

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,940
trick to solve this problem that we had

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,350
if anybody is interested in learning how

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,090
we solve this problem you know you can

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,380
meet me afterwards it's it's pretty

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,440
interesting I could do a talk on that

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:50,070
but yeah so that's to talk about being

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,920
genius all right

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:56,290
so genius so Tegan hope yeah

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,780
but we have lots of these tech problems

00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:05,140
right now like you know react and

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:07,320
Gutenberg and content only frameworks

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:12,640
and then headless work WordPress and

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:16,080
whatnot and this is gorgeous grow so how

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:21,730
do you survive all this mess of

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,050
maddening technology so you want to

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:27,460
learn some new technology how many of

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:29,710
you want to learn react nice how many of

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,790
you want to learn something new in the

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:38,980
next six months

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:41,020
yeah you better do right so every time I

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,530
have tried to learn a new technology

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:48,460
I've almost gone nuts okay and I love

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:53,440
technology but what has brought me back

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:58,030
and what has centered me is asking this

00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:01,030
one question I'm guessing you want to

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:04,390
know that question yeah all right so the

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:10,150
question is no matter what technology it

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:13,060
is what's the purpose who are you

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,940
building it for what does your user

00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,220
really want so I may be building the

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,070
fanciest geolocation stuff in the world

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:24,190
okay that like works in so milliseconds

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,820
and that just uses open-source data but

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:30,120
boss

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,120
who wants it how do they want it

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:36,100
that is what is most important because

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,250
you will build a coolness of technology

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:43,580
but if your user doesn't want it what's

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,350
the point yes there is a point you get

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,260
that satisfaction but beyond that what's

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,420
the point

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,040
so anytime you're really going crazy

00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,780
after a new technology you're trying to

00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,820
figure out some react stuff and you know

00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,750
that NPM module and then or whatever

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,550
that new es6 index is driving you crazy

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,990
take a break check off you know whatever

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:08,180
and ask what am I really here for what

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,770
am I trying to solve that problem that

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,510
technical problem that you're trying to

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,890
solve is not really the problem there is

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,990
a business problem there is a user

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,250
problem that you're trying to solve what

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,600
is the problem get in touch with that

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,050
and you will have your solution quickly

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:27,100
all right well that's my method of

00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:30,910
surviving tech chaos the other thing is

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:36,800
distinguishing between studying and

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:38,000
learning so while I'm speaking here and

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,510
I'm giving you a lot of beyond like

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,460
ababa when you'll enjoy it and you'll go

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:49,310
back home I will say how cush gneissic

00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:53,780
nebula all that won't make a difference

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:56,870
at all okay because all you're doing is

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,250
just learning so learning is

00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,010
accumulating knowledge and information

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,430
and all you will have at the end of it

00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:07,670
is knowledge does knowledge make a

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:12,740
difference yes

00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:15,820
all right somewhat ok does knowledge

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,820
alone make a difference

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,490
she gotta have some knowledge but until

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,870
until you put that knowledge to practice

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:29,000
that knowledge is worth nothing yeah

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,860
correct she could turn it into a skill

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,940
you got to turn it into some kind of

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:40,400
practice because a knowledge that is not

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:42,320
invested is a knowledge wasted so if you

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,420
are like listening if you're sitting

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,270
here for all these three days you've got

00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,070
so many new concepts and tomorrow you'll

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,330
go out and then you'll be like a charm

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,920
or Twitter based social media with

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:57,670
rocker dia and that's the end of it

00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,470
sorry I mean you've wasted your time

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,910
right and that's not in that's that was

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,930
never the intention of the organisers

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,600
there was never the intention of

00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,490
WordPress so what really matters is take

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,130
all that knowledge information and put

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,710
it to practice put something to practice

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,750
put one thing to practice then you will

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,410
see some results and then it will be

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,140
worth your time

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,400
right and that that applies to

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,960
everything that applies to react that

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:27,430
applies to a six that applies to

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:31,430
whatever JavaScript whatever okay so yes

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:33,130
part two right you didn't expect that

00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:36,520
you thought there was only one answer so

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:40,070
what keeps us from attaining our dreams

00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:42,500
part two the answer is already on the

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:47,660
screen right I thought I'll forget so

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,430
I'll just put a hint for myself really

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,110
if you think about it what keeps you

00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:57,500
from attaining your goals is your e2e

00:23:54,110 --> 00:24:05,500
ratio your eavers is a ratio what is the

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:09,200
e versus a ratio your entertainment to

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,990
Education ratio how much time do you

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,930
spend on education and how much time do

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,940
you spend on entertainment

00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,920
that ratio my dear friends will

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:24,039
determine the success you will have in

00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:26,019
your life really

00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,049
you may not like me for saying that my

00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:32,590
wife may not like me for saying that but

00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:34,179
that is the truth the top 20% performers

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,220
of the world spend a lot more time

00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:41,590
educating themselves and their teams

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:42,940
then entertaining them so yes do or do

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,860
and the entertainment that you need to

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,750
do but maintain a healthy balance you go

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,789
to spend more time energy effort money

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:56,350
on education then on entertainment

00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:58,570
right just a simple math movie food

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,940
dining out whatever just do the total

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,559
how much money you spend on that how

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,169
much time you spend on that in the last

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,000
one month six month whatever and how

00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:11,289
much time money energy you spend on

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,419
education you know your answer okay you

00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:15,370
won't always tilt it towards education

00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:19,809
then anything else all right

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:22,210
3433 okay so because I talked about

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:27,700
entertainment this story's also linked

00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:29,380
to entertainment so I told you I'm an

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,590
entrepreneur I'm a geek and I'm really a

00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,539
geek beyond technology so you know

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:38,950
recently we've got into games like

00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:40,419
family playing games so you know I was

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,149
going for a conference and we wanted to

00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:47,740
prepare some swags like something to

00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:54,210
gift and I got all crazy and I created a

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:58,799
game okay so we actually built a game

00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,799
okay do you have it in you

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:09,659
so that's that's a game that we created

00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:12,299
and a lot of people loved it I did not

00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:16,500
have enough time to actually make it for

00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:18,929
everybody we have a few only a few it's

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,970
a fun game every time we play with

00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:24,779
family you know people love it

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:26,340
it's called demon and I wanted to give

00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:31,620
it as a feast of swag I told you but

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:34,440
maybe next time so yeah and and my wife

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,299
is questioning me but you have to go to

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,309
us we have to finish all these deadlines

00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:42,389
before going there why are you working

00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:44,039
on this like really like why are you

00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:45,870
spending endless time and nights just

00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:49,289
doing this if nothing else at least

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,669
sleep right I mean don't don't work on

00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:53,039
this till 4 o'clock in the morning and

00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:58,980
and you know next day you have so much

00:26:53,039 --> 00:27:05,279
of other work to do also but that's the

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:07,620
geek right so anyways back to this so we

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:11,190
have a few people my team is here

00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,260
wearing these badges ok gray t-shirts

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,779
and these badges we have three games

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,149
with each at the end of the session you

00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:23,159
know in the tea break you can go find

00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:24,870
them and we can just tell them and I'm

00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,399
making it at runtime is you can just

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,299
tell them what are you going to take

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:33,570
from this three days of work camp and

00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:35,039
practice into your life ok ganma they're

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,940
not my body on there now we don't need

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,850
more games from you so practically a

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,279
guru gave you no tell that to one of my

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:47,690
teammates ok and if they like it they'll

00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:54,240
give you though again make sense

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:56,700
alright ok thank you right so back to

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,620
the story so I'm making all this game

00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,850
and then my family and maybe my team

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,130
also you know they don't tell me on the

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,330
face but I'm sure the question a Kakkar

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,130
I hope or whatever and you know

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,539
expending all this time working on

00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,360
designs in Illustrator and then

00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:11,480
coordinating printing what is because of

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,480
this

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:20,780
achievement is always going to be less

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,430
than fulfillment and fulfillment is

00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,990
always going to be more important than

00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:29,000
achievement so my people's will probably

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,220
become let's say the number one email

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,070
provider so you know email sending

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,340
service provider for people and then be

00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,910
a great achievement for them but what

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:43,040
would be a great satisfaction for them

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:44,630
right so if they'd be a kind of sees

00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,700
that okay that eight billion number is

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:51,560
great but out of those eight billion

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:53,420
emails that they sent out okay if even

00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,660
thousand of those emails made a real

00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,510
difference okay in some people's life it

00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:02,000
it turned that businesses around it made

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,790
some good to the world I think that is

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,010
what will make him happier then all the

00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:10,220
other numbers put together so

00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:15,860
achievement is important fulfillment is

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:18,320
even more important so you really got to

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:23,740
be asking yourself that okay what

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:27,050
fulfills me what is my real passion and

00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:35,420
then do that now that brings me to the

00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:37,940
next slide part three right so question

00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,380
doesn't end what keeps us from attaining

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,100
our goals because we're talking about

00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,100
dream chasing

00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:49,519
see when we talking about dream chasing

00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:51,409
two words in here already and it's

00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,969
loaded already we're talking about a

00:29:51,409 --> 00:30:01,429
dream when you're talking about chasing

00:29:54,969 --> 00:30:06,759
so tell me when does the chase end does

00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:09,200
the chase ever end the chase never ends

00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:13,269
exactly yeah

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,889
it's not even once one dream is over

00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:20,839
it's before that dream is over you have

00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:22,879
another dream most likely for and if

00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,759
you're like me for folks like me once

00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:31,789
your dream is 30% over now we have four

00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:35,209
more dreams okay so what what really

00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:38,149
keeps us from attaining that goal is

00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:41,379
that we are always chasing it and we are

00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:44,649
always thinking about the destination

00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:47,659
we're not thinking about the journey

00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:50,239
we're not thinking about then now we're

00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:53,509
not thinking of the present we're always

00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:55,549
thinking about the future so why that

00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:58,099
game is important for me is because that

00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:03,349
game gives me happiness with my family

00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:05,419
now why that game is important for me is

00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:07,820
because if you play that game with your

00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:10,700
family that's going to give you happy

00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,979
moments right now and more than your

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,669
business those happy moments are more

00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:19,779
important for me okay that's why I do

00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:19,779
those crazy things that I do

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,970
so whenever you're thinking about just

00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:30,660
the destination you're you're doing it

00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:34,650
wrong you go to enjoy the process also

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:36,630
because for example I was talking to a

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,930
friend and he says you know I want to be

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:45,270
free so once I get this this this then

00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:48,300
I'll be free and I asked him alright so

00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:51,120
I get it that you want to be free but if

00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:55,800
you cannot be free now how will you ever

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:59,250
get free then if you cannot get freedom

00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,690
in the moment how in the world are you

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,360
gonna experience freedom at the end of

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,010
it if you cannot be happy in the moment

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:10,800
how in the world are you gonna be happy

00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:12,990
at the end of it right so even if you're

00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,280
just learning a new technology even if

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,170
you're building your first website even

00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,940
if you're taking those baby steps in

00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,810
content marketing what really is

00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,400
important is enjoying the process if you

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,870
do not enjoy the process you'll burn

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,140
yourself out you will never reach the

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,140
goal

00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:33,210
so enjoy the process as much as you

00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:37,620
driven to get to the goal that is

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:40,500
important my friend and mentor told me

00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,940
about a key guy and I just love the

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,240
concept just Google for it you will get

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,070
it but essentially what I get out of it

00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,390
is that you want to be doing things and

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,020
you want to be spending your time and

00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:53,990
energy on this intersection of icky guy

00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,640
where something that you're good at

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,310
something that you love doing something

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,150
that the world needs and something that

00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,920
the world will pay for okay that's the

00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,200
key guy it's a great phenomenal concept

00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,660
I definitely encourage you guys to learn

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,220
more about it obviously you can buy the

00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,590
book but you can get a lot of things

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:19,530
online just by googling for Kika also

00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:27,060
and but I have a twist to that also okay

00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:31,290
and I tell my team in your life see most

00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:34,350
of us actually choose our couriers much

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:35,100
earlier in life right so when you are

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,750
intent

00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,240
to choose the stream you want to go for

00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,630
science commerce whatever you know you

00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:46,980
have to choose your career but early on

00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:50,490
in your life I would say ask yourself

00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:55,320
what kind of a life do you want then

00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:57,240
choose a career okay so in my case for

00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,549
example I was very clear that I do not

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,360
want to travel a lot to go to my

00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:05,760
workplace so I had the privilege I

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,129
always kept my offices 10 minutes

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,530
distance from wherever I was living so I

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,320
could just reach office in 10 minutes

00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:16,260
right if it was raining like it rains in

00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,850
Mumbai I could just walk well that's

00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,570
that's a privilege that I had because I

00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:22,859
was starting my office all right

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,100
obviously you can also do that choice

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:27,510
but what's really important is that you

00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,320
got to be clear about what you want and

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:32,669
then build your life accordingly but

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,070
most of us don't have that choice so

00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,570
what do you do so you are stuck in a

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,460
profession for example if you start

00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,250
working with me you have a hard time

00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,619
right I mean you get to work on a lot of

00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:47,330
interesting problems but you have lots

00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:51,210
of challenges right what do you do and

00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:52,440
there will be moments when you will not

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:58,200
really enjoy the work that you're doing

00:34:52,440 --> 00:35:03,060
I would say again one more truth is that

00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:06,210
80% of it you will not enjoy 80% of your

00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:09,470
work you will not enjoy even if you are

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,470
sitting in the DK position

00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,400
it's the rest it's the rest that's

00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,050
important and you want to be looking

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,110
forward to that so every time you are

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,400
stuck in that 80% piece of you know work

00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,440
that you do not enjoy whether that's

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,840
talking to clients writing that code

00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,820
supporting customers or making that

00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,900
design whenever you start doing that any

00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:35,490
person that you do not enjoy just be

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:39,270
okay do not resist accept it embrace it

00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:42,270
and look forward to the other 20% right

00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:46,740
because your profession is something

00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:49,470
that you chose okay turn it into your

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,180
vocation turn it into your passion so

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,400
turn your profession into a passion if

00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,250
you didn't get the profession that

00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:01,370
you're passionate about get it like if

00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:04,500
you got lemons make lemonade find love

00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,760
discover love in whatever we've got okay

00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,580
don't just keep chasing love you'll

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,850
never get it so if you stuck with a bad

00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,850
job

00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,079
I don't think it's really that bad a job

00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:21,279
really that tons of plenty of good

00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,869
things about it if it's really that bad

00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:26,160
you can change it but really think twice

00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:35,529
right if you start with a bad client

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:41,019
uh-huh change the light all right so the

00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:49,269
last story of the day so that's me with

00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:51,869
a lot of hair I don't like that

00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:56,289
not the hair part but the falling part

00:36:51,869 --> 00:37:00,599
so you know every now and then I get

00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:05,109
into this downward spiral which is where

00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:06,039
things are completely stuck nothing

00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:09,789
seems to be working

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:14,799
everything seems to be going wrong okay

00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:15,490
like just recently sir tons of things

00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,890
going on

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:21,009
my dad has cancer and you know that's

00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,960
kind of deteriorated so I have to take

00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:25,839
care of that we have tons of things

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,220
going on in office lots of product

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,499
releases lots of things to do in

00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:34,420
marketing and just the kind of problems

00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:39,839
that you saw right I mean hard problems

00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:46,420
that I have to solve and I feel stuck I

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:49,619
feel alone I feel overwhelmed I question

00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,619
Eric q

00:37:51,240 --> 00:38:02,550
and I can't figure out a way and when

00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:05,010
that happens it's like a downward spiral

00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,980
it's like I'm going down faster and

00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,990
faster and faster so I don't enjoy the

00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,109
work that I'm doing I'm probably getting

00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:19,619
irritated with small things and a lot of

00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:23,280
things and why I bring that up because

00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:28,339
you will face this or something similar

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:31,920
in your life more often than you like I

00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:38,580
hope it's not as bad but you will face

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:43,980
these downward spirals how did he give

00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:47,130
you that right because you want to chase

00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:51,260
your dreams you'll go after the big

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:54,800
things and you stuck down there

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,800
falling tumbling down

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:12,040
so what has worked for me is is what I'm

00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:12,040
now called a three-step formula which is

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:20,210
not the arm but it's a plus a plus a

00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:25,340
equals M the first a stands for

00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:28,760
awareness so if I'm aware that I'm stuck

00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:31,370
when I get aware that okay I'm into this

00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,500
downward spiral then only I can do

00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,450
anything because awareness precedes

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,420
change before you can chain anything you

00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:40,790
have to be aware of it measurement

00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,120
precedes awareness until you measure

00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:46,280
something you cannot even be aware of it

00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,810
but I kind of measure I cannot track

00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,640
myself that what is the change in

00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:53,960
behavior and me that okay am i getting

00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:56,420
irritated am i eating late at nights am

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,460
i doing late nights am i just am i

00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,860
skipping my exercise am i skipping my

00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,810
good habits when that happens that's a

00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,960
clear sign then I'm in that downward

00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:08,120
spiral okay so I want to be aware that

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,810
I'm in a downward spiral first and

00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:18,760
foremost once I'm aware of my downward

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:23,950
spiral the next step is the hardest step

00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:27,099
the next step is to accept it

00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:30,579
and acceptance is really hard anybody

00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:36,819
who's had a heartbreak knows how hard it

00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:38,109
is to accept no we're not hopefully

00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:42,670
we're not talking about that those kind

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:44,980
of heartbreaks often but whenever you

00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:48,369
are in a tough situation you basically

00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,859
want to just run away you do not want to

00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:52,390
deal with it you just want somebody else

00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:57,640
to deliver that and you don't wanna deal

00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:59,260
with it but what really makes a

00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,970
difference what will really make a

00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,460
difference to you and your life and your

00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:09,220
people around you is if you accept that

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:12,400
situation as it is don't fight it it may

00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:16,829
not be your fault right it may be the

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,779
circumstance but just accept it as it is

00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:25,329
because this is magical

00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:28,420
once you accept it that bulb will go

00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:31,960
light up again you know that bug that

00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:35,410
happened in the shower earlier that ball

00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,769
will come again because then you'll find

00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,769
a way out

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,910
and once you find the way out all you

00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:47,670
have to do is act that's the next day

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:49,589
act and if you cannot figure out if the

00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,990
bug doesn't go like okay the electricity

00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:52,859
board doesn't like you very much and

00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,040
they've cut off your power supply

00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:59,700
whatever if the bug doesn't go out again

00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:05,780
I mean if the light doesn't go all you

00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:08,130
have to do still act what can you act

00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:10,020
pick up something small pick up

00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,579
something the simplest action that you

00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,440
can take at the moment if you're stuck

00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,000
in a problem the simplest mo if if the

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,520
simplest action that you can think of at

00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,579
that moment is to go out and run go out

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:25,380
and run as in like not run away but like

00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:29,190
run as an exercise no cycle just do one

00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,490
action don't sulk and like you know cry

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,750
on yourself and take pity on yourself

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:36,990
and you can do that no problem no

00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:40,670
problem with tears but beyond that don't

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:45,450
just keep sulking get out take action

00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:47,579
take any action by the way and then

00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,810
think about the next action and then

00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,540
think about the next action and then

00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:55,250
think about the next action why because

00:42:51,540 --> 00:43:02,099
that feeds into itself and it creates

00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:07,069
momentum and momentum my friends is the

00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:11,130
key once you get something into momentum

00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:12,750
there is nothing stopping it no matter

00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,480
how hard the problem is no matter how

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,190
big the challenge is no matter how

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,109
impossible the dream looks like once you

00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:23,060
set in motion once you're in momentum

00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:23,060
you are bound to get it

00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:32,480
and this is simple formula just act act

00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,480
act that's gonna be momentum

00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:46,420
so we told you about dreaming I'm now

00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:50,060
inviting you to stop dreaming because

00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:53,120
that's the reality most of us walk half

00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:58,010
asleep like we are just in the Dre

00:43:53,120 --> 00:44:00,260
dreams yes yes pathani thought we would

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,910
take a new day right but we like Acharya

00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,070
currently currently occurring in Mira a

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,900
startup my funding Osheaga Midna billion

00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:13,340
Kamiya occurring ocarina let me come to

00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:16,490
being real so working doing the actions

00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,960
is most important that builds the

00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:22,370
momentum that's gonna get you to your

00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:25,610
dreams so take action because like I

00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:29,810
said consistency is the ultimate key to

00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:38,170
success do small things do them

00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:44,599
repeatedly that will compound thank you

00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:44,599
