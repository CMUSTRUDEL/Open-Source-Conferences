[Music]

00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,179
[Music]

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,999
[Music]

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,760
our engineer is the initial will be

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,200
talking about the concept that although

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,800
not new is really becoming more

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,100
prevalent in software development vigil

00:00:46,800 --> 00:01:01,629
in general and for front-end work

00:00:51,100 --> 00:01:05,500
people end up these infesting so okay

00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:07,090
this to be super goof just a big Dalton

00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,670
they are only a few minutes

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,670
so this is about reactant library I'm

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,640
just I used to deliver Lord Wedgwood

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,509
not anymore so what the hell are they

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,880
doing here

00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:24,100
I worked at a company called equal

00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,890
experts again we don't do anything we'll

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,340
just do WordPress for your consultancy

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,960
network agile methodologies we do a lot

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,170
of stuff like extreme programming

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:48,759
everybody do you mean we try to get in

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:52,659
teams so what the hell does this have to

00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,190
do with worker as well one of the

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,219
technologies that we've been working

00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,350
with this reactor there is snow level

00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:02,890
and everywhere including WordPress with

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,200
given variant locks and if it is

00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,090
heavenly CMS solutions that are starting

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,680
to be show up where you have a wordpress

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:15,280
it services again graph below or restful

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,690
the REST API that we sent consumed by

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,730
this dark squares

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:23,049
front end that's community public

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:25,420
address and so next thing gave me a lot

00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:27,910
of friction in in WordPress and I said

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,750
no or not but let's talk about testing

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:34,660
reactive ones and especially missing

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,790
them with confidence and the front end

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,890
destiny for you

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,620
it's been a little bit of a boogeyman in

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,870
software engineering because it's not

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,049
trivial already started it doesn't mean

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,819
brutal you can write this for Becca and

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,319
logic it's pretty simple no font you

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,330
think something should help with

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,980
something invested fine but front-end

00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,569
well there's this webpage there this

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,940
user clothes

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:03,540
there's log in another state anything

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,810
it's safety test and start leave been

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,950
doing some setting up some stacks with

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,099
place on the selenium so what selenium

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,500
does is it speaks up a web browser and

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:20,340
event control the web browser to

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:24,480
navigate the page for you and test the

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:28,519
page is correct run with this this hell

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,459
of us had a guest break if the page

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,019
breaks for some reason it's necessary

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,829
people to change your eating yes

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,319
especially something like given birth

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:43,079
and you're really little slow because

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:47,400
your interaction real application and

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:51,390
you are subject to delays over here

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,760
so you spin up the browser luckily for

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,160
London open the page or wait for it to

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,010
load and if you just want to decimal

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:03,330
stupid button or a cornfield it's a lot

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:06,390
of work and this kind of if you do TV

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,080
you want this feedback seconds let's be

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,030
quick you want to save the file run the

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,889
test automatically and see if it does

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,959
right you would in a second ideally so

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,690
what that's to be really warm up this

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,520
long give you a test like can you use

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:28,410
directly with selenium or firstly in

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,320
London to be robust you're going to test

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,810
to break because they're a database

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,470
field somewhere and disciple oh that's

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,419
not good

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,820
and you wanted to be maintainable

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,250
because that's our your specifications

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,539
because if changes you have to take

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:50,580
those tests today in order to be fast

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:52,650
okay so specifically to react there's a

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,479
library that came up that was built on

00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:01,860
top of react a series called answer and

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:05,280
what the enzyme does is it it wraps your

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,950
component in isolation and you're able

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,639
you don't need to prosecute but it all

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:15,240
happens in your test approval so it

00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,310
generates like this you know HTML

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,190
structure and then you click the button

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,720
if you love before the person made to

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,750
check and everything's been called a

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,930
checker you're given three years when

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,760
structure is really readable it's really

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,680
convenient really fast because it's not

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,280
the end of the project it has the test

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,740
your

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:40,020
the issue or your opponents but this

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,520
problem depends on in depth its API

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:48,660
which is super powerful but it doesn't

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:52,980
carry their son nasty practices one of

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,919
them is decimal division units primarily

00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:02,460
it's something called shuttle redbrick

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:05,310
if there's also a few methods that allow

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,830
you to inspect a component state and it

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,830
right assertions on it and the Plymouth

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,990
stick is not something that's exposed to

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:17,720
the outside world and as such you're not

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:21,440
supposed to so with its show remember

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,410
missile let's suppose that we have this

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,450
fake form that's built in react you're

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,880
the form and then inside of a component

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,729
for a final blow and in a book filled

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,280
the checkbox and submit button and then

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,680
the Philip load behaves in such a way

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,830
that when you very violent with he

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,210
immediately starts an appropriate lesson

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,950
from this with unit tests you want to

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,970
unit that's this you have a side effect

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,640
right here

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,890
so if you don't specify the clothes you

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,729
have to prevent or somehow intercept

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,979
this request from being affirmed so the

00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:58,770
solution is well the solution that

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:02,220
enzyme presents its you shall render the

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,160
farm so the farm will fake

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,070
render the file upload input degenerate

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,520
reason they're there but not really so

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,470
when use directly front load he doesn't

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,960
do any network requests and you're able

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,780
to inspect the farm and say well I want

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,030
my farm to her Philip love checked doing

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,200
my farm to have an input to check in so

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:27,110
on and when I direct

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,270
I wanted to come back so so because this

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:33,920
never happens to intercept it everyone

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:36,520
except me until you have to change your

00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,110
for you put everything inside a fieldset

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,170
shall render their shell renders it

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,540
itself not to rest so all the tests that

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,570
you have to check your file upload the

00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,340
input and the checkbox will break even

00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:54,160
though you didn't do anything that

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:56,090
actually changed the meaning by the way

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:03,610
so now you have to do business

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:07,930
expectable diet you like the food itself

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,700
we are not supposed to be changing tests

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,200
when functionality doesn't change you

00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,180
just moved stuff around

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:20,660
so this freaking us you want to apply it

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:24,020
and it is your ability to refactor

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:27,050
really it's the same thing with react

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,000
components or functions if you look too

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,330
deeply into people in addition the delta

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,700
function in order to test it of network

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:38,240
if you look into the addition identity

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,979
mark internal dependencies like you

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,870
refactor something and that's what great

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:49,540
for no reason and then you get it right

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:55,190
and saving off-screen this and this and

00:08:49,540 --> 00:09:00,940
that or you pretend you're something you

00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,940
build because and perfecter dismiss the

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:07,160
factor is how you address that people

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:11,900
that you don't want to be prevented and

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,480
that should help you to refactor your

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:20,290
code with confidence knowing that stuff

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,290
is not going to break another button

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:29,089
there's another pony this is during

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,880
internal components that's an external

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:34,400
dependencies some modules that you have

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,690
from an empty understand they're using

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,500
it with

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,820
shall render e you break your guests in

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,560
such a way that you don't have to

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,270
interact with there are the component

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,940
which she makes again that makes sense

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:50,810
you're not supposed to ask other people

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:53,450
still but if they're third-party

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,240
component breaks your application braces

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,600
you have to make sure that whatever you

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,310
put in there see it works so you're

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,870
gonna test it if you have to make sure

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:07,640
you insert okay so this is enough to

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,540
write this integration test for my

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,770
components well there's a bit of a it's

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,450
inserted

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:19,339
describe what you need agree she test

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,380
actually yes there's this I think was it

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,730
you can't pack

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:26,750
Martin Pawley one of the edge of tests

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,760
with the workshop and they asked the

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,450
wrong the what's your definition of the

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,450
intuition

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,460
so it's a very fuzzy on the testing

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,470
period

00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,780
this doesn't vary me means that if you

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:45,880
get steps you need to you lie you gets

00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:49,190
word desks that cost Martin a day

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,440
whereas if you write unit tests which is

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,810
our testing an individual function or an

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,030
individual class or module then you get

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,880
really fast tests that are very

00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,410
straightforward to read chief to

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,160
maintain below

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:07,190
you're not decimal division on this and

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,290
this it's a very blurry thing something

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,860
to again agree not so the unit tests

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,070
must run in isolation the unit vestments

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,400
focus on a small particle system and the

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,140
universe muscle test this distance are

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:26,150
generally really want me to do have

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:30,260
definition of unit s characters but what

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,180
this unit mean Bluff developers look at

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,240
unit and things now if the best in

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,700
function every passenger class after

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,680
test every resident only and that's not

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:45,920
putting it yes so when you adopt a

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,390
strategy of Des American limits using in

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:54,470
enzyme you go down this rabbit hole

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:57,980
- usually not so good results because

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,900
you tend to best every single component

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,470
that you have even though you might not

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,750
need so a unit is whatever makes sense

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,460
to you make sense to your project even

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,910
within a project a certain component

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:14,380
might require the unit tests

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:16,300
more high-level developers and if you

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,440
look like different way to look at this

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,330
when you did that Student Development

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,820
you write the test before you recommend

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:27,010
in addition right right familiar with

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:29,560
the ended up anyone's STD so you write

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,500
one test for this and very right people

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,020
mutation it as asked in another test and

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,970
so on and so on when you write the test

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,340
you're not explicitly looking for

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,160
offenses it's like it's whatever it

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,930
takes to make the desk X doesn't matter

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,140
are many such components whether it's

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,850
the bonus or functions or whatever it

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,280
doesn't matter which sir components

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,070
whether their first Rd or written by

00:12:51,280 --> 00:13:05,110
something else you're not going to mark

00:12:53,070 --> 00:13:07,000
lodash either function just so as long

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,980
as the interface of your component or

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,420
your function doesn't change and I

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,540
refactor it yes should break that's the

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,790
ideal scenario here because if like I

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,950
said refactoring is key if you want to

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,860
address that can go down later on so

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,740
when you write a test for our components

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:31,690
and then you write the component let me

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:33,490
go to and make it more efficient that's

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,670
your brake system behavior doesn't

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,670
change

00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,829
so I'm skipping your facility

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:53,980
okay so either reactive labor a necklace

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,980
Mowgli was actually the right word or

00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:00,460
whether it's now a family of decimals

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,850
not just Leon cannabis with hypothetical

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,250
can see does it is a smoke that tweeted

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,620
more your test resembles the way your

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,130
software is being used more confidence

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,680
to be needed and this testing your code

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:18,160
from the perspective of the end user is

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,640
really powerful reactors entirely

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,980
depends on J is done which is the MU our

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,390
default in area that's where life just

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:31,150
if you suggest is just plug and play

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,770
otherwise it's mostly no test render

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,590
agnostic but you might have to do some

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,620
absolutely and it prevents a set of

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,990
primitives that mimic this user behavior

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,540
that you want to test so for example

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,030
yeah general queries again get something

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,100
by the text you can get something by its

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,400
title but the fact that you're getting

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,840
HTML you can get something by mouth

00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,160
that's like an image or vice every road

00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,790
yes you should include it for

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:05,950
accessibility I'm sitting for fuels you

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:10,300
can get an element by its display at the

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:13,390
moment or very placeholder text and this

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,640
is like searching our text or searching

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,040
by regular expression there are no CSS

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,010
selectors you don't need to know whether

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:24,280
the button is excited div or whether

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:27,420
there's a glass glass or especially it's

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,580
old it's the same way as a user user

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,400
your site or your application didn't

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:36,180
care if it's a bit of this desk class

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,400
acts are getting black right but it is

00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:42,450
see the X and that's the writer of this

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:46,200
test so simile is a department who cares

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:49,290
be excludable there's an escape hatch if

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,780
you can't use sex you can step an essay

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,780
and having a separate recipe although

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,490
not a meal it's better then you lined up

00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,200
some penis that's being used for

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,770
something else so if you have an ID that

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,810
you use for your functionality or a

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:07,830
classic use for spelling if you make

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:10,530
your pets and than that like your you're

00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,780
putting a chain around it and you won't

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,350
be able to later change that without

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,350
permission

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,400
and once you get back from this this

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,700
functions the see actual thumb nose and

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:29,590
like inside which you put this object

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:32,380
simulation a bunch of if using methods

00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:35,290
and structure but you get back to the

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:40,410
actual dominoes is if you run I'll get a

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:46,980
really like a little bra same thing and

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,980
events clicked is great double play

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,990
poker

00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:57,340
so exactly this is from an actual front

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,620
concealed intelligence it's pretty

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,530
straightforward so what you're guessing

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,240
here is believing something and they're

00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,480
confirming it and making sure that

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,910
condition matters you have a setup set

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,939
you get some test data it doesn't matter

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,610
what you just there but maybe if you

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:17,829
create that a mock function that's

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,770
called Henry beliefs and then you render

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:23,230
using reacts decimal every regular

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,980
component depresses the pacifist a

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,500
function and you get this methods that

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,410
you're going to use to direct with it

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:35,100
then it's simple as you click under but

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:38,320
anything that's still be on it

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,360
and then you wait for the confirm button

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,550
to the beer because it's a bump up and

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,100
maybe there's some animation or delay or

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,260
something like that and then you wait

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,660
for the handle function to be called

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,960
with the idea that you prefer this is

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,400
pretty straightforward to read or change

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,760
even if

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,070
it changes and it doesn't matter what

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,200
she used to believe is Italy ticket

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,080
button you can change it won't create

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,730
the test because your ass is focusing on

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,650
other matters so reckless and why we

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,290
encourage you do not do not test

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,809
implementation details it discourages

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,780
good accessibility practices because it

00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:22,660
will first you to provide clear and

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,690
ambiguous labels for your buttons so you

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,190
have two buttons that are all delete but

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,059
different things are some of the

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:33,700
different things may be in it work and

00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,100
as well as about the middle of every

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:40,540
release and accept you can actually use

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:43,390
query be honest on page as if you were

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:47,080
actually Jesus it's very simple it's

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:50,140
very likely listen fast and smooth but

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,870
you know this is like I said yeah so

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,550
there's some challenges under this one

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,860
of them is too many for real is

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,270
because we were testing the component at

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,140
a higher level I suppose it's your

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:05,080
Florida simulation tool in it you would

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:08,710
have to test the validation code dream

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,980
before are my relative there is possible

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:16,030
traditions you can first if you like

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,740
very similar test person as something

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,170
you should watch out for maybe it's

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,090
worth testing evaluation building

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,490
resolution and then just practice simple

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,450
test make sure and fill additionally not

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,450
for the farm

00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,570
ya know there's some other brittleness

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:38,049
where they change one thing and that's

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:42,100
great so in our example your television

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:44,590
who broke it will break out as for the

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,250
component even though it's not really

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:50,830
related in component and it would be

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:57,509
harder for you to determine exactly what

00:19:50,830 --> 00:20:00,190
for sale and this is a helpful feedback

00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:00,730
so perfectly things as separate as

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,399
possible

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:08,139
unfortunately there's no formula rule

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:12,450
for this you have to figure out what

00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:12,450
makes sense in the context of your right

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:18,879
there's officially examples you can go

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:22,210
on practice in the examples gives you it

00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:25,029
gives you a comparison between the same

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,279
tests reading for enzyme and rectus and

00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:31,860
vibrating other pretty words with and

00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:35,830
without the person will be beverages

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,379
with internationalisation for example

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,240
then gate gentleman so there's a few

00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:43,210
examples here talking loss loss and even

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,759
a lot to integrate this best with some

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,210
other libraries in the in the reactive

00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,250
the system is pretty useless

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:53,710
it's framework agnostic it's it's based

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,840
on some indical dumb testing library

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,450
which is under the hood so if you don't

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,929
use react at all or if you don't use any

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,789
particular library you can see it use

00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:06,340
some testing library which just gives

00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:12,999
you the same same kind of

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:16,239
if yes therefore angular react svelte

00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:20,259
view also work stuff that isn't

00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:22,539
front-end specific Sofia Cyprus to do to

00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:25,179
do your engine tests we can use this

00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:28,599
gives you the same nice API or you can

00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:31,029
select by the name I also forget the

00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:36,309
year and Escalade intend for react

00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:39,460
native Jason based on their really look

00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:42,099
and it's kind of delightfully yeah it

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,469
discourages discourages you from passing

00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:47,649
implementation details which can make no

00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:50,759
to break in tests and separate for no

00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:55,719
good reason you went to Europe has to be

00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:57,879
clear and precise about what went wrong

00:21:55,719 --> 00:22:00,549
and also if your courage is

00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:03,940
accessibility in your components because

00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:05,589
it forces you to go through to interact

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:09,580
with your components and go through them

00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:12,909
as if you were an actual user so either

00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:15,099
there's there's good verbal of textual

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:19,239
cues in your component or otherwise

00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:22,710
there's sufficient accessibility or

00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:25,960
produce set Andry rules for example two

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:33,789
titles all specs and so on to make sure

00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:36,039
that it's this and it's not a silver

00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:38,950
bullet it's not perfect I mentioned some

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:42,489
of the drawbacks I imagine a couple of

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:46,869
ways you can get around them directly to

00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:49,629
us so reactive I believe is simulator in

00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:52,899
the middle of things not really know

00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:54,549
closely from unit testing this is great

00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:55,880
this is pretty enough that you would

00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,240
have to make them your writing

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,120
yes the syphilis there is no formulas

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,500
you have to think about what you do and

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,760
what you wanted to help

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,880
yes if you want to get out your tests to

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,500
give your confidence in refectory

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,270
reference to the miracle you are

00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,980
committing and you'll be asked all the

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:19,160
time and you want to get to a state

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:23,960
where for example you write level of

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:26,990
your component on your editor with unit

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,630
tests running without ever opening the

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,340
browser and open the browser everything

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,530
just works

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,309
screams rip field and you can do that

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:39,020
with test if you have to you have to be

00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:41,390
a little distant visible if you're those

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,549
it's not just writing unit tests is

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,070
ready the write unit tests

00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:52,490
so figuring out where exactly you want

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:54,620
to move this key here there's some great

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,830
stuff here it's it prevents you from

00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,650
making basic mistakes like unlike ensign

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,299
vests and enzyme is great but it is a

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:08,710
food again you don't want to shoot

00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:08,710
yourself and that's it

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:31,690
I think top means what if you want to

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:35,590
test a component that uses a slightly so

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:42,129
depends on that with his posh so it's

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:43,509
not it's yeah it depends on what again

00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:49,330
what tests you want to write you could

00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:52,450
write a simple test that stated mock you

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:55,330
could want three tax matters if you want

00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,159
also we could relax methods in there

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,429
that's everything through to the moment

00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,990
it's probably not ideal but this is it

00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:04,419
is what if you wanted a you want to

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,860
replace Ramesh with something else the

00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:08,980
name of a bunch of that's it and you

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:14,679
can't care if this with us fantasies and

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:16,419
you could react roots and and get you

00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,409
the same results without waiting to test

00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:22,450
that's sweet but on the other hand it's

00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:25,019
like community real exclusion there's a

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:28,509
lot of stuff going on smithy 1s

00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:30,159
constructively some producers directly

00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:34,470
or some some even where's the red leads

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:38,610
and dirty for the right balance between

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:42,629
on on do react part of the rendering

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:45,629
process and everything more complicated

00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:45,629
marketplace

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:52,299
but from my experience we deep in the

00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:56,919
project decide to move away from

00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:59,529
brunettes and having too many tests but

00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,239
looking at the exit Southwest with pain

00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:05,239
we wanted to move away from it but we

00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:07,809
have to rewrite healthy tasks to look at

00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:10,399
the component in there who were free to

00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:13,159
actually start with us it simply

00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:14,929
actually for example vehicles which

00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,779
we've built much simpler but because

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:21,339
we're guessing agree that's not what get

00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:21,339
yourself in hockey a tradition itself

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,530
[Music]

00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,339
[Applause]
