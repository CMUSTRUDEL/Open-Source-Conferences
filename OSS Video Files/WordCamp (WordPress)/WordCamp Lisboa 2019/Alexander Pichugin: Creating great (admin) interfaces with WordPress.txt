so

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,800
[Music]

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,249
[Music]

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,939
[Music]

00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:02,289
[Music]

00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:23,990
using WordPress the CIA management

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:31,070
framework I wolves to be business

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:34,670
websites and that's why Roach and how to

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,130
great easy to use interface for the

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,200
final user which is not you as a

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:44,000
developer which is your most probably

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:51,560
find other ad agency owners or business

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,540
owners and other any content managers

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,590
that have doing with the main WordPress

00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:09,020
installations deal and do like old

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:14,989
installations or okay we need to define

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:19,269
what is a good user interface and what

00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:24,140
makes it good and there is a definition

00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:28,040
it allows the user to do the things both

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:32,810
efficiently and effectively they're not

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:38,140
different by the way there is it's not

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:42,470
so obvious and another distraction and

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:48,769
there are three golden rules of the good

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:55,780
interface they all defined pretty pretty

00:02:48,769 --> 00:03:02,360
well and many talks and I did change the

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:04,740
words of them and adopted for the modern

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,650
world and the first one is the reduced

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:13,140
beautiful that means you probably know

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:16,700
the definition not make people think

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:20,610
which is care comes from the truth booth

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:24,020
don't make a thing and that basically

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:27,840
means that if you do it something that

00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:33,810
caused people to struggle they will most

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:36,650
likely leave hate or whatever it will

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:41,780
not be satisfied and if there is no

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:44,700
promise attention there is no way to

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,780
struggle with your interface people will

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,840
be more satisfied and there is a good

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,700
example not from there

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,040
this one places dimension your

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,050
interaction with the band what is the

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,830
good interaction with the bank it's

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,070
something that doesn't cause you any

00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:08,520
error struggles and you don't get in the

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:11,550
holidays with the pocket part because of

00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,970
the band so let's use user experience

00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:20,150
and it's a good communication base

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:22,410
whatever God and second rule is make

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,140
everything in this case interface

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,650
consistent that means everything stays

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,920
in the same place all the time and also

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:35,850
it is obvious where we can find things

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,150
and in terms of the business website

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:42,180
interfaces that means that your content

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:47,120
manager owner website will be able to

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:52,310
find anything in living area

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,940
so like we have block news team projects

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,800
on the front end and basically the ethos

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,389
situation we need to create a safe

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,030
structure on the web or to use content

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:08,900
editor which is doubtful thing sometimes

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:14,150
and the third thing is kiss everyone

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:20,389
knows what is kiss no it's not about a

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:22,880
sub Regina Sh okay and very important

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:26,060
thing keep it simple and stupid not only

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,450
applies to your user and also applies to

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,220
you as a developer do not over

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:37,330
exaggerate things where it's not

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:43,700
necessary keep it simple keep it useful

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:47,720
make it really like straightforward kiss

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,240
not harm and I will show you some

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,530
samples that's risky

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,370
all right as a developer go opt-in to

00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:00,229
work trace like seven or six years ago

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,810
before that I was working with UX design

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:07,490
content development at home and then I

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,760
discovered WordPress at that time there

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:15,130
were no like page builders they were

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:19,820
just emerging they were normal really

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:24,050
easy to use custom metal fuels plugins

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:27,560
so that is a big dumb example I would

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,440
say for anomalies remember is quite like

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,919
six years old it's a single page website

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,820
right so basically what do you think you

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,640
would do

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:44,420
to make that net thing in terms of the

00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:49,040
interface and there are principles that

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:53,590
I mentioned the day I was here first of

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:58,730
all all the sections are in the

00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:02,210
intersections custom post type and we

00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:08,270
can rearrange them and you can change

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,400
there of course and that's what was the

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:16,040
part of to keeping it simple right and

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:19,790
also serve the services just hanging

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,490
remember this like really old thing

00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:25,120
don't think that is a great finish the

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,440
silicate first application of principles

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,640
but you're something here are the

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,600
brothers right as we see here and each

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:40,850
product have a custom metal boxes which

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:45,170
remain based in the functions and that's

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:49,490
that's the theme which I considered like

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:51,470
more useful because we have the atomic

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,880
information that is displayed on the

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,930
front end and this more or less

00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,940
consistent here and it's the same

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,160
consistent anatomic in the admin area so

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,580
you don't have a lot block which will

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:12,140
break the skin style and you don't have

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:15,770
face builders which generating basically

00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:22,030
a lot of unnecessary cover the most

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:25,310
cases so that's the first example then

00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,360
now I should apologize because the rest

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:31,130
of examples will be available in Russian

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,070
but you don't need to read the text you

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:40,199
just need to see the image and

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:46,560
to see the stuff on front end it was an

00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:52,709
MVP startup for like the in creator of

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:54,180
hotels in different places and at that

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,910
point it's very important what was

00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,029
referred about the customer expects

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:03,149
always and so when we start to think

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:05,310
about such like website in terms of very

00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:10,380
conventional architecture we need to

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:13,050
define which things will be our custom

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:17,779
posts like in that case there are

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:21,630
articles there are they call it cars

00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:25,500
which basically means the hotel car and

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:27,810
there are custom endings for the less

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,769
expensive products and I will show you

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:35,029
an example the article this article page

00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:38,880
is google translate so don't be scared

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:41,790
and it's pretty huge and I want you to

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:46,160
think about how we would make thing like

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,160
that four years ago

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:59,080
it basically looks like more or less

00:09:53,589 --> 00:10:04,990
just plain commentary right but he knows

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,620
my opinion he knows one thing that's

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,330
here

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:15,880
here are the sections we shot the vision

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:19,200
of those sections and basically when you

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,490
click on them is like more than media

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,459
approach when you click on level you get

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,430
to the straight to the point and those

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:30,910
things also highlighted on the front end

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,709
so you basically can not grab them from

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,589
the content you should define them as

00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:40,750
atomic pieces and what comes to the

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:43,810
second part it have the same structure

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:47,620
with atomic pieces we only have a

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:50,860
diffusion here like the sir then we have

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:54,839
shows of the main page I can you might

00:10:50,860 --> 00:11:01,480
seem that content for them and then a

00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:03,660
lot of things which define the article

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,660
and

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:16,640
here that is made with the flexible and

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,550
repeated fields that means that you can

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,940
attend time commits any type of the

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:26,690
quantity name place rearrange them

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:30,040
switch them and basically change the

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,040
star so I'll show you

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:43,730
wait yeah so here those top things those

00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:45,530
titles alright from here and here is the

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,780
content right here isn't it except that

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,880
we have seen on top here is there that

00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,790
content here's the gallery and each

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:57,920
gallery piece have a speech and that

00:11:52,790 --> 00:12:02,090
implies the total custom content team of

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,280
course and the custom flexible admin

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:07,190
area and here it's important to

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:11,620
understand that this will be supported

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:15,800
by real people and it might seem like

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:18,050
it's too complicated but finish the

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,990
atomic pieces of the information that

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,540
are that we are able to rearrange and

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:27,620
people are able to maintain them easily

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:30,730
and consistently are in fact saving time

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:35,210
for businesses because if the interfaces

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:37,130
badly made then on which is each new

00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:41,210
article edition

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,100
people will spend 5 10 15 years extra

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:50,150
that will cost you money or child

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:55,280
whatever this place the other approach

00:12:50,150 --> 00:13:00,370
here's the vision website and the thing

00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,870
is here the content is also treated like

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,990
magazine in the magazine style with lot

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:09,399
of graphics and

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:14,490
with some custom things and as you see

00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:18,130
the image is also customer masks and

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:22,060
here is the position of the other thing

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,399
don't don't make a community for user

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,860
because in that case the person that

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:32,440
contained that website is absolutely

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:35,760
like not there in any way and that's why

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,350
this interface uses a lot of the

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,850
WordPress core functionality like

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:44,649
everything that we've seen there with a

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:49,830
complex galleries on the full screen I

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:52,870
using basically the default WordPress

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:55,290
gallery shortcode and the images are

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:59,290
automatically cropped automatically

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:03,550
placed into the place itself and most

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:06,480
beautiful thing here is the code that

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,320
you make to make a front-end part

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,040
imagine that is the archive of it all

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:19,630
where it's all projects you see us like

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,959
20 30 lines of code and it is the code

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:28,680
of the single page that we have seen

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,680
with all those I will show it in details

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:48,279
here we have like all those things all

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:51,910
those atomic pieces right so this is all

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,890
itemized and it maintains to be as

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:57,970
simple as possible for the final user

00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:00,660
which is not expert at all and which

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,210
have a bit of experience with the

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,300
default WordPress functionality

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:08,970
with low costs and that's why it is

00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:14,400
maintained to represent his experience

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:17,910
he's he's his life and here is what what

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:26,570
we see which doesn't pass someone on the

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:33,800
right so one more example I still wait

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:38,820
is it interesting at all and ok that

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:45,420
last example is like most complex by now

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:48,390
I think and it to presents let's say the

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:54,240
landing page for the particular single

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:57,840
event both the cultural and artistic

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,390
painting center of Moscow and that

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,990
requires not scrolling in the

00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:06,410
presentation but showing you on the

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,410
levels

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,380
here's the thing how it looks like on

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:16,730
the web and

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:19,540
it is it is people translated for your

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,579
convenience you can see the things and

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,130
here you see a lot of custom stuff like

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:28,970
it's like magazine raising their layouts

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:31,639
and whatever quite right and how do we

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:35,889
do how do we deal with that and also

00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:39,110
there are related items from the store

00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:43,850
how how do we deal with that basically

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:47,569
right and also again why's the custom

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:51,370
fields custom that's imposed with dozens

00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:55,730
of stories here we have it's only

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:57,350
defining the type of day where which

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,740
will be displayed of course from that

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:05,299
and which will be used for the filtering

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:08,020
on top of the Phoenix here we go there

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:13,610
is a futures for all type of events and

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:18,799
you just choose here or how many the

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:20,839
thing and you do you define that person

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,510
who said and we want me because you

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,549
can't have a single event which will be

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:29,720
the constant concerts and lecture the

00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:34,880
same time and with any custom taxonomy

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:38,990
you default able to sell several various

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:43,130
products online and there is also a

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:46,400
great and very useful most evil thing I

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,350
will type it in details when Alice's but

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,870
it's important to know about the how to

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,750
make easy to use also lingual website

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:56,780
just just a button which switches

00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,909
basically all the content which does

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,650
require translation but does not switch

00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:01,350
the things that it does not require

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,350
translation

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,960
because dates the definition is one day

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,690
with several days and the type of day

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,980
over them they are not switched the

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:16,470
images are not switched

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:18,899
they are maintained and here here is an

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:22,710
example we can change what we have seen

00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:26,580
there the background we can change which

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:29,429
we shoot if it is the event with the pro

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,850
calendar page or not and all the things

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:36,509
that we've seen there of the top story

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:39,720
of the like magazine and ready-made type

00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:42,899
of layout you can see it here you can

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,600
basically edit anything like there are

00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:50,309
three different pieces even made

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:54,059
whatever you want how many you want put

00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:59,820
them like that the best from design more

00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:02,879
from the interface and here also we were

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,070
trying to adopt how it was represented

00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:09,350
on the front end like if we have an

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:11,879
image on the right type on top and

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,370
description of the image that they are

00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:17,340
from that will represent the same thing

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,529
on the back end and there is another

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,889
type an English in the left that we

00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:23,820
switch it is basically like the rules

00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:26,549
what I've been saying about the

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,220
consistency if people choosing where I

00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:30,419
want to walk with the emission black it

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,580
will appear with the image to the left

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:37,500
it's like it's so like obvious thing but

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,540
it's important to do not forget about

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:46,660
that

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:49,220
and of course most important thing there

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,490
wanted to tell about those things in

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,440
this approach you can make a goal that's

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,620
like the greatest thing you can make

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,780
it'll be using only on WordPress or

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,630
functionality you will struggle a bit

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:08,330
with the custom fields I mean it still

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:10,370
is for you basically we'll start with

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,220
one time making and understanding the

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:16,430
custom post types Pacific economies but

00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,850
then the world is like great because you

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:23,150
can make any kind of things and then

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,550
apply on the continent complex filters

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,930
and do whatever we want with the custom

00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:34,280
taxonomies like you can create versatile

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:38,740
events calendars even create example

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:41,090
tracing the event moon calendar with

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,400
conform with the several dates several

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:51,920
types waltz or might on the WordPress

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:52,970
the REST API and and I was using a CF

00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,990
bra

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:59,840
he's basically easier life drastically

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,360
it allows you to create those repeater

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,020
fields and there's called flexible

00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,280
fields

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:11,080
means that you make as many blocks as

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,440
you want and choose a daily outside

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,440
whatever is shown

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:26,380
the type of those layouts they are

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:28,929
flexible so that's basically about this

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,809
approach I was trying to get into 20

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:34,480
minutes so I didn't get into much detail

00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:38,080
so if you have more questions on the

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,140
approach how to make those things easy

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,490
to ease your life to ease your customers

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,960
slide and sound

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:51,270
feel free to contact me and don't forget

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,950
that if you make the interface which is

00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,919
useful and easy to use you won't be

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,820
contacted in three years like your maybe

00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,710
website

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,000
can you change those things for me I

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,000
don't understand this thing here

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,349
[Applause]

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,559
it's like both things because this great

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,260
fish

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:09,230
I was referring that there was a project

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:11,870
where we should quite a lot more things

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:21,470
which could be made easier with the

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:24,049
approach but it was made that way and it

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:29,299
was I was saying where we gain focus on

00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:33,350
the main user because basically we want

00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,860
to get back to old crows in like five

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,710
years

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:41,260
and those websites are working for all

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,260
this time and let me

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,759
[Music]

00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:56,259
two Republicans take notes so

00:23:52,769 --> 00:24:00,970
consistency means the overall

00:23:56,259 --> 00:24:05,340
information structure and the approach

00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:09,309
that you take minds instruction

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:12,309
information this community for instead

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:14,139
given thinking about the user if you

00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:16,269
will maintain your own wall you can do

00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:19,690
what everyone if you're focusing on

00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:21,789
their experience and furniture you can

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:26,109
do more complex things and agree with

00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:28,629
them but that's it like that might be

00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:31,269
possible because if you a lot of

00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:34,090
complexity of flexibility to the

00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:36,489
interface some point will break

00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:39,700
always invest people operating things

00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:41,559
and keep it simple stupid applies for

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,690
you as well

00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:49,359
don't overcomplicate that's it like if

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,309
things could be made in a simple way

00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,309
that would interfere with

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,910
