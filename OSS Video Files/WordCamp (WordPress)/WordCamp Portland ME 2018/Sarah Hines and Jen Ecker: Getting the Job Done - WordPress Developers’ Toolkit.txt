Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	Curious how other WordPress professionals build sites, and what tools they use to get the job done? Two seasoned developers, one frontend, one backend, will go take you through how they approach building WordPress business sites from scratch (including from a starter themes), what priorities matter to them and why, and what software/techniques they use to build great sites.

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,279
[Music]

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,129
[Music]

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,409
[Music]

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:12,569
[Music]

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,339
[Music]

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,959
[Music]

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,480
[Music]

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,960
[Music]

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,740
[Music]

00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,220
things like that we also don't typically

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:04,970
to be Thomas work and almost never site

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:07,550
builders we just want to go through sort

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,000
of what our process is for a typical

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,680
site overall processes importance it's

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,930
good to have a standard and an

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,150
understanding contending of a pattern

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,810
you can repeat it and you can improve on

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,970
it to make it run better and also

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,140
understand risks points and where things

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:29,240
like rails I will say we're talking

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,070
about our preferred process but if you

00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:37,610
work with clients or you work on other

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:39,170
sites project is unique so although

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,940
ideally we would like to do this in

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:47,360
every instance we do want to recognize

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:50,000
that sometimes so we just want to sort

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,580
of lay these out to give you an idea and

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,310
these soft skills and processes are just

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,170
such an important part of project

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,680
success beyond the technology that we

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,210
decide to use so the first thing we do

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,280
is we have an interview questionnaire

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,600
before we commit to any work we want

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,900
ensure that they're happy can we work on

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,670
referral if it's an inappropriate match

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,440
if we can't make them happy to meet

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,510
their goals then we're not getting a

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:23,180
great referral so we want to as early in

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:27,050
the process determined should we can

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,610
usually get some of these would be like

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,280
what are there

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,050
goals for their website Rancho always

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:40,590
has some clear goals but then you can

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:40,590
meet those goals is also very important

00:04:41,250 --> 00:05:01,620
is going in thinking about what they

00:04:49,659 --> 00:05:01,620
really want timeline is important or

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:47,740
sometimes I think what's really

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:55,870
important going in any project is what

00:05:47,740 --> 00:06:02,139
is our core priorities personal skills

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:04,419
so for us we want to build a client

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:07,400
friendly sites that will be the content

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:11,060
that are backed by really good code

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,520
accessible and and when we're doing the

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,889
work we want to use best practices we

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,539
want to use cutting-edge tools make them

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,720
polished it's something at the end and

00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:23,090
have a smooth development and deployment

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,740
process and along the way you want to

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:34,550
work on something that loves orange

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:36,650
juice we move into discover research

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:41,150
plan this is sort of the prep work ahead

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,860
of building a website since we do a lot

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,570
of work with agencies quite often

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:56,930
they'll do a lot of the heavy lifting on

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:59,240
this but we still need to know and so at

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,780
this point is when we start actually big

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,729
dates map out the calendar we have a

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:13,010
timeline for when we expect things to

00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:14,630
get done what are we going to be handing

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,620
off to the client at the end what can

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:21,289
they expect we do sort of a tech check

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:25,250
so what kind of technology access to we

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:29,660
need probably access to DNS do they have

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:32,739
any API is there using if they have a

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,739
[Music]

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,690
and then as any project or many projects

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,699
whoever is doing the interview and the

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,020
proposal quite often is different than

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,750
who's going to be part of the product

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,280
team so who are the stakeholders who are

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:59,070
you're going to be working with and sort

00:07:50,280 --> 00:08:01,949
of get up to speed so the next step and

00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,050
I will like sort of stop and say these

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,340
aren't necessarily sequential

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,740
quite often some of these things are

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,750
happening happening at the same time but

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,090
I have a big fan of starting content

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,370
very very early in the process because

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,539
content is really what you're doing

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,050
you're supposed to be featuring their

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:20,910
content so if you're doing the design it

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,840
should support whatever content they've

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:26,479
decided to have so I always push for

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,620
content very early in the process

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,380
especially if the clients seeing their

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,719
own content they never have a good

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,839
expectation of how much time it's going

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,000
to take it is probably the most time

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,740
consuming part of the entire project

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,580
building the site is easy I think

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,580
compared to

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,810
and it's going to take me like two weeks

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,399
of get it right back to you that's maybe

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,139
if they built the safe before they have

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,320
to get some understanding like that but

00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,630
in them and also again you know it

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,459
doesn't have to be done perfectly but

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:12,170
having at least some structure so I know

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:17,420
I'm gonna have news articles I'm gonna

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:20,839
have a headline and kind of mapping that

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,089
out also doing an inventory or audit of

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,510
current content that's been a Vienna

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:29,120
move over is it gonna get rewritten and

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,250
then also gathering assets this is a

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
great time to start thinking about you

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,220
need to hire a photographer because you

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,019
want new headshots for your website

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:41,019
where the logos them down

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,670
[Music]

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,060
a list of all the templates that we will

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,410
be creating for a particular site all

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,520
the Global's the header the footer and

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,590
any short codes that we need to produce

00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,570
for that particular client and this is

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,240
documenting down to a pretty fine grain

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:57,610
detail what exactly needs to be the

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,340
functionality to our website and this

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,230
saves or let all the time because we are

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,360
documenting it early enough in the

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:07,780
process that anytime there's a change

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,330
we're able to reflect back and say hey

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,490
this is what we were doing agreed to do

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,830
we need to change the budget we need to

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:19,990
do a change order like can we replace

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:22,750
something else so it's and sharing it

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,410
with the client so that they go yeah no

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,420
I'm a little bored with that and it's

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,620
not this holding them accountable or

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,980
improving what you said you were going

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,020
to do it's also like you forget

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,490
especially a project it's like we're

00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,230
gonna be done in four months and then

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,000
it's twelve months you're not gonna

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,530
remember what we said in the early part

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
so being able to refer it back to that

00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:50,490
document and say oh yeah this is

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:53,080
supposed to be a file upload okay so

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,700
hopefully they understand the client

00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,670
and their project onset and we

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,080
definitely need some technical choices

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,300
because we produce all this

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,510
documentation we have our functional

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,670
spec we've got supplement at least

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,620
content or at least idea of the content

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,100
and snack set setting up logos will get

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:19,090
prompts maybe some photography and we've

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:22,930
got again the documentation and so now

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:26,320
we're actually I think which is build

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:29,979
the site today we're going to talk about

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,979
[Music]

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:44,050
okay so I so one of the key important

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,200
parts for this step is doing some sort

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:50,320
of wire framing this can be super low

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,360
fidelity pen and paper when a whiteboard

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,150
or you can get fancier with you know

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,120
specialty software and even wider frame

00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,920
with a DML but basically if you're not

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,920
familiar with life anything it's taking

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,180
we take the functional spec we know sort

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,830
of what the content is going to be in

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:12,580
which certain walked out you know map

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:14,740
each template so we have some idea of

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,960
how it's gonna it's gonna lay out where

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,220
the pieces need to be and this is also

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,260
super helpful because quite often

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,670
there's things that come out and we're

00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,200
trimming don't you didn't think about

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,910
when we're writing our functional spec

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,610
because our functional spec is quite

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,350
often an outline document when we start

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,070
drawing on a board for like oh yeah

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:35,720
there's going to be a drop down alpha

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:38,579
instance so this is pretty important

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,680
step and it really doesn't have to be I

00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,889
think a lot of times with budget it sort

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,149
of can get dropped it doesn't have to be

00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:48,180
super time-consuming and it's really

00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:51,029
gonna help you later on the other piece

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,839
of this is actual the actual visual

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:57,089
design working with agencies quite often

00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,139
they have a designer and how so I might

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:03,000
get PSPs that I need to use to great CSS

00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,509
and HTML to make the website look like

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,639
what the PSD is it really depends on

00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:14,310
when you sketch file if we do the design

00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,440
in-house which we do sometimes I'm very

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,949
comfortable writing code so I tend to

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:24,050
just skip and not use graphic software

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,050
to design I just started in the browser

00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:42,120
and then we take the design and

00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:48,089
JavaScript to create visual and at the

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:50,269
same time mostly concurrently I didn't

00:14:48,089 --> 00:15:00,779
want to seem over it too much but

00:14:50,269 --> 00:15:02,220
basically for us and we're spitting it

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,920
out

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,360
should have conditional like there's no

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,640
design we just need to have the

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,470
WordPress admin as done as possible so

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,050
that we can start getting content in and

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,420
as the visual design is then completed

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,490
in the markup and free then you can come

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,470
back to integrate the two together

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,110
and we're doing this with a JavaScript

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,480
PHP in school so like the functional

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:31,560
spec might say we're gonna have a

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:33,510
template for dealers like applying as a

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,890
bunch of dealers and maybe listen in a

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,790
dealer search we're going to need a

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,430
custom post type the dealer and address

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,270
it always needs to people to main and

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,610
they're gonna have a phone number in a

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:47,660
website I'm just gonna make sure we have

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,660
all those fields

00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,630
okay

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:04,419
[Music]

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,279
[Music]

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:20,830
and this again it's a great place to or

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,779
often is a place where you find things

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,029
you can consider in the functional spec

00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:28,270
and also the design so we had a site

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:32,410
recently where the designer had designed

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:34,360
a really nice booking a study and then

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,040
we did the programming and we made it so

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,680
it was like supposed to be just one line

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,990
the client actually wrote two paragraphs

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,640
for that so we had to go back into mind

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,290
the functional spec and say okay

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,260
actually this is going to be a different

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,690
input field the design had to change

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,760
that was like this big and it had to

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:58,120
squeeze it down so moving the content

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:59,680
will also usually just like we get to

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,380
reviewing the dust we need to do an

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,810
all-hands meeting at the end look at our

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:09,300
our checklist and documented and

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,300
actually go through and figure out where

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,870
and during this is if it isn't

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,280
documented

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:23,949
it was never done and we removed and you

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,300
can't charge for that so there's a big

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,339
enough change who want to have that

00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,720
documented so that we can then go back

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,720
and say we need to do so

00:17:40,360 --> 00:18:42,080
so you know email because there's a

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:45,140
change actually so obviously some level

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,350
testing before

00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:53,060
sign there's a bunch of different kinds

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:54,680
of tests that you can do you know wait

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,990
user testing if you have a really

00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,700
awesome budget that's great but some of

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,770
the things that we always typically do

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,570
matter but you browser tests to make

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,470
sure how does it look different devices

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:10,270
different operating system browser

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,270
validation of your code it's huge

00:19:26,560 --> 00:20:06,170
ability and then are you responsible for

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,240
anything because they have their needs

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:12,970
change knowing who's going to be doing

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,970
that work will help you better

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,200
we're gonna host and then it breaks and

00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,999
they call you and you're like well we

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,549
gotta turn you out early and they're

00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:28,320
like cool you build it like you're

00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,029
responsible for it and so you gotta play

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,549
that out pretty early like what what is

00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:34,919
that actually when you build a site take

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:38,369
care of it leaders so we typically only

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,860
work on sites that we maintain which we

00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:42,840
also incentivize in our pricing

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,619
structure science to do that because it

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,700
makes our lives easier you know what our

00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:51,899
system is and you know who has access

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:57,330
basically the only person company does

00:20:51,899 --> 00:21:11,340
FTP access is me so we have deployment

00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:14,690
structures in place okay so this part

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,690
we're gonna sort of talk about

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:34,309
environment we use this changes and

00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:34,309
involves and so hopefully we have time

00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:02,850
[Music]

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,850
I'm sorry

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,289
[Music]

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,119
[Music]

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:33,130
so this is our environment so we host

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:37,770
our sights on wpengine it's a management

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,770
press host they're fantastic they're

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,730
staging servers really quickly staging

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,990
server being a direct copy of their site

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,990
so that in a different environments

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:58,580
and then our machines and hover is what

00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:02,630
we use for domain name registrars so the

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:05,659
main name and a mess 153 and what is

00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:08,649
familiar with that is our DNS or domain

00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:08,649
name server

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,330
anymore performance but it's a little

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:36,850
bit complicated

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:40,480
some people read poetry for the return

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:44,890
for version control the basic or place

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,740
and punch list where we have things that

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,750
we use over and over we build so many

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,830
sites and there are things that we just

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:56,200
keep doing repetitively and so we sort

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,570
of save all of these things up in this

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:05,740
one place so that we can copy and paste

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:07,510
or download every time but you can do

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,000
this at whatever scale you need to do it

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:12,000
but having the predictive

00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,529
but it's wonderful because it allows us

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,480
punch Lass's I forgive you

00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:21,789
carpentry but essentially it's a

00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:27,899
checklist yeah what needs to be done

00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:38,799
like we got a trim we go to the

00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:40,659
carpentry so we use a punch list but

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,980
every time you spin up a site we know

00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:48,159
like I know I'm not entirely sure where

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,630
you are levels of things but like how

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,700
many provisions do we want to have in

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:55,480
place we don't typically want to run as

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,770
many revisions as default so we're

00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,320
always gonna want to change the number

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:05,190
of revisions we're always gonna need to

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:15,730
make sure we have access to the DMS and

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:18,990
then we also have things which is all of

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,990
the debugging things that we need

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,570
but you can do you can construct

00:26:23,780 --> 00:27:02,900
whatever you play which is the things

00:26:27,570 --> 00:27:04,950
that you need that you need and so this

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:15,480
website they have an exchange of

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:19,770
something new so get all the things that

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,870
we do so we're writing the plugins so

00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,850
one of the things that no one can have

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,510
my class structure in a certain way in

00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,510
how standards

00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:35,580
and I have similar scaffold for themed

00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:38,640
front-end development so we use

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:47,549
underscores as our starter teams it's

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:50,970
great functionality there are things

00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:55,039
about underscores that I do differently

00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:58,440
so I to write all my CSS which is

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,690
presentation of the site should look

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,559
like I use a switch is a preprocessor

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:08,070
for CSS I have my own way that I like to

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:14,610
organize my files I have code that I

00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:19,429
reuse so save throw in every time to

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,429
start a new file supporting libraries

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:28,140
getting in the weeds low-thirties bulb

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,860
my gulp setup which helps us it's the

00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,760
same every time

00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,919
pretty much maybe the file directory

00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,840
structure is changing but I just do

00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,140
these things over and over so we set

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,140
them up

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:56,270
and then third birdie plugins if you

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,970
decide secretly have favorite plugins

00:28:56,270 --> 00:30:02,150
they use over and over again these are

00:28:58,970 --> 00:30:03,420
the as we said very customized we we use

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,720
main WP

00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:09,000
we have number of sites so main WP is a

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,770
method for managing and we have a

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,140
security plug-in a theme updates

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:20,160
available other information for all of

00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:22,380
our sites in one dashboard so that helps

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,680
our client order go through and look at

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,240
oh I'm good maintenance this is what

00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,740
actually it was to update people get in

00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,100
one place rather than going through them

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,440
every single say and then Yoast pretty

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,600
everyone's probably fairly familiar with

00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,770
Yoast most of the sites you put it on

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,420
especially because we're doing like

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:58,230
marketing agency work we're doing a

00:30:42,420 --> 00:31:01,230
really small say okay so we talked about

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:03,870
some of the things that we use as a team

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,820
the tools that we do and how we work we

00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,860
just wanted to like take a minute or two

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,960
to talk about these specific software

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,000
that's always my favorite thing when

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,159
people talk about babies so what are you

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,289
actually using for software or how are

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,149
you doing these things I think I

00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:20,700
mentioned are really exhaust if you're

00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:22,889
writing regular CSS you should look into

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:28,230
it it allows you to do some more

00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:31,200
advanced things with CFS you know chunk

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:34,769
up your code and organize it nicely use

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,809
bolt which is a task runner or basically

00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:40,460
you can set it up so you have a bunch of

00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:40,460
tasks that you do over and over again

00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:51,450
rights doing communication from a

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:54,720
JavaScript you just give us for a

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:56,760
repository is github for Mac which is a

00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,059
new interface there ellipses command

00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,330
line and then I use Firefox for my

00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,710
browser and I highly recommend if you're

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,200
just sitting in to developing they

00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,059
always look at the web inspector it has

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,519
so much information it's so up to a

00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:13,519
powerful tool you can learn so much

00:32:39,900 --> 00:33:31,710
because I am midway between the two I

00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:34,270
think that low by five mil is great I

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,540
occasionally have means that they cannot

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,540
meet

00:33:42,100 --> 00:35:03,680
it does is PHP or JavaScript made

00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:06,680
manuals they're all online understanding

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,650
kind of how that manual is organized

00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,269
allow you to debug and do

00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,859
yeah and then it would also just sound

00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:14,450
like there was always something new and

00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:17,420
it's really fun to try new things but

00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:19,730
also don't be afraid to like use

00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,769
whatever works Rio if you're comfortable

00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,720
braiding regular CSS and that works for

00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:31,130
you that's great it'll need to install

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:33,319
this there is a lot of different options

00:35:31,130 --> 00:36:06,980
out there so really sticking you're

00:35:33,319 --> 00:36:08,569
comfortable so this is my part list

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,390
these are some of the highlights that we

00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:14,059
like I care deeply then excessively so

00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:17,599
we're using like web aim which is a

00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:20,450
great little browser extension ax which

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:29,949
is also an accessibility

00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:29,949
[Music]

00:36:43,400 --> 00:37:28,020
powerful tool in chrome and it's going

00:36:51,180 --> 00:37:31,010
to give you which is useful it comes in

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,010
a less

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,840
I would be Android in-house uncheck

00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,650
represent them for Android and then it

00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:44,190
would be on iOS so if I get tablet an

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,660
image if she came back and that worked

00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,180
out really well to always have devices

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:51,560
available because although we used

00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,400
browser stack which is a browser checker

00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:58,140
sometimes it's really him to actually

00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:02,790
have a physical it's different and I'm a

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:07,230
fan of friends and family tasks for me

00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:09,120
and browser stack it's so powerful but

00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:14,820
just see it having someone else will got

00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:16,740
it and even like that yeah and what's my

00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,230
browser is really helpful dot org is

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,140
really helpful for clients that's gonna

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:32,490
send you all the information about what

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:34,500
information is that link it will give

00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,430
them a special link to send back to you

00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,380
and it'll give you very detailed

00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:39,300
information about what version of

00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,250
browser what operating system what size

00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,230
monitor their using do they have

00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,270
JavaScript turned on and that is usually

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:49,340
invaluable because then like browser

00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:49,340
stack spin up a machine

00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,260
[Music]

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,130
[Music]

00:39:09,900 --> 00:40:27,809
okay works for us to do this all the

00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,809
tools that we have sight

00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:24,090
so I set it up a useful there's

00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,549
[Music]

00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,620
[Music]

00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:50,070
so that is great question one of the

00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:54,450
ways that we do that is something that

00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:58,020
we're working on but it's it's a fully

00:41:54,450 --> 00:42:01,020
test for a development shop so this is

00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:04,160
the midway point is Jensen actually goes

00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:07,980
in and she writes PHP which outputs

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,900
static HTML it's in a couple of small

00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,110
variables of things they're gonna come

00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,370
from the admin so advanced system field

00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,020
you need to get something out of that

00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,140
field and then put it smart so she can

00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:20,490
put variables in or that that

00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,500
information from the functional stuff

00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:25,890
and it just returns all the static

00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:32,430
output then I take it and convert it

00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:37,100
into she makes static and it was

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:37,100
standing work and then

00:42:40,109 --> 00:43:02,130
yeah like the other way and I go through

00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,199
