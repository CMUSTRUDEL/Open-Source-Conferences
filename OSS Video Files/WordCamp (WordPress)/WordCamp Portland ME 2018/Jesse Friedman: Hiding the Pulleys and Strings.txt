Description: 
	Personalization, hyper targeting, and segmenting are far from subtle these days. In this session you’ll learn effective marketing techniques to help you actually connect with your users and customers. You’ll see real examples of how I learn about users and do it by providing them with value. We’ll also get hands-on with businesses from the audience discovering real world fair trade marketing opportunities. We’ll identify ways to raise your revenue and make customers happy doing it. And we’ll learn how to create up-sells that actually help users rather than just helping your bottom line.
Let’s stop duplicating the techniques and strategies we see across the Internet. Learn how to listen to your users, they’re already telling you what they need and how to connect with them.
