Title: Jesse Friedman: Hiding the Pulleys and Strings
Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	Personalization, hyper targeting, and segmenting are far from subtle these days. In this session you’ll learn effective marketing techniques to help you actually connect with your users and customers. You’ll see real examples of how I learn about users and do it by providing them with value. We’ll also get hands-on with businesses from the audience discovering real world fair trade marketing opportunities. We’ll identify ways to raise your revenue and make customers happy doing it. And we’ll learn how to create up-sells that actually help users rather than just helping your bottom line.
Let’s stop duplicating the techniques and strategies we see across the Internet. Learn how to listen to your users, they’re already telling you what they need and how to connect with them.

all right so today I'm talking about

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,620
hiding in the pulleys and strings and so

00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,780
actually I was in London in May and I

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,120
was in an air B&B and I saw this first

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,670
edition by Robert Louis Stevenson and a

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,890
book called essays and writing and the

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,750
first paragraph goes as such there is

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,400
nothing more disenchanting to man than

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,590
to be shown the springs and mechanisms

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,650
of any art to all our arts and our key

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,690
occupations lie wholly on the surface it

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,790
is on the surface that we perceive their

00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,890
beauty fitness and significance and a

00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,780
pride below is to be appalled by their

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,829
emptiness and shocked by the courses of

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,780
the strings and police I was just blown

00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:44,449
away by this because of the fact that

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,550
everything I do online is about trying

00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:48,379
to help people understand the value of

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,329
the products that I'm selling the

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:53,929
features that I'm promoting whatever it

00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:56,030
might be and if they knew how much work

00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,609
went into all of this stuff they

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,069
probably wouldn't buy anything so this

00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:02,960
actually spoke to me a lot so this is

00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:04,280
this is what my talk is about and so

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
today what I'm gonna be doing is I'm

00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,270
gonna be giving everybody kind of an

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,790
overview a few different types of

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,619
websites that we're all either managing

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,829
ourselves building for our clients

00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:18,710
whatever it might be and trying to reach

00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:21,560
out to users in what I think is going to

00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,930
be the most important way in which we

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,490
communicate communicate with users in

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,070
the future which is personalized

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,539
messaging if anyone here works as

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,549
automatic you know that I talk about

00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,740
this stuff non-stop to the point where

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,619
people want to just put me out in the

00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,850
street but I think it's the most

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,759
important thing that we can be doing

00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,549
because if you think about the the way

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,329
the internet evolved how many people

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,640
built a website back in like the 90s

00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:50,840
okay and what did you think about when

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,630
you were building a website was it a

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,149
newspaper or a magazine like that kind

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,369
of layout that's where we all came from

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:00,109
right it was an advertising print layout

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,799
that's where the internet kind of like

00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:06,859
leaned on you know what it leaned on for

00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,750
layouts design things like that you look

00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,690
at like advertising billboards on the

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,700
street those are designed to gather as

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,950
many views as possible but they're in no

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,599
'we personalized to the person driving

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,120
down the street although I imagine that

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,530
will change in the future the internet

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,629
though has the ability to personalize

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,220
its messaging for everyone who's

00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,660
arriving at the web site and I think

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,420
that's where we can differentiate

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,989
ourselves and really create a very

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,760
unique experience so I work at automatic

00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,069
if anybody's interested in working with

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,160
me or some of our team members here

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,690
please visit this page if you want to

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,700
talk to me after this you can catch me

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,160
on Twitter that's my handle

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:50,660
that's my blog these are all very

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,000
personalized handles and URLs so when we

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,680
talk about personalization augmenting or

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,260
otherwise changing a design based on

00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,880
specific users intent and the intent is

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,209
the thing that I like to point out to

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,310
people you know you may be a man or a

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,319
woman but you might be shopping

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,209
specifically for clothes for your spouse

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,099
on a website right so it's not

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,069
necessarily about what it is that you

00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:16,099
need or how you fill a demographic poll

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:20,660
but it's what the intent is for you on

00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:22,310
that website at that time if you're

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,889
interested there's a really great talk

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,500
about two hours ago that you can see by

00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,790
Jeff Galinski it will be online and the

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,230
slides are online but I would definitely

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,600
view this slide because it's a great

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,880
precursor so if you can't go back in

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,319
time totally understand go check this

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,319
this presentation out

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,879
all right so today's word of the day is

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,010
confidence and the reason for that is

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,440
because a lot of what users do and the

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,760
decisions they make on your website is

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,489
based off the confidence that they will

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,500
receive the information the content or

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,349
the solution that they need at that

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,560
moment I'll give you a good example this

00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:02,819
is the hotel I'm staying in right now

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:08,010
yesterday I was packing to come up here

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:10,769
to me and my wife asked me if we should

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,269
pack a bathing suit is there a pool all

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,640
right so I don't know I went to their

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,310
website and it's a little hard to see

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,419
but the top URL links our overview

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:25,860
photos rooms deals spa dining fitness

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:28,350
local area map meetings and weddings so

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,310
how do I find out there's a pool what do

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,440
you think I clicked on spa and photos I

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,910
asked like five people before I walked

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,410
in here and those are the two main

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,190
answers and that's mostly what I heard

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,169
just now so if I click on spa this is

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,780
what I get and it's a picture of a

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,580
massage chair and if you scroll around

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,950
you learn nothing about whether or not

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,160
they have a pool so then I went to

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,720
photos and the thing is this is that my

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,190
wife who has a travel degree said you

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,690
click on amenities well there's no

00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,400
amenities link even if they had an

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,620
amenities link I don't know that I click

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,750
it because the thing is that it's not

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,389
just about whether or not they have a

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,860
pool it's about the end result for me is

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,990
finding out if they have a pool that I

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:14,160
want to swim in right because I don't

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,200
want to end up in one of these and I've

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,960
been to hotels where they have a four by

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,960
four pool and it's just a cold hot tub

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,560
so the the lesson I'm trying to instill

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,050
here is that at the end of the day the

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,850
word pool on a checklist of things that

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,950
they have doesn't actually answer the

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,140
question for me right I'm trying to

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,400
understand with confidence what I'm

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,930
clicking on is going to get me the

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,640
result that I want which is why I went

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,130
to photos versus than a list of

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,910
amenities all right so what

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,860
personalization isn't convenience a lot

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,780
of times people think that I'll make

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,030
this experience better but I'll make it

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,610
faster I'll eliminate steps and I'm

00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,280
personalizing that experience the thing

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,320
is is that we all want convenience so

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,480
it's not personalized to me that I want

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,020
convenience unless you this person who

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,340
takes an iMac to a Starbucks and just to

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:15,190
prove that I can just grab this off the

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:18,370
internet that's me and that's a person

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,670
who literally carried a 27-inch iMac

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:26,020
to a Boston Starbucks yes

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:28,450
my wife's actually like right here so

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,700
unless you're this person who cares very

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,800
little about convenience if we all care

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,600
about convenience so it's not a

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,940
personalized experience to make your

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:42,670
website a convenient one I also have

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,750
amazing design skills but one thing I'd

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,260
like to point out to you that good

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,180
design is not a personalized experience

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,920
making it look better is a great

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,570
experience that we all want but again

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,870
it's the same thing as convenience we

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,370
all expect a good design it doesn't

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,960
personalize it for me if you've done a

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,170
great job designing your website it's

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,940
just what I expect these companies in

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:07,060
particular though have done in a really

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,660
amazing job personalizing things Netflix

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,480
is showing you guys hundreds of

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,680
thousands of hours of video that you

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,510
would never have found on your own

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,580
because they show it to you in a

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,100
convenient well timed real time manner

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,680
they base it off of things that you've

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,380
watched something that they do really

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,810
really well is their profiles how many

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,430
people utilize the profiling and Netflix

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,560
yeah okay

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,430
so my son has a very different profile

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,070
than I do

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,889
I'm watching American Horror Story and I

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,470
hope to god he's not hit more kid

00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,729
related but the reason for the profiling

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,729
is because of the fact that it allows

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:47,680
them to personalize the results for you

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:51,090
in the future and it doesn't create some

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,090
big mess of things

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,789
real-time personalization or

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,590
personalization in general doesn't have

00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,729
to be super hard work either and you

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,389
guys can see I have a Sesame Street

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,199
green Kermit the Frog theme going here

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,030
so today what we're going to talk about

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,130
is opportunities for you to personalize

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,620
the websites you're working on and these

00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,690
are little stepping stones these are

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,530
opportunities for you to break into this

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,820
realm and do a good job of it and then

00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,460
hopefully you'll get the bug and you'll

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,960
want to do it all the time all right so

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,419
the first thing I want to know is who's

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,910
visiting your site what is their intent

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:28,210
and what is the value to you what is the

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,289
value of that intent so we're gonna look

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,789
at a couple different websites today

00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,700
we're gonna look at a blog a restaurant

00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:35,289
ecommerce site and a SAS site when you

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,680
arrive at a web site this is what you

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:40,779
look like

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:44,110
to me you are a number you're a neighbor

00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:47,290
on a device and I might be lucky enough

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,850
to have your location but these pieces

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,290
of information are enough for me to

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,420
really start building a personalized

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,120
profile and to start customizing the

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,279
content for you alright so some of the

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,709
things that I really love location

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,860
device weather that they're a returning

00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:04,690
user and if you can get them to log in

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,520
that's like the gold standard because

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,220
then you can track all that information

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,830
about them and understand their use case

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:16,180
on your website much longer all right so

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:19,029
let's take a look at the block goals for

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,950
me I want people to subscribe I want

00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:24,940
people to comment I want people to share

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,010
and I want people to stay I'm gonna make

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:32,080
fun of a website today this is my wife's

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:33,490
website sorry joy yeah I know I gotta go

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,470
home

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:42,790
all right so that's true under your

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:46,540
guidance all right so here's a blog and

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,040
I arrived here at this page probably

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,899
through some google search or something

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,269
that I did or somebody shared a link

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,129
with me on Facebook you'll see that

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:56,559
there's a subscribe via email on the

00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:59,160
right there if she's connected her

00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,179
social media profiles which is great

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,410
let's take a look at that subscribe

00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:07,059
email right now is it personalized I

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,790
have an email address how many people

00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:14,110
here have an email address

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:16,480
it is not personalized but if I get you

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,730
the comment I get some information from

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,350
you I can start to profile that

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,480
information and start to customize

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,790
things from you the same thing goes for

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,790
comments though it's not personalized at

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,589
this moment and and you could be leaving

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,059
any information you want but this is one

00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:32,740
of the goals right so we said subscribe

00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:34,839
we said comments these are the tools

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,149
that we have at our disposal sharing

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,459
these are the sharing icons from jetpack

00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:40,839
very easy to turn on and then I can

00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:45,189
click those links and I can share those

00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:48,189
icons at the bottom of her posts we have

00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:50,199
a related posts area which is great for

00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,329
increasing engagement and we have a

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:54,939
categorization area and then these are

00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:57,160
tags these little tag looking things or

00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,839
tags these are all things that are built

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,249
into WordPress that we can start to

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,480
utilize today to improve personalization

00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:06,009
so what you want to do is when you're

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,480
arriving at the website when these users

00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:08,649
are coming to you you want to listen to

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,689
them and the thing is is that a lot of

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,920
people don't understand this but all of

00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:14,110
the things that are built into WordPress

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,819
right now will teach you something about

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:21,369
your users so in this case I arrived at

00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:23,980
the same website but it's an article

00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:27,970
about our mates and the fact that our

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,699
son has a very deep you know bad allergy

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:33,999
to peanuts and some of the things that

00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:36,490
we do to kind of like accommodate him so

00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:38,799
as a user arriving on that page what do

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,529
I know about that user well the fact

00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:44,620
that every single post on your website

00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:45,430
is a home page teaches you something so

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,029
what

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,920
I arrived on what did I come to that's

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:53,130
all information that helps me understand

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,450
and start to profile this user it's

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,640
probably not the case that I just

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,700
happened to stumble as this is the first

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,920
page like at a chance because of the

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,510
fact that if I clicked on it from a

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,209
Google search or I clicked on it from a

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,790
social area they're probably the a the

00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,560
thing in my mind is that I had intent to

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,080
learn more about eller mates and

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,610
allergies right so at that moment you

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,399
can start to profile that user a little

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,959
bit better questions you can start to

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,370
ask yourself within WordPress right now

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:24,279
did they scroll all the way down to the

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,690
bottom of the page if so then how much

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,050
time did they spend on the page did they

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,450
read the whole article there are ways in

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,130
which you can put little pieces like

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,330
cookies at the bottom of a page you can

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,070
start to see whether or not images

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,550
loaded at the bottom of page things like

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,070
that how long did they stay did they

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,510
perform any searches this is very easy

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,220
for you to use so any kind of like

00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,050
Google Analytics or jetpack search will

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,970
tell you or jetpack stats will tell you

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,700
if people are searching did they click

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,320
on the categories or tags again

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,670
categories and tags are so underutilized

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,110
because of the fact that they're labeled

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,470
and they tell you exactly what the user

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,660
is clicking on and and and gives you a

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,709
broader range of what to write on you

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,150
should definitely be looking at that

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:06,760
because that's intent and that's what's

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,930
you're telling people you want they

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,029
they're telling you what they want you

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,660
to write more about did they share and

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:18,640
did they comment so ways to personalize

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:20,560
that that subscribe widget what if I

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,540
just changed the content to say don't

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,160
miss out on allergy related posts

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,810
because the fact that they arrived on

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,060
that allergy related post its

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,640
categorized as an allergy related post

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,410
that's already the all the information I

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,060
need all I need to do is swap out the

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,220
content the title of that subscription

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,410
widget with the category name and I've

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,770
already personalized it a bit more for

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,000
that customer or that user the problem

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,290
here with this website is we're out

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,579
saying I'm making fun of my wife a

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,680
little bit here is that she didn't

00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:48,720
categorize this

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,999
posts so something to keep in mind

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,279
definitely always be categorizing your

00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:54,809
posts and tagging them because it's all

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,100
information that you're leaving out in

00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:57,329
the wild that you're not you're not

00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,949
gaining anything from because if

00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:00,509
everybody arrives in an uncharacterrized

00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:04,050
post then you're not learning anything

00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,660
about it did everybody know here that

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,819
every single category can be subscribed

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,220
to on WordPress so if you are writing

00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:12,600
like me about six different subjects

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,490
that are wildly different sometimes I

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,809
write about hikes I'm going on with my

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,360
family I'm writing about personalization

00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:21,029
books that I've written every single

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,009
category you can type in slash feed at

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:25,679
the end of that category or tag and

00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:27,839
you'll get a specific RSS feed just for

00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,670
that category of tag and then that way

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,230
that user can subscribe to just that

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,709
information personalizing their

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,209
experience

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:37,290
remember with comments you're getting

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,059
their email address and their

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,610
information so this is an opportunity

00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:43,319
for you to follow up remind them of what

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,959
they did on your site thank them for

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:49,410
commenting recap their visit give them

00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,540
quick share links so thanks for visiting

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,569
my website so you commented on this URL

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,829
this blog post here's a few links so you

00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,089
can share it on Facebook with your

00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,679
friends because obviously you cared a

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:01,410
little bit about it and here's a few

00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,939
other URLs or blog posts that you'd be

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,379
interested in there's no reason you

00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:07,019
can't email people who comment on your

00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,999
site and I guarantee you that 90% of you

00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,569
probably don't do it right now so it's a

00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:14,970
great opportunity for everybody if

00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:17,220
anybody's ever getting a 404 or

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,649
searching site and not getting answers

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,509
this is another opportunity I typed in

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:25,019
the word gluten on my wife's website and

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,620
the word gluten showed no results so I

00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,420
can actually oh and if you're looking

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,519
for an improvement on the left on search

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,120
checkout jetpacks elasticsearch that's

00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,679
my promo I'll skip it keep going so

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,269
search gives you intent what you're

00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,970
missing and an opportunity to reach out

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:44,189
instead of having a blank page ask for

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,110
them to sign up to see posts that are

00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:47,999
written about gluten in the future that

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,009
way they have an opportunity to come

00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,019
back to your website you are giving them

00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,429
an opportunity to learn more and you

00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:57,360
getting an opportunity to reach out to

00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:58,150
them we're one-fourth of the way through

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,300
I'm

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,800
as fast as I can for whatever reason

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,560
instead of checkmarks I decided to do

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,990
pac-man eating lightning bolts so we've

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,490
done blogs on to restaurants I like to

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,730
pick on restaurant websites because I

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,040
think every restaurant website could be

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:19,180
so much easier but what are the goals of

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,610
a restaurant website look at that it's

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,060
like you read my mind

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:27,370
call it directions make a reservation

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,800
not a time on site this is important the

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,390
blog the goal for the blog was to keep

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,560
you on the site keep you engaged keep

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,380
you reading posts that you're sharing

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,320
the goal for a restaurant website is not

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,940
time on site I want you off of that

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,500
website as fast as possible because I

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,110
want you to get off the website and come

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,720
into the restaurant right so there's

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,760
only a few reasons that you're coming

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,290
this is a restaurant in Boston that my

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,240
wife and I go to all the time

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,130
it's called popper I love this

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,900
restaurant the food's amazing their

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,540
restaurant website is actually not that

00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,980
bad it's very easy to scroll to the

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,380
bottom you learn about their locations

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:07,030
there are hours all the information that

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:10,240
I could possibly need but if my location

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:13,600
is shared and I'm the user at the top

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,580
there and I'm 500 miles away and I'm the

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,920
user who's within 10 minutes we can

00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:22,209
start to craft a content based solution

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,330
for those two different individuals

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,589
right so maybe for the person who's 500

00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,880
miles away they're more interested in a

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,680
reservation because they're not coming

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,660
in in the next two hours right they

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,300
physically cannot make it there unless

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,160
they're transporting somehow but

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,160
somebody who's within 10 minutes what

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
about a proximity coupon uses coupon in

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,880
the next 30 minutes for a free appetizer

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,990
that gets that customer to walk past

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,000
every other restaurant they're gonna

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,100
walk down on that street and use that

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,830
coupon and come in and and come in there

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,060
this is very simple there are tons of

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,550
wordpress plugins that allow you to

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,170
customize content based on locations so

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,740
all you have to do is just use their IP

00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,120
or ask them to share their location

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,250
html5 when that came out it made it so

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,040
easy to use this kind of content and and

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:09,680
start to customize things so instead of

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,630
a pop-up that shows them the

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,320
make a reservation maybe resent them

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:19,850
with a coupon all right

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:22,460
more Pakman ecommerce goals obviously

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:26,120
make the sale you know you want to get

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,910
their email Amazon is probably the best

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,010
e-commerce shop in the world you type in

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:35,930
Google home they give you recommended

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:38,480
solutions they give you answers or you

00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,370
know choices that are based off of your

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,930
previous experiences with them things

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,660
that you've purchased in the past all

00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:50,000
that but there's little things that you

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,950
can do this is the automatic hires page

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,480
we're actually hiring for someone called

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,370
a remote controller I'm not gonna

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,320
pretend to know what that is but if you

00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,000
arrive at this page enough we have a

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,230
little thing here that says hey there

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,300
couldn't help but notice that you

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,220
visited this page a few times looks like

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,920
you're really thinking about this or if

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,750
working here click here to apply right

00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,240
so when you're running an e-commerce

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,640
shop keep track of how many times

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,980
somebody's viewing a product before

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,010
they've purchased some customers I

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,020
forget the percentage overall but we've

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,640
looked into this and and and it's

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,830
something that's very common if you read

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,110
about making the sale and e-commerce

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,610
shops there are some customers who will

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,470
literally just not buy anything unless

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,810
they're given a discount so they might

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,270
view multiple times because they've been

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,410
trained by so many e-commerce shops that

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,990
they should have a coupon or discount

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,550
before they make a decision so this is

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,910
an opportunity for you to give them that

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:46,940
discount so here's a just a random

00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:49,910
shopping cart for a backpack I'm

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,740
purchasing it and maybe I viewed this

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,440
page a half a million times

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,240
I haven't actually pulled the trigger

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,370
boom there's a pop-up that says take ten

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,380
percent off today sometimes it's the

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,480
little tiny nudge that you need to get

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,820
them to make the commitment to actually

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,480
purchase and you guys can't actually see

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,760
that Kenya all right so that actually

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,420
says pull the trigger with ten percent

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,820
off and there's surprise this is so

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,780
washed out I'm sorry about that have you

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,140
guys been missing like half my

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,780
presentation

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,130
okay alright so the first one okay Mary

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,570
cart abandonment is a big thing so

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,340
anytime that you can learn anything

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,790
about customers take that information

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,620
and run with it a lot of clients people

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,420
don't know this but like if you submit

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,520
parts of a form you can take that

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,620
information and use it to your benefit

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,930
right so if you have a multi-step

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,400
checkout process this is actually really

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,220
beneficial to you because of the fact

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,960
that you think that a single page

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,550
checkout process would be really

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,680
beneficial because it gets them moving

00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,850
through the whole flow faster but the

00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,010
thing is that you can't really collect

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,710
any information at that point so if

00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,240
they're abandoning the cart I guess you

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,620
could technically start submitting

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,880
information as they're filling it out on

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,890
the form but that's a level of

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,080
creepiness I'm not willing to to get to

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,460
you just yet but as those individual

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,020
steps are submitted they're technically

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,520
submitting that information to you so

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,440
you can actually harness that

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,360
information to retarget those customers

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,160
so if you have a three-step checkout

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,260
process and the first step is name an

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,760
email then you can start to grab those

00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,100
emails put them into a bucket add

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,480
coupons to their their email lists tell

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,160
them about new features about the

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,060
product and continue to sell to them

00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,290
coolest thing about email that I don't

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,790
think a lot of people are benefiting

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,700
from right now is that if you have an

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,950
email like this with a coupon in it I'll

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,440
go back like if you've seen an email

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,540
like this we you're given the coupon and

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,450
it's just not the right time for you you

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:49,260
have no desire to buy I don't know what

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:51,420
it jairs I guess but maybe you need

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,920
chairs I don't know how many chairs you

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:57,060
need but maybe you need chairs in like a

00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,830
month you might go and type in the name

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,680
of that company and see all the old

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,480
coupons right which might be expired

00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,950
here's the thing when somebody views an

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,660
old email if you're using anything

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,880
modern like MailChimp or Constant

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,520
Contact anything that there are tracking

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,860
pixels inside those emails they give you

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,860
an opportunity to say hey this person's

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,990
open that email and it's in a month old

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,510
it's an expired coupon it is useless to

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,100
them right now so why not just send them

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,920
the same email again with an active

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,290
coupon right so you're tracking at that

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,680
moment and you're sending them

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:35,870
Time email live which is highly

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,050
personalized and very effective for your

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,940
campaigns so you're turning old emails

00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,550
into new emails which is definitely a

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:47,150
good thing to look into I love the idea

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,530
of second second chances so if you're if

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,240
you've given up on a retargeting

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,940
campaign if you've done a drip campaign

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,270
and it's just not working try hitting

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,130
them up again any time they show any any

00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,810
interest at all and look at all the

00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,550
areas in which you're reaching out to

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,470
them and ways in which you can re-engage

00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:06,310
with them a lot of times people focus

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,510
just on the website but if they're

00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,390
commenting on something on social media

00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,830
if they're opening an old email all

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,710
these are opportunities for you to

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:18,770
re-engage alright so we looked at blogs

00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,940
restaurants ecommerce and sass and I'm

00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,010
trying to move quickly because I want to

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,630
leave time for comments and for

00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,650
everybody to get safely across the

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:30,280
street for lunch goals for Southside is

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:36,350
making the sale getting the email again

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:38,510
this is a personalized engine that I

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:42,050
built at a previous company with the

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,370
help of actually Jeff velinski what we

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,840
were doing is selling insurance

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,520
the most boring thing in the world but

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,230
the cool thing about insurance is that

00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,900
most people need multiple types of

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,970
insurance so you can learn based off

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,800
their location the things that they're

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,020
interested in what they're visiting on

00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,410
the page and I like to use this example

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:04,160
because of the fact that it's it's

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,630
actually prime but it translates to a

00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,730
lot of different areas in which you can

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,470
benefit from this stuff so the first

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:14,570
thing the first area where I touched on

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:18,560
personalization this was 7 years ago we

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:21,470
had insurance industry sites that had 10

00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,510
12 15 locations and so what we started

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,790
doing was sorting the locations based

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,950
off of where you were standing at that

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,960
moment with your phone or where you were

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,550
on your computer and we would sort them

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,650
in order of distance from you at that

00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,000
moment because the reality situation is

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,290
that insurance is all like the

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,670
restaurant website the only reason

00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,930
you're looking for the locations is you

00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,540
need a phone number you need to go to

00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:43,670
that location at that exact moment

00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,960
this was highly relevant to them so they

00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,490
could just at any moment see the

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,170
location that was places to them this is

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,870
the first area where I really kind of

00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,860
like touched on personalization but then

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,410
we started getting a little bit deeper

00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,030
and here's the thing you might arrive at

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,470
an insurance website because you need

00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,850
auto insurance you're buying a new car

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,040
today and you need to have it insured

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:03,110
before you roll it off the lot while

00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,360
you're visiting this page though you may

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,550
tell me personally through a form

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,680
submission or something else nothing

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:13,310
about all the other interests needs that

00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:17,900
you have but if I'm clicking on Life

00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:20,030
umbrella renters motorcycle ATV I can

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:23,600
capture all of that information about

00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:25,760
you bundle it up and then ship it with a

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,440
submission of the form when you actually

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,290
send it so this is something to think

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,090
about what we're constantly

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:34,400
personalizing experiences using cookies

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,960
right grabbing different locations on

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,090
what you're doing on a site what

00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,250
products you're viewing right and story

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,200
it on your site on your in your cookies

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,180
so that when you arrive back at the site

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,920
it's personalized for whatever it is

00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,110
that you didn't buy or whatever you

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,640
might need there's no one reason you

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,130
can't take all that information and

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,110
submit it through a form so if I decide

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,630
to click on motorcycle insurance because

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,760
I own a motorcycle then I go to auto

00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,010
because I need auto insurance today and

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,230
I fill out a form for a quote

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,880
there's no reason it's not past that

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,010
information that I looked at motorcycle

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,300
insurance that insurance agent gets on

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,340
the phone and says hey just so you know

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,620
we also have motorcycle insurance and if

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:16,670
you bundle those together today you'll

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,950
save 10% really personalized messaging

00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,870
for that person in real time it's an

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:24,140
opportunity for them and it really

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:26,960
touches on something that's really

00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,740
something like that I want to build an

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,080
entire following around which is called

00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,940
fair trade marketing it's a term that

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,440
I'm trying to use more and more because

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,690
I want people to do it because I think

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,260
that we've built our entire advertising

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:44,690
and marketing world on very fragile

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,370
pillars if you go to Amazon right now

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,490
and you search for a backpack then you

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:52,040
go to a new site or a sports site or

00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,510
whatever blog you're going to that

00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,130
pack is not following you around right

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,720
and it's driving you nuts and you don't

00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,340
even wanna and sometimes you even buy

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,800
the backpack and they think you need six

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,480
more backpacks something I touch on with

00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,430
personalization is that like there are

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,720
some products that you need multiple

00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,940
versions of them you need to keep buying

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,530
it like a food item or something like

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:14,180
that you want to keep going but a

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,520
ceiling fan for a bathroom is something

00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,710
I purchased from Amazon recently I don't

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,660
need twelve ceiling fans for bathrooms

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,240
so I bought one I don't need you to keep

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,820
advertised up to me on that so when we

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,810
touch on fair trade and I'll kind of

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,960
talk about this in some of the

00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,840
onboarding stuff and like I said you can

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,410
email this stuff to you but think about

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,330
opportunities where you can trade value

00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,710
to the customer for the information

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,710
they're giving you so like in this

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,540
example you're actually if you know more

00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,040
about them and you're in a position

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,840
where you don't want to upsell to them

00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:51,260
because people have just passed that

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,450
whole car salesman type situation if you

00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,830
can do a fair trade where I learn a

00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,500
little bit about you based off your

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,790
browser history on my site I can give

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,040
you a discount I can make your

00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,730
experience better right that's a fair

00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,510
trade same thing goes with onboarding

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,250
one of the things we've built at

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,650
automatic is called jetpack onboarding

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:12,290
this entire onboarding flow helps you

00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,990
build a wordpress website faster we use

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:18,170
a metric called time to live it actually

00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:21,350
helps you go from a vanilla WordPress

00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:23,300
install to a live site four hundred

00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,280
percent faster and it just as little

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,700
things to help you along the way but

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,220
every single question is a fair trade if

00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,830
I ask you are you building a business or

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,200
personal website I am now profiling your

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,640
website trying to understand what kind

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,710
of site you're building and then

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,690
exchange I'm gonna give you more tools

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,370
so if you select business I might ask

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,740
you if you need a map on your website

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,570
then I can give you a map in one click

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,030
rather than having you try to figure out

00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:52,190
how to install a plug-in and copy and

00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:54,230
paste the shortcode in bed and do all

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,440
these things I can just trade that with

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,820
you if you're doing a personal site I

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,900
might ask you more questions about blogs

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,460
or themes or things like that the other

00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,120
thing to remember and I kind of touched

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,390
on this

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,520
don't back yourself into a corner and

00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,470
this is the example I just gave so I

00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,630
kind of spoke a little bit ahead but

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:19,250
there are definitely some products here

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:22,310
that you don't need to buy 15 of I

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,230
talked about the ceiling fan and also

00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:26,870
don't do a really bad job of

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,640
personalization just in general I don't

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,800
know what happened to Amazon's algorithm

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,690
here but in this screenshot I actually

00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,630
had to block something out I don't know

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:38,240
if you can see it right here but it was

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:40,130
women's wear that had absolutely nothing

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,840
to do with any of the other products on

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:46,490
this page and so you know I definitely

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,770
encourage people to test and do fun

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,450
things with personalization it's

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,030
definitely an opportunity for you to

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,790
grab small segments of your customers do

00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:58,130
a/b test try some things out but just be

00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,840
smart don't offer me lingerie when my

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:05,740
last browsing history with ceiling fans

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:09,470
and like car mechanic stuff also with

00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:11,990
with convenience and good design don't

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,210
make the experience so poor for a user

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,710
that they can't actually benefit from it

00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:21,650
this is the MBTA app I was trying to get

00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:24,140
a train out of Boston and I needed one

00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,790
for about nine hours from the time when

00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,790
I was browsing but they wouldn't

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:30,980
actually show me more than three of the

00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,210
next train rides so they thought they

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,030
were doing something fun and

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,790
personalized that I must need a train

00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:39,980
ticket right now so that means I need it

00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,780
within the next three hours so they only

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,000
showed me trains within the next three

00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,070
hours there was no pagination and no way

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,140
for me to do anything else so I had to

00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:52,130
actually use the desktop site to buy a

00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:54,020
train ticket for multiple hours in the

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,180
future so just keep that in mind too

00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,900
don't back yourself into a corner don't

00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,310
limit accessibility content or you know

00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,050
the ability for customers to actually

00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:06,170
browse your content because of

00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:07,290
personalization and that's it that's all

00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:13,380
I got

00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:22,790
I try to leave time for questions I

00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:26,190
think we have like seven minutes yeah so

00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:27,750
just basic tracking is a great tool so

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,070
if you're like I said if you're using

00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,600
any kind of WordPress stuff and you're

00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,960
trying to get really basic stuff out of

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,470
customers taking a look if you do a

00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,140
really great content architecture build

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,990
up right and you know categories and

00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,030
tags are applied well if you're running

00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,800
an e-commerce shop if you define those

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:49,590
products into categories and things like

00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,140
that then just basic stats will help you

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,450
a huge amount you actually mentioned in

00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,950
your talk hot jar I love hot jar for

00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,290
anybody who doesn't know hot draw offers

00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,600
a few different things heat mapping is

00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,430
one of them the other tool that hot jar

00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,550
offers that's pretty much my favorite is

00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:08,430
a live real-time one or two questions

00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:10,230
survey and it's super easy it just pops

00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,940
up at the bottom and you can just ask

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,780
them a simple question and don't be

00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,340
afraid to ask questions like this like I

00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,560
would be bold if we're looking at that

00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,810
ecommerce site again and the person's

00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,770
view just a product three or four times

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,110
but they haven't pulled the trigger

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,390
don't be afraid to ask them would you

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,800
have bought this with a discount if I

00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,390
gave you a coupon today would you be

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,620
buying this product don't be afraid to

00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,750
ask those types of questions it's not

00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,820
going to hurt anything and your users

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,740
will actually respect it one thing that

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,930
we actually touched on and just talk was

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,910
that marketing isn't bad or evil and

00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,410
people are fully aware of it happening

00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,030
all around them as long as you're not

00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,580
disingenuous or trying to hide things

00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:49,080
from people then you're going to you're

00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,400
gonna pay them the respect that they

00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,980
deserve and you kind of get back into

00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,010
that fair trade area and I think that

00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,160
that goes a long way so those are two or

00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:02,150
three things that I like to use any

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,150
other questions yeah

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:17,380
yeah so the question - sir everybody

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:20,250
heard it was where's the fine line with

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,250
a creepiness factor

00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:26,020
there's a famous I think it was a

00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,210
politician who actually said it like I

00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,020
can't define pornography but I know it

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:33,190
when I see it

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:35,860
great yeah so it's kind of the same

00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,080
thing you'll know if it's creepy if

00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,030
somebody half fills out a form and they

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,680
give you their address their physical

00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,300
address and you knocked on the door and

00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,520
tried to sell them insurance that's

00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,410
creepy

00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:50,350
but you know I think the further we get

00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:51,760
into the future the the more people are

00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,320
open to these things so when I was

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,420
playing with personalization that

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,760
question actually came up more and more

00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,260
frequently it's far less now

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,210
because I think people are a little bit

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,310
more used to it the other thing that I

00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,880
would really encourage you to do is do

00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:09,760
not be afraid to the customer to

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,430
personalize things they actually at this

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,530
point in time in 2018 they're used to it

00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:16,330
and they're comfortable knowing that

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,580
they're gonna train the website to do

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,920
the things that they want it to do so

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:23,620
you know five years ago asking for their

00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,720
location was like whoa you know that's

00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,310
weird that's creepy right or knowing

00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,350
where they were just saying like hey by

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,340
the way there's a Starbucks three three

00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,080
minutes from you would you like me to

00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,270
order you a latte your favorite latte

00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,230
the latte you ordered last week that's

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,300
creepy

00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,860
but now it's a lot better right it's a

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,140
lot more people are a lot more used to

00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,150
it so I would just say like just be open

00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:45,130
with them be transparent try the

00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,530
Fairtrade kind of thing in your mind

00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:49,150
that like I'm gonna do something for you

00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:52,240
on behalf of you sharing something with

00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,020
me and just don't try to be Shady about

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,850
it

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,890
and don't be afraid to test it you know

00:34:54,850 --> 00:35:04,050
and I think you'll be able to draw that

00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:04,050
line for yourself yeah

00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:23,579
yeah so gdpr is a great example of kind

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,750
of like the entire out like we push

00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,700
things too far this is what I was saying

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:29,369
that like we've built all our marketing

00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:32,069
all of our audience attractive stuff on

00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:33,270
fragile pillars and gdpr I think is a

00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:34,500
reaction to that because of the fact

00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,300
that we've gone too far with

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,119
personalization or grabbing people's

00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,109
privacy data private data and using it

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,690
to our advantage

00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:44,910
the thing about GDP are though is that

00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,040
it's it doesn't make anything that we

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,880
talked about illegal or that you can't

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,829
actually do it

00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,470
GDP are it's about being completely

00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:56,069
transparent and open with the user which

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,240
is just as simple as a little tag at the

00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:58,920
bottom of the site when you arrive

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,270
saying I accept to these terms and

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,710
conditions and these are the things that

00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,420
I'm gonna be tracking while you're here

00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,220
and as I said like the more transparent

00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,440
you are the more comfortable customers

00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,030
are with that stuff and then it's really

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,310
about like when the user gives up and

00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,270
they don't want your product anymore

00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,790
showing them and proving to them that

00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,970
you can delete everything or showing

00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,349
them if they make the request with gdpr

00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,520
compliancy you have to be able to show

00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:22,800
them everything that you've tracked

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,420
about them on a personal level but the

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,510
thing is is that like you don't have to

00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,089
I don't need to know your name to do a

00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:34,050
lot of this tracking if I know that you

00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:36,270
visited the peanut allergy category on

00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,310
my site right and so I want to show you

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,109
more peanut allergy related things I

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,270
don't need to know your name your email

00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:43,740
and and all that private information to

00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:46,710
be able to do that you can still be

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:49,109
completely gdpr compliant so the big

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,849
things that I took away from the work

00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:53,160
that I did on gdpr compliancy at

00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:55,980
automatic and with our lawyers was just

00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,930
being overly transparent be completely

00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,970
you know aware of what it is that you're

00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,530
tracking and make sure that customers

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,390
know that they can review that if they

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,599
want to and then delete it if they have

00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,599
to

00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:17,400
no but gdpr is global something

00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:19,319
protection forget its privacy data

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,339
privacy protection and it's a

00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:25,259
european-based act that went into law in

00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:28,009
europe but i would imagine it being

00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:31,009
spread out across the world over time

00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:31,009
yeah

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,039
[Music]

00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,369
yeah so yeah so the Terms of Service one

00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,800
is that if your terms of service is huge

00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:52,210
if it's a book make it as human readable

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,100
as possible

00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,140
be very clear don't be afraid to like

00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,670
outline in your terms service I'm gonna

00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,260
track your location I'm gonna attract

00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,540
what you fill out on the form things

00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,310
like that but then when you get smaller

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,840
and more granular with it like the

00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,100
browser notifications do a lot of the

00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,350
health for you if you want somebody's

00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,869
location chrome will pop up a little

00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:13,330
window do you want to share the location

00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:15,610
or do you want to do notifications live

00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,860
notifications of updated content chrome

00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,660
will pop up a browser right but usually

00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,940
that comes after you saying it's

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:24,190
initiated by something so it's like you

00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,830
pop up a window that says like we'll

00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,510
sort these for you these locations for

00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,250
you based on your location share the

00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,470
location you hit yes then chrome will

00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,000
ask you and you hit yes again those

00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,410
types of little tiny things are very

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,300
granular and specific to the

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,530
personalized information that you want

00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,530
so those are good examples

00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,520
yeah that's that's the weirdness about

00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,740
the GDP our law is that like if they

00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,089
don't agree to it you have to keep like

00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,650
showing it to them because you really

00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:12,970
the only other option is that they

00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,470
dismiss it which means you kind of have

00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,020
to like turn off all of your marketing

00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,760
and and every other tool forever so

00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,980
every marketer is gonna choose to keep

00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,579
that up until you agree to it for sure

00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,579
yeah

00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,500
yeah

00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:48,109
I don't think that's creepy at all so

00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:49,849
the question was if you're our

00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:52,429
manufacturing site selling parts like

00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:54,139
would you the user benefit from both

00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:55,909
discounts and how would you show that to

00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:58,459
them would it be creepy the thing that I

00:39:55,909 --> 00:40:00,499
would remind you though is that it's

00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:02,659
important to kind of classify that in

00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:04,519
real time so if I'm just browsing your

00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:05,419
site I might be browsing it because I

00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:07,639
want to know more about your

00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:09,229
manufacturing standards than the actual

00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,849
products that you're selling at that

00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:12,469
moment right so offering me a bulk

00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:14,869
discount at that moment may not be

00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:17,149
helpful if I however I'm adding

00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:20,029
additional products like if I'm typing

00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:21,109
in one two or I'm trying to type in 20

00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:22,789
and it doesn't even fit or something

00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,439
like that that's a great opportunity to

00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:26,599
have a little pop up and say something

00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:28,729
like if you're looking for more of these

00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:32,229
we have a bulk discount add 15 more and

00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:32,229
you get 10% off that kind of thing

00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:43,789
absolutely yeah I love questions like

00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:45,229
that if you do then again it goes back

00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:47,719
to the fair trade marketing if you're

00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:50,149
asking a question are you gonna need a

00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:52,099
hundred of these if so we can give you a

00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:53,959
discount or a lot of times what I see is

00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:55,429
that they you end up going into like a

00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:56,509
sales funnel with a sales person or

00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:59,509
something like that because it's a

00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:00,979
bigger product line but either way do

00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:03,319
not be afraid to ask questions like that

00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:04,639
at the very least I mean worst case

00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:05,839
scenario they dismiss it but at the very

00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,359
least you're learning about that

00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:11,119
customer in real time and if 90% of

00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:12,499
their customers say no then that's a

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,649
marketing opportunity for you to start

00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:17,479
reaching out to those bulk purchasers

00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:19,759
right like these you're now identifying

00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:21,439
the fact that only 10% of your customer

00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:23,599
base actually are interested in bulk

00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:25,429
maybe you're not advertising in the
