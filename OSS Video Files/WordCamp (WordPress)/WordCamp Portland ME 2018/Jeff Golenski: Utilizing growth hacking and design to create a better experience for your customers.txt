Title: Jeff Golenski: Utilizing growth hacking and design to create a better experience for your customers
Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	Traditionally, marketing and product design have been thought of as separate roles within many organizations. Often times, a gap is formed between the two, leaving an inconsistent experience from the time a customer is made aware of a product up through the time they’re an actual customer. Whether you’re a freelancer or part of a large company — join me as I dig into the growth funnel (AAARR model—Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral and Revenue) and explore ways in which you can rapidly iterate in your marketing and product to provide a more cohesive experience for your target demographic.

he's excited to learn about growth

00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:12,400
hacking marketing and design today she's

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,199
much more awake than I am that's

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,910
fantastic

00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,789
so who knows who knows through this

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,220
product this never know does anyone use

00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,630
ever now does everyone love Evernote so

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,430
I've been using Evernote for quite a few

00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,620
years probably close to a decade and

00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,770
they're one of my favorite products and

00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:34,059
also they are one of the best examples

00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,289
of growth hacking that I've seen so just

00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:37,960
a little bit of a history about Evernote

00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:40,060
so they started around 2008 and they

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,500
started with a closed beta and they did

00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,540
no marketing for the first few years

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,250
while they're around the products

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,800
founders wanted to focus on building the

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,390
best product that they possibly could

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,100
and so they did a lot of really cool

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,910
techniques that generated a lot of buzz

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,399
so early 2008 they started with about a

00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,350
hundred invites and they wanted to kind

00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,840
of do like some user testing with these

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,430
hundred invites and it kind of spiraled

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,829
out of control to about a hundred and

00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,020
twenty five thousand users in 2008

00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:11,049
uh-huh and then they started working

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,969
with this freemium model so what they

00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,789
did was actually really brilliant so you

00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:17,469
could download and use Evernote for free

00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:18,759
up to two devices so if you're like me

00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,709
you've probably got more than two

00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,009
devices at any given time I'll probably

00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:25,779
have my phone my laptop and a tablet and

00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,149
so I want to make sure that all my work

00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:30,279
is synced across these devices but where

00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:32,289
they got me was that the three device

00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:35,770
mine so I started paying them because I

00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:38,249
had to use the three devices and one of

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,170
the really cool things they've done to

00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:43,450
initialize some growth was that they had

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,909
a lot of key partnerships one being with

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,770
3m and sticky notes so what they did was

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,419
basically with every pack of sticky

00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,180
notes that you bought you get a year

00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:54,870
with premiums your forever now

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,460
protected and so back in 2008 this was

00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,310
kind of unheard of but if anyone is

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,650
familiar with ambassador programs they

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,870
kind of started this way back when and

00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,720
so what they did was actually really

00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,630
brilliant and so they would have these

00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,310
power users and if you've ever been in

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,630
an office environment where there's like

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,970
a bunch of people having a meeting

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,350
around the board table and there's

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,750
always that one person who's on their

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,340
laptop typing away right and so they did

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,530
was they made these stickers for those

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,150
those users to put on their laptop so it

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,010
said I'm not being rude I'm taking notes

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,060
with Evernote and they kind of spread

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,160
like wild hot

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,360
wildfire there which is pretty cool and

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,620
then adjust the real life concern

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,670
because people like why is this person

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,550
on their computer not paying attention

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,650
and so that was a great little marketing

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,810
technique so a little bit about me

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,400
before we move forward at UX design I

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,400
are working on jet pack an automatic

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,590
with a broad focus on an overall

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
customer experience marketing and

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,470
product making sure there's cohesion

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,820
between the two for a better experience

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:58,049
and research and growth user experience

00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,980
and if you want to follow along while I

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:01,290
give this talk

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,190
it's just slides comm slash Jeff

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,220
kolinsky slash growth slash life sorry

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,900
for the long URL but pull it up on your

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,680
phone your laptop right now just follow

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,330
along you can't see the slide step well

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,769
so we've got a lot to cover today and

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,600
just to give you a little feel for we're

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,370
gonna be talking about I'll be talking

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,610
about growth hacking is a methodology

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,959
the history behind it what is it

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,930
traditional marketing versus growth and

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,160
then a bit about the process behind that

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,620
and then I'm gonna dig into how growth

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,540
design transcends marketing and native

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,450
products there's this thing called the

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,880
a3 r30 plan on what each component to

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,220
that and how you can apply that process

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,989
over your work and then finally I'll be

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,550
talking about how to harness and some

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,060
tips to help you mark

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,010
and services design and especially a

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,530
focus on quantitative and qualitative

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:57,240
research so what is all this stuff so

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,950
I'm going to be talking about hacking

00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,300
marketing design and I'm gonna be

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,030
throwing these turns around line and

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,070
just so you know basically growth

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,190
hackers and growth marketers place an

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,440
emphasis on the business itself using

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,600
like these little hacks and marketing

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,360
techniques to drive growth from the

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,220
business growth designers take that like

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,709
a another step deeper and what they do

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,450
is they kind of focus on user centric

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,640
design to make sure we can grow the

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:29,250
business but also offer great customer

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:31,800
experience so let's set the stage so

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,400
this all started around the mid 90s

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,290
during the.com boom you know starts for

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,500
exploding Microsoft Paint Eve's Apple

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,200
was huge and there was a shift in the

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,880
way people use and absorb information

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,710
you don't have became like a household

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,010
thing things started moving a lot

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,200
quicker and then traditional marketing

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,900
wasn't working the way it used to it's

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,210
very expensive it was very wasteful and

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,220
so this new sort of mindset came out how

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,110
can we get in front of customers how can

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,850
we slide things across their desk rather

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,560
than trying to to market with them on a

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:10,200
grand scale and so one of the examples

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,970
that I love to use and talking about

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,850
growth hacking growth marketing growth

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,370
design is actually Airbnb so if you're

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,610
not familiar with Airbnb history they

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,980
actually started as a company that

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,029
focused on getting people to rent out

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,819
their living

00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,079
only as a bed-and-breakfast so someone

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:30,479
would literally sleep on like their

00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,619
couch like a couch surfer or maybe in

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,029
their bedroom and then they would

00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:35,279
actually offer the full bed and

00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:38,009
breakfast experience just in their

00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,739
living room and so what Airbnb found is

00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:42,329
that that's kind of a niche thing and

00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:44,489
not many people worrying about weird

00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:47,459
experience just eating breakfast in

00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:49,499
someone's tirade so they discovered that

00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,829
there was a bigger market to be had

00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:54,239
there and so they expanded to allow

00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:56,309
people to rent out their entire

00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:58,439
apartment or rent out their entire house

00:05:56,309 --> 00:06:00,179
and now there are 10 billion dollar

00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,889
company because they saw a different

00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:03,360
product market fit there and they

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:06,959
pivoted and change their business model

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,610
quite a bit and so another thing they've

00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,339
done which is really awesome which I

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,559
love there's how many people here travel

00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,119
places and they open up Yelp and you go

00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:17,819
and you're looking to find like a new

00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:19,499
place to eat wherever you are and then I

00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,079
do this all the time but I don't just

00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:23,669
grade like possible experience on like

00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,959
the ratings I look at the photos pretty

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:27,929
heavily especially if I'm looking at

00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,699
somewhere eat and so if a customer posts

00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,379
these absolutely terrible photos that

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,749
are like half blurry half-eaten burrito

00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,179
I'm likely to not go to that restaurant

00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:38,009
just because that customer posted that

00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,550
we're looking photo of that half-eaten

00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:41,669
burrito

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,499
so what Airbnb did was actually send

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,599
professional photographers around the

00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:47,279
world to these different people who are

00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,469
trying to rent out their homes and their

00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,479
apartments and they had Co photographers

00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:52,979
take photos of their places to put on

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,059
their website to keep the value of their

00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:58,289
marketing up which is pretty cool and

00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:00,209
growth hacking especially is about

00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:01,469
moving quickly shipping the iterating

00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:04,019
shipping and iterating just getting

00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:05,849
things out the door as a traditional

00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,069
designer I've always been the type of

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:10,169
person who likes to be a perfectionist

00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,029
I'll work on the redesign of my website

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,259
for like six years before I ship it and

00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:15,149
then I've redesigned like eight times

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:17,279
and it was really difficult for me to

00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:19,019
get out of that mindset of just get an

00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,769
MVP out the door just got a minimal

00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:25,559
Viable Product just to get it out there

00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:27,389
and so to dig in a little bit more in

00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:29,459
growth marketing versus traditional

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,199
marketing when we look at traditional

00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,150
marketing over the past decades

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,680
throughout the 20th century

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,530
in the history of traditional marketing

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,300
its it basically places the focus on

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,030
driving awareness and acquisition of a

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,520
product spending a ton of money to get

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,680
people to know a product so if you look

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,090
at like tapering sums like radio

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,910
advertisements and if we're thinking

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,319
about like a an automobile dealership

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,000
and a little span like whatever ten

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,949
thousand dollars for a month-long

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,770
commercial marketing campaign and radio

00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,500
and they send it out there and the radio

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,940
station will play these ads - however

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,160
many people listen on the radio between

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,720
9:00 to 5:00 Monday to Friday and they

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,039
just tried marketing as many people as

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
possible and they just throw a ton of

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,900
money in it but it's not really directed

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,009
at any specific type of person before I

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,410
was listening to the radio

00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,389
our friends at Squarespace wicks and

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,130
Shopify do this they spend like 50

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,690
million dollars a year trying to

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,300
advertise to as many people as they can

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,180
so we think about like Superbowl ads in

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,590
Squarespace that's all they do is go and

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,900
kind of money and have commercials at

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,669
Superbowl but it's for a bunch of people

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,349
watching football and not necessarily a

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,110
bunch of people who need small business

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,000
websites if you're thinking in terms of

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,740
growth hacking what we would do is we

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,719
would target more specific people that

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,329
way people who might be looking for a

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,579
website so the main takeaway here is

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:49,980
that marketing is making people want the

00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:52,890
product whereas growth marketing is

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,750
making a product that people want and so

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,610
seeing how people interact with your

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,750
products seeing how people react to the

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,890
marketing of your product and then

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,160
changing the product based on that and

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,810
there's a little real-life example of a

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,750
little growth package that I discovered

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,579
so on the side of a hobbyist

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,950
photographer and I made a promise to

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:17,010
myself that when I was younger any hobby

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,930
that I have I would make myself kind of

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,270
recoup my costs of the hobby through the

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,940
AVI itself so what I do is try and sell

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,820
my photo prints and I took this photo

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,680
and Canada a couple years ago and what I

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,750
did was I posted it on my Instagram and

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,980
I've got a Facebook page you know if the

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,200
thing that every small business owner

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,270
would do and then you know you got a

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,589
couple likes and a couple people comment

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,560
like wow that's beautiful but no one

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,070
bottle print and so what I did was a

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,710
little

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,520
experiment experiment on Instagram where

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,260
I am so I did it and set the location

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,960
this is in British Columbia Canada and

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,730
then what I did was I clicked on the

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,920
Instagram app and then I looked at all

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,410
the people who had recently been to this

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,180
location and then posted similar photos

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,700
of this and I was like wow this is a

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,290
great place and in a very creepy sort of

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,290
way I followed all those people in

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,950
because they had an emotional connection

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,900
for this place they had then drove

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,490
traffic to my website and I sold 15

00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,190
prints from those people that I went to

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,570
follow so I specifically targeted people

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,950
who had been there and enjoyed their

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,570
time there and had an emotional

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,060
connection and the great thing about

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,130
that was my customer acquisition cost

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,630
was zero because I spent zero dollars I

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,100
didn't do any sponsored content on

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,650
Instagram or sponsored content on

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,540
Facebook so that's kind of like a little

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,070
growth hack right there you can kind of

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,860
specifically target these different

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,160
people and you grow your business that

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,410
way all right so let's dig into the

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,930
process my my favorite I'm a very

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,820
analytical person so as I mentioned

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,470
before growth hacking growth marketing

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,530
growth design is all about shipping and

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,270
iterating and so a great product process

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,310
to start doing that is to start with a

00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,410
little bit of research dig into Google

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,480
Analytics look at some talk to some

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,860
people get a baseline for like how

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,420
people are using your product how

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,760
they're using your service how they're

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,650
using your marketing website and then

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,570
come up with an idea I just think of you

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,540
know like okay I looked at google

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,340
analytics I see that this try it free

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,600
button on the homepage or the signup

00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,540
button on the homepage in this location

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,490
isn't working very well why what's going

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,020
on here let me let me think about a new

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,790
place to put that on the homepage and

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,250
just get it out there just ship it and

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,120
then as you ship it it's gonna start

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,890
measuring you're gonna start collecting

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,300
data on that even ask people this

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:34,470
doesn't make sense to keep this button

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,150
here you know and and then you you can

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,800
look at that data and then you can go

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,809
back and revise and change and show

00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,720
and measure and etc it keeps going on

00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:44,939
and on so who here is familiar with the

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,639
author's Seth Godin or Tim Ferriss

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:48,869
pretty much everyone right so it's a

00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,509
great story about how this process

00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:52,980
worked for them we all know that they

00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:55,259
both have a ton of books you can go into

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,809
any Barnes & Noble and just buy one of

00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,100
18 books that they published every one

00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:01,499
of their books are at least most of

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,329
their books all started as a blog post

00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:05,939
on the website they posted a couple

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,619
ideas a couple paragraphs they got some

00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:09,869
feedback they got some buzz

00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:11,790
they built upon that idea then they

00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:15,420
released ebooks and then they got more

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,549
feedback you know they changed the added

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,040
things and then it eventually just led

00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,660
to book published so both officers

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,670
started with a blog post worked up like

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,619
a button and then eventually publish the

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,759
book because of that so small ideas

00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,959
turned in the big ideas because they

00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,850
kept iterating and shipping and

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,799
iterating and shipping it's a lot

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,449
different now because you don't see the

00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,799
same success of an author who goes and

00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:35,790
hides in the cabin in the woods for a

00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,739
year and just comes back with a

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:42,990
foreigner page novel unless they're

00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:44,610
Stephen King of course so once you start

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,829
working with that process a little bit

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,269
more I like to stack multiple processes

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:49,740
on top of each other to keep it more

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,170
efficient workflow so I'll start with a

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,850
little bit of research on one idea I'll

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,170
build it and I'll ship it and then while

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,299
it's out there collecting down and

00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,949
people are using it I'll start with

00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,449
another one and I'll let that one

00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:01,740
collect and measure data and then I'll

00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:03,569
start with another one and then as you

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,369
get more and more comfortable you can

00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:08,459
kind of maximize your efficiency here

00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:10,049
and work on various processes and if

00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,220
it's just you I would recommend maybe

00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:13,049
just doing three things at once

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,519
otherwise it gets kind of hectic and if

00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:18,540
you have a small team you can just stack

00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,699
on all this stuff so let's talk about

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,769
how growth design marketing hacking

00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:28,319
transcends marketing and product or

00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:30,240
service so this is called the a3 r3

00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:33,179
funnel so there are a couple of

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,860
variations of this in the wild some

00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,779
people call it pirate metrics because

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,179
the acronym is three a's and three r's

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,580
so R which is the terrible terrible

00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,110
stereotype

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,700
so it's either that or the a triage

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,410
three which I prefer and then you might

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,209
see different versions of this where

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,490
we're innocent acquisition are kind of

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:52,110
one item and then referral and revenue

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,170
are kind of reversed it doesn't really

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,820
matter it's all the same process so

00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,440
digging in a little bit into that so

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,899
let's talk about awareness what is it

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,670
it's education it's informing people of

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,880
what you have to offer it's becoming

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,140
known and why it's important because you

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,459
can't have customers that they don't

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,670
know what your product or services

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:14,279
pretty standard stuff one success story

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:19,920
that I really loved is actually hotmail

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:22,740
who remembers hotmail rest in peace so

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,209
before Microsoft bought hotmail they did

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,709
this really brilliant thing in the mid

00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,620
nineties which was unheard of at the

00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:30,570
time but if someone sends an email

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,700
through hotmail which was a free service

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:36,480
they applied a simple plugin their

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,240
footer this email was sent by your

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,160
Creator now which now sounds ridiculous

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,200
because it's been done to death but they

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,270
were the first people that do it and so

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,860
because of that small email plug on

00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,660
their free product they went from one

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,370
user to being bought for I don't know

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,890
how many million dollars by Microsoft

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,180
because their growth exploded people saw

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,770
that and they were using their terrible

00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,290
squirrel mail accounts and they were

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,839
like let's try this new service and they

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,060
loved it and another success story which

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,620
is huge on Instagram as ambassador

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,730
programs which I mentioned before with

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,140
Evernote and so many companies will find

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,570
advocates of their product or service

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,860
and then they'll give them free swagging

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,050
stuff just to kind of promote their

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,579
brand which actually works quite well

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,079
especially in the photography community

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,779
you'll see a lot of professional

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,050
photographers as like Nikon ambassadors

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:26,880
or Fuji film ambassadors and so you see

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,010
these people posting amazing photos

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,020
that's like hashtag shot with Fuji film

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,130
and it causes all the people to buy the

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,089
product cuz they want to have great

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,980
photos too so that's a great example of

00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,290
awareness moving on down the line is

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,089
acquisition so it's this is the point

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,100
where people know your product and then

00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:45,750
they become emotionally invested they

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,410
haven't yet signed up for your product

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,569
but you kind

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,699
groping them in a little bit and if

00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,290
you're not intriguing people with a

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,699
solution to a problem or just intriguing

00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,930
them in any sort of way they're gonna be

00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:57,180
like why would why would I care about

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,220
your product so a lot of people who have

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,399
done this really well of course Facebook

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,110
with the exclusivity factor if anyone

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,449
knows how Facebook started they started

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,670
in the Harvard College campus and then

00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:10,110
you know College Harvard kids were

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,879
talking there Yale friends and Al was

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,980
like what's this Facebook why can't we

00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,779
have this and then Facebook was like

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,430
we'll get your Facebook and then the L

00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,079
got Facebook and then the Princeton kids

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,980
are like why do these kids have it are

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,449
we not good enough

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,790
Facebook rolled out to them and they

00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:25,110
slowly built up their audience and then

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,240
by the time they had all the college

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,550
campuses general public was like we want

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,839
Facebook and then finally Facebook

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,660
rolled out to everyone and then that's

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,269
how they slowly builds staircase kind of

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,129
broke and then the mailbox app which is

00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:40,170
no longer with us again rest in peace

00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:42,259
actually did this really well was that

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,939
they built this exclusivity factor where

00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:46,529
they had like a numbered list on their

00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:52,680
site and it was like sign up for mail

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:54,029
box at your number 459070 brain were

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,949
like I'm gonna get on this list right

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:58,079
now because I don't want to be the

00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:00,240
500,000 person online and have to wait

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,860
for this product so they have this this

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,240
numbered ticker going all the time

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,549
whether it was fake or not no one knows

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,079
but people people signed up quick

00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:10,740
because who cared is just an email

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:12,539
address and then we're now we're gonna

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,520
dig into activation a little bit this is

00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:17,760
the exact moment where someone enters

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,709
the info and click sign up and so this

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,179
is the part where everyone starts to get

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,770
the growth so this is one of the things

00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,030
we've actually done in the jetpack side

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,710
of things to do this who here is

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,890
familiar with the the process of

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:34,530
installing a plug-in and wp-admin I hope

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:37,530
everyone so one of the things we've

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,210
noticed is that when someone is in WPF

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,070
in the plugins section they search for a

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,539
plug-in you have to install it then you

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,740
have to activate it and what happens

00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,659
after you activate the plug-in

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,159
usually nothing you just left there in

00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:49,230
the plugins screen what do you do next

00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:52,289
no one knows unless you're really savvy

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,390
with WordPress so one of the things that

00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:56,490
I designed was that at the moment that

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,990
someone clicks activate will just show a

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,150
full screen dialog putting them into

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,190
like okay you've activated jetpack we

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,960
know you want to use it here's what to

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,059
do next welcome a jetpack connect to

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,370
wordpress.com here's what we offer and

00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,950
so over the past few years we've seen

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,780
our connections skyrocket and the uses

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,030
of jetpack skyrocket because of this one

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,410
small tweak that we experimented with we

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,300
saw that a lot of people would activate

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,860
jetpack and just not do anything because

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,720
they didn't know where to go after that

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,760
so now that we put them into like a

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,220
linear flow it kind of keeps them

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,230
onboard a little bit longer which leads

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:33,460
me to my next topic which is retention

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,750
keeping happy happy customers longer one

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,350
of the things to keep in mind here is

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,940
churn so it really doesn't matter if you

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,890
have a hundred thousand signups on

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,270
Friday if you know fifty thousand of

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,470
those people leave on Saturday morning

00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,880
because that you're just wasting

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,710
everyone's time at that time at that

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,070
point so what you need to do is work on

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,500
having happier customers and some people

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,300
who do this really well obviously again

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,059
this is why they're so successful the

00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,830
big three Facebook Twitter and Instagram

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,450
with the invention of mentions and

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,390
hashtags and it's something not many

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,700
people think about but it keeps the bull

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,050
roped in so right now I'm sure some of

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,150
you have a notification on your phone

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,920
from Facebook someone's having something

00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,990
that's our funny meme and only you know

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,390
come check this out and they mention you

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,740
and then at that moment you pick up your

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,390
phone you see the notification you tap

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,650
it and then you get brought back into

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,690
Facebook you get brought back into

00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,160
Twitter and that's how Facebook and

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,630
Twitter and Instagram keep you coming

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,520
back so they can keep showing you

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,490
advertisements and things like that and

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:35,980
keep you engaged longer they're very

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:38,590
simpie watch out for them and so next

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,420
down the funnel is referral programs so

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,120
I know these have been done the Deaf

00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,650
over the past decade or so but you can

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,890
get really clever with the way that you

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:50,200
do these one company we did this really

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,660
well is Dropbox if anyone remembers when

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,250
Dropbox first came on the scene what

00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,290
they would do is say I sign up for

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,010
Dropbox and if you refer your friend

00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,170
will give you one hundred three

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,900
megabytes of space up to ten gigabytes

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,380
and so I remember I went crazy and

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,940
referred

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,620
everyone I know for free drop on the

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,920
accounts and to this day I still have

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,450
ten gates of free space and Dropbox and

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,130
I know a lot of my friends actually end

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,230
up paying for Dropbox because they

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,880
didn't get as much space as I did so

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,110
they got their customers they grew their

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,450
business I still have a free account

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,640
what we're doing good

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,840
and if everyone remembers Groupon I

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,540
don't know if they're still around much

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,580
but Groupon was great I'd like these

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,170
group events and giving coupons for

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,600
different you know services and local

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,360
businesses and so Groupon was great

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,420
about saying hey you can get this offer

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,950
for free you can get like this go play

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,840
paintball at this paintball course for

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,060
free if you refer five friends and then

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,410
I'd like hey friends check this out sign

00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,960
up for this so I can go play paintball

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:50,490
for free and so that's how Groupon and

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,710
kind of through their customer base and

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:55,360
then finally there's revenue and I don't

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,220
really need to talk about why you want

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,990
to make money but one of my favorite

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,610
quotes that's been set a lot is we don't

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,190
make movies to make money we make money

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,440
to make more movies and I don't know if

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,660
that's Amazon's scheme probably not but

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,280
one of the one of the great success

00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,970
stories about Amazon has anyone heard of

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,980
smiled on amazon.com yeah that's

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,140
fantastic so if you are an Amazon

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,550
shopper Amazon does this really cool

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,100
thing that they don't know yet advertise

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,140
too much but if you shop from smiled on

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,360
amazon.com you can select a charity and

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,190
like 1% of all the money that you spend

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,010
on smile that amazon.com goes to that

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,230
charity so they kind of drive their

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,200
business selling the same products that

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,160
they normally sell but with this

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,170
sub-domain attached to it it's like a

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,370
charity program so 1% of all the money

00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,920
that you spend goes through different

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,840
charity that you select and it kind of

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,250
is a nice way to drive business yet also

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,800
give back and I think that was very

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:52,900
clever of them to do that so next up you

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,970
all remember both of these things so

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,950
what I like to do is keep moving all of

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,390
my different pieces moving forward it's

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,520
not like a game of chess where you're

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,050
more strategic it's more your game of

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,140
checkers or you just kind of move up the

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,290
board so what I do is I'll find I'll be

00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,970
like okay what do I want to do

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,680
drive more awareness on this product

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,240
that we have like I work for jetpack so

00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,770
what am I gonna do to drive more jetpack

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,050
awareness I'll do a little bit of

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,940
research I'll come up with an idea I'll

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,800
ship it I'll let it measure and then

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,530
while it's gaining data people are using

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,390
or looking at the website and we're

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,640
looking at Google Analytics I'll go to

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,900
retention how do i what can I find in

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,220
the product to make it a little bit

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,260
better to keep both customer happier

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,240
longer then I'll do the same thing with

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,670
that I'll come up with an idea we'll

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,840
ship it will be like an a/b test sign it

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,640
out there for a couple weeks or a month

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,040
and while that's just sitting there

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,810
percolating I'll work on something we'll

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,640
do like revenue like how can we make

00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,440
more money with this probably again same

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,630
thing and then you just keep revisiting

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,940
and revisiting one of the the big keys

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,620
here is that you never want to come up

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,970
with ideas ship it launch it and forget

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,230
about it you always want to make sure

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,880
that you're coming back to the idea

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,920
whether it be two weeks whether it be a

00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,720
month whether it be six months you need

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,680
the follow-up otherwise you're not even

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,270
keep up with that constant growth and

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,800
now we're gonna talk about how to help

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:10,160
your marketing and your products and

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,020
some tips and tricks there so research

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,000
I know research gets a bad rep

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,240
especially if you had to write tonnes of

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,280
thesis papers in college or high school

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,200
but it needs to be done whether it's

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,390
quantitative or qualitative try and get

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,920
a mix of both you're gonna need to

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,930
utilize them you're gonna need to know

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,510
how people are using your product or

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,130
service and if you need to change your

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,900
business goals if they're not using the

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,250
way you thought maybe the way that you

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:38,060
design your business isn't the way you

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,020
need to have your business and so we're

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,110
starting with qualitative research

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,390
everyone knows this one it's having

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:48,170
things like Google Analytics and heat

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,880
map setup that's the wrong slide it's

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,730
diving things like heat map setup Google

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:56,150
Analytics jetpack stats I use

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,800
quantitative things like analytics for a

00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,780
lot of investigative work so let me show

00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,040
you some examples of that hot jogger is

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,110
one of my favorite tools for heat

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,540
mapping so what we can do is we can

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,540
anonymously kind of monitor how people

00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,460
are using our website so in jetpack comm

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,200
we have this set up and we can kind of

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,510
look at what devices are wrong if

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,950
using you know if there are large

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,990
screens and laptops that throwing

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,059
tablets have thrown their phones we can

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,710
see how their what they're clicking on

00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,019
we can see where they're scrolling and

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,610
moving around the screen and so it gives

00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,309
us a little bit of insight because if we

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,539
like the warmer marked so where the

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,100
people are clicking the most and if you

00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,919
highlight over those you can see exactly

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,049
how many clicks you've had and the given

00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,389
sample size that you've assigned so most

00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:42,510
of the time I'll say I let's set up heat

00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:44,399
map for jetpack comm we'll set it to for

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,110
the next two thousand unique views we'll

00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,100
see how people use the site what they're

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,929
clicking on where they're going what

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,700
they're doing and if we see that maybe

00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:52,200
we've got this call to action button set

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,029
up in the bottom right on the side

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,039
somewhere and they're not clicking on it

00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:57,570
maybe it's time to think about changing

00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:01,950
out with patient changing the verbiage

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:04,559
that sort of thing and then we can set

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,809
up things like flows and funnels where

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,330
we can see like okay we've got seven

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:11,909
thousand people who visit the homepage

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,260
only a lot less than that only like two

00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:15,120
thousand nine hundred those people end

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,980
up going the pricing page from there

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,899
only one thousand people actually end up

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,940
becoming customers and then there's a

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:22,919
steady decline there all the way down to

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,630
actual registration of our product and

00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,220
it's really nice bill to just really

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,830
quickly look at this and say all right

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,169
so out of the seven thousand people who

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,669
visit the homepage three thousand visit

00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:34,889
the pricing page that's a pretty steep

00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:36,330
drop-off what's happening here why are

00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:39,570
we not in treating people that we're not

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,549
giving them enough information are you

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,139
know as our pricing structure wrong that

00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:44,669
sort of thing so you can quickly just

00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:46,019
dive in and this is the initial part of

00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,059
that process I was talking about the

00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,350
research part so I'll say all right

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,059
maybe the home page needs some work

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,980
let's look at that I've come up with an

00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,389
idea I'm gonna ship it will test that

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,350
will set up when you final in a month to

00:25:54,389 --> 00:26:00,029
see how that's doing and then next up is

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,799
the qualitative research I've gotten

00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:05,039
really into this over the past year at

00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,350
automatic and speaking with people I

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,549
find that if you have one 20 minute

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,350
conversation with someone who's a

00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:12,039
customer it's better than any google

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,229
analytics dashboard you can invest

00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:16,389
because I can learn a lot about how

00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:18,340
people are using my product what are

00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:20,139
they doing what do they love what don't

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,759
they do what don't they love that sort

00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:23,979
of thing but when you're doing these

00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,960
things if you have like like survey

00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:28,419
setup or formal interviews where you

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,249
have video columns with customers it's

00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,659
important to have a prefix sample size

00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:33,220
because there's always that outlier you

00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:36,070
could talk to one person who's very

00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,690
specific niche like if we're talking to

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,340
you while you're part of probably pretty

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,960
technical with WordPress you might not

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,429
be the intended demographic that we're

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,769
looking to get information from we might

00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:47,349
want less technical people maybe we want

00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:49,840
to interview developers specifically or

00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:51,820
pro marketers that sort of thing and so

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,859
it's important to have big sample sizes

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,599
so you can kind of formulate trends and

00:26:53,859 --> 00:27:00,519
the information and kind of synthesize

00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:03,039
all that and so just a couple tips to

00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,470
get started start with the research as I

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,229
mentioned do the quantitative stuff dig

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:10,389
in form some baseline hypotheses and

00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:12,309
then start to build and ship and just

00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:15,429
figure out what works and what doesn't

00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:17,889
so I'm very technical with my my

00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:19,210
processes you can formulate your own but

00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:21,849
just make sure the important thing is

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,470
that follow-up coming back to your ideas

00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,779
seeing how they worked out how they

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:28,029
haven't worked that sort of things one

00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,919
of the things that I love to do is kind

00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:32,289
of creating a flow charts of the

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,090
different flows of our product so kind

00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:35,470
of mapping everything out seeing where

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,149
people are going what they're doing

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,960
where they're spending their time and

00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:42,489
then kind of formulating different

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,679
hypotheses to figure out okay at what

00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:46,059
point can I work on this part at what

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,249
point can I work on this part at what

00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:50,919
point can I work on that part and just

00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:52,859
moving forward slowly there make sure

00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,119
that you're continuously experimenting

00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:56,799
it really doesn't cost much money to

00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,179
whip up an a/b test if you if you have

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,739
like a marketing website there are

00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:02,200
plenty plugins that do that come up with

00:27:59,739 --> 00:28:03,580
an idea see you never know something you

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,840
might have thought of might not have

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,849
thought of six months ago might be

00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,419
awesome and generating traffic and

00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:12,399
generating users now and so a couple

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,840
tactics that have been out there for a

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,289
while that have kind of been overplayed

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,090
um there's this I don't know if anyone

00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,710
has seen this in recent years envision

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,929
app got really good at doing this but

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,610
you'll you'll get like these seemingly

00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:25,290
crush

00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,240
emails from people you don't know and

00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,250
it's like hey Jeff I love what you're

00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,740
doing an automatic great work with a new

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,780
website Jeff Beck comm do you have a

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,890
minute to talk about Marvel app here's

00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,810
an example that happen to be in

00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,640
September by my friend Jin ter who I've

00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,210
never met apparently who knows me very

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,670
well

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,040
uh-huh they wanted me to use Marvel app

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,470
and on September 4th he's 72 emails

00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,910
September 12 sent in to me emails and

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,350
then on September 18th you sent me

00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,050
another one and in one of them you said

00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,250
hey Jeff I know how inboxes can get busy

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,720
I wanted to make sure this didn't get

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,910
lost in the shuffle and I was like you

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,200
serious dude like stop this I'm not

00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,850
gonna respond to this I know this is

00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,530
marketing and in the beginning this

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,450
worked really well and I'm sure it got a

00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,370
lot of leads and was really successful

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,720
but in the tech industry this no longer

00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,520
works because I know this is being

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,180
auto-generated and this my name is being

00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,490
applied to it and that sort of thing and

00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,400
another one which I'm sure you all know

00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,650
very well these pop-ups the minute that

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,880
you load a page or a site if you're on

00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,740
google looking for something and these

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,290
things will pop up like hey subscribe

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,150
now and get six free ebooks or whatever

00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,340
and in the beginning that worked great

00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,800
but now that'll make me easily closed

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,390
your site and so that was a small growth

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,010
tactic that was really successful for a

00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,950
while that's been overplayed to death

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:41,640
and so that's just another example of

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,110
things you might not want to do so

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,610
that's it for me right now

00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,370
if you have any questions I'll be around

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,770
so I can answer right now and my slides

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,430
are at slides comm slash Jeff glinsky

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,430
slash growth

00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:10,350
so over the past few months I've been

00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:13,230
using whimsical cow have you heard of it

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,260
whimsical it's it's a very simple very

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,090
intuitive tool it's very dynamic and

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:34,530
it's their free offering is fantastic

00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:37,170
definitely check it out that's a good

00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:40,100
question so one of the important things

00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:42,570
about as I mentioned before it's kind of

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,130
you need to be contextual and you need

00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,570
to get in front of people at the right

00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,640
time when they're trying to do a very

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,200
specific thing so as I mentioned with a

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,780
jetpack flow it's like we didn't just

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,760
show up like a full pop-up page and said

00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,670
hey get started with jetpack now welcome

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,530
it was only the second after that they

00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,500
activated so the second that they did a

00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,120
very specific thing so one of the things

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,370
I think we do on the jetpack blog is

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,990
that we'll write like an article and at

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,640
the very bottom of the article we won't

00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,560
throw up a pop-up and try to annoy

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,480
anyone but we'll have like learn more

00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,400
about this check out our plans that sort

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,600
of thing right at the very end after

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,980
they've read the content and they're

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,580
engaged they've been acquired you know

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,580
that sort of thing

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,890
there's some things you measure what is

00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:33,350
an example yeah that's a great question

00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,820
um so I didn't mention the talk but one

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,520
thing to be careful of is this term

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,080
called the vanity metrics so I know if

00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,170
anyone's familiar with that term but so

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,700
things like general raw pageviews don't

00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,470
really matter that much like if you get

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,660
like a hundred thousand visit unique

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,010
visits tomorrow and that doesn't matter

00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,210
if you're not converting anyone if

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,810
you've got a hundred thousand unique

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:55,130
pageviews and just five sign ups there's

00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,810
probably something wrong there what's

00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,150
going on and that's that's something to

00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,080
keep in mind because a lot of people get

00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,360
really intrigued with things like

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,860
follower counts and like these numbers

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,780
that really ensure you people like total

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,430
pageviews and stuff like that but the

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,530
things you want to be mindful of are

00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,930
more along lines of actual signups and

00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:14,290
who's converting on things and stuff

00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,290
like that

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,110
Oh

00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:38,030
okay I don't think so I'm I can probably

00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,030
download this and send it

00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:04,299
Oh char you talking about like the

00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:04,299
software itself early game okay yes okay

00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,930
yeah I think that it's especially being

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,340
in the tech industry I think that we

00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:48,340
just have the tendency the Seavey's

00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,930
trend Kurt and more and then like we can

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,210
see them getting an overplayed industry

00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:53,290
a lot like that tactic probably works if

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,390
you're advertising to a lot of

00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,190
non-technical folks but you know me

00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,170
being me I see that I'm like I know what

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,150
they're doing and then seeing my inbox

00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,740
being flooded by 20 of those style

00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,300
emails every week you know it's just one

00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,220
of those tactics that might work at

00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,780
first but the more that it's been done

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,400
the less effective it becomes

00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:12,900
I mean I'm sure it's very successful in

00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,900
some industries for sure yes

00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,250
yeah sure

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,200
well there's the one person in

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,550
particular that I love his name is Ryan

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,200
holiday and he wrote a book called

00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,690
growth hacker marketing which I highly

00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,000
recommend which is I've got a couple

00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,250
resources here this is one of the first

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,740
ones here and it's a quick read maybe a

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,080
hundred pages of stuff maybe less and so

00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,340
he's a really great person that he kind

00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,650
of got me started on this whole growth

00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,510
hacking thing and he's a great person to

00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,130
follow he stays up-to-date with a lot of

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,580
the trends out there and stuff like that

00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,870
so and then there's a few like UX blogs

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,160
that I said it was other than that I

00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:12,850
just see them in the wild right and then

00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:14,450
I investigate yeah are you trying to

00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,890
sell me on something right now

00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,890
[Music]

00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,469
[Music]

00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,230
so I guess it's not maybe the email

00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:43,849
isn't the best channel to reach me

00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,619
specifically so for instance in that

00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,510
example that I sent out that was someone

00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:50,000
working for this Marvel app which is

00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,530
some UX program and if I'm sitting there

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,420
on a Monday morning checking my inbox

00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,740
trying to catch up my emails that's not

00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,710
the best time to try and sell me on a

00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,109
product you know and so maybe as a

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,700
company there grow tactics would be

00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:04,400
better used somewhere else like it as a

00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,619
designer I'm out there like some like

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,700
googling some some new flow mapping tool

00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:09,589
there's something and maybe they could

00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,690
kind of pinpoint their marketing in a

00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:13,460
different place in a very contextual

00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,200
mannalie when I'm actually out there

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,119
looking for something like that as I

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,770
mentioned before like The Waifs quick

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,230
wicks and Squarespace does their

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,549
marketing right they mark it to like

00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,799
millions of people at once in hopes they

00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:26,359
get a few of them right during like the

00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:28,190
Superbowl and maybe that's not the best

00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:29,809
tactic cuz it's very expensive and if

00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,609
maybe that they were marketing more

00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:33,859
specifically like if someone was to go

00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:35,599
to youtube and you know look up like

00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,760
WordPress tutorials which people do all

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,710
the time and you'll see a Squarespace

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,990
out there that's more targeted marketing

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,109
I guess that I hope that answers your

00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,109
question

00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,109
right my expectations were set with the

00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,730
subject line only to be fooled when I

00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:15,730
read the email again we know this person

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,299
right I couldn't on subscribe to it

00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,599
because it's like it's actually sent by

00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:25,599
someone

00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,000
[Music]

00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:49,069
it's not hyper personalized customer

00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:51,680
will be afraid in another case if you're

00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:55,819
very clear about what it is that you're

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,390
doing your plans are still have a very

00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:58,390
