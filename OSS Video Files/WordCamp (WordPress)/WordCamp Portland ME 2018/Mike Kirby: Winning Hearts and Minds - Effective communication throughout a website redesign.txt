Title: Mike Kirby: Winning Hearts and Minds - Effective communication throughout a website redesign
Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	In 2014, The University of Maine determined that umaine.edu needed to be taken to the next level. A year later, a robust new website was launched to coincide with the incoming class and our 150th year celebrations. This session details the journey between these two points, and how we avoided common pitfalls in website redesign projects affecting hundreds of content contributors and their individual websites.

00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,409
[Music]

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,009
[Music]

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:49,180
and the common theme with the ones that

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:52,000
well is so a little bit about University

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:55,989
of Maine's website we are a multi multi

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,300
site we have two multi-site environments

00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:01,300
that are public moment or spitting up a

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,629
third one the primary one that we work

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,259
on is you may not be you there's around

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:11,069
350 public web sites split 425 actual

00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:13,959
web sites some of the variant progress

00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,659
decentralized content men we support a

00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,569
team

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,189
900 or so different users of one sort or

00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,530
another that are in their rules on their

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,840
websites but we centralize the

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,179
application manager so we don't let

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,689
anyway install their own plugins and we

00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:31,950
don't just have the one being that

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:36,299
corporate of extension which is our

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,399
statewide outreach to community that is

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,399
on another Bolton SEC network

00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:45,420
that has about forty to sixty websites

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:50,250
and separate for a variety of needs but

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,829
show us the code base so this our

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,200
digital communications team we're team

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,819
of three bridges and the road here all

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,590
three of us have done here at work today

00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:03,989
and they supported campus of 12,000 with

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,209
focusing on training and communications

00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,579
as actually doing the kinds of work for

00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,670
us

00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:14,430
so the detail was not to go over the

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,500
project itself but to talk about the

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,319
communication so this is just a quick

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,720
timeline of the redesign we started in

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,780
the summer fall of 2014 with

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,750
pre-planning winter sprain was the

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,060
communications piece and then summer to

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,989
fall and 2015 we launched and then

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,739
there's some and of course that was

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:40,470
several years ago

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:42,569
so as an opportunity to migrate to a

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,180
modernized WordPress implementation we

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,700
eliminated legacy plugins and audited

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,830
every website for web accessibility at

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,440
the time it was my

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,170
this process was just the three main

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,810
websites last spring our extension

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,989
websites continue to be migrated that

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,239
projects managed by their communications

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,340
and some of my greatest sites were using

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,830
specialized wordpress themes our goal

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,630
was to get everybody into a single theme

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,380
not even have child themes off of that

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:16,709
and that was achieved at times we added

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,650
options to themes customizer so that we

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,830
were there only available to students so

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,900
we can tweak the site a little bit or

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,049
sites like University and babies in the

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,450
art over the library of site grow but

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,930
individual users can don't have access

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,489
to that high level changing routine

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,670
positive word of mouth about how this

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,610
whipped has gotten a lot of outlying

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,160
sites into our themes so we had the

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,290
climate change Institute the Marine

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Sciences School other sites that were

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,440
large that were outside of work across

00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:08,280
all together they have their own content

00:03:49,440 --> 00:04:10,470
management systems and they didn't so

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,019
pre project communication this is where

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:18,900
you really have to start is taking the

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:21,150
stock it's important to reach out to

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,690
your stakeholders obviously but that's

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,200
hard to do because

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:29,700
you get an earful from them when they

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,700
especially if you have a site that's you

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,460
determine what the pain points are

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,990
that's important that's what you're

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,480
doing a reason for us to address these

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,060
pain points but it's also important to

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,620
look at what's working well because you

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,900
don't want to just throw something out

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,870
that you didn't think people and they

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,150
were using our big example was the

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,800
agency directory that we had on a

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,990
website I thought this is silly

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,640
if the site's well designed and has good

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,880
search who needs to go to an agency

00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,650
directory but know that was consistently

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,240
the top thing people said they liked

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,580
about our website was being able to go

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,790
to a directory and not just rely on

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:10,090
search to tell them where the student

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,700
records department website was at UMaine

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,570
create some of the web advisory group

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,370
we've brought in to the table

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,120
constituents from an administration and

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,710
IT resources education it's challenging

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,330
sometimes because some of these groups

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:26,110
are going to be very busy and they don't

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:28,030
have time to give you time so it's good

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,220
to find proxies for those like the

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,650
faculty we did what have faculty at the

00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,440
table for the redesign and instead we

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,350
found people that had the same mix of

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,650
needs that didn't have time so people

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,750
that were many in professional

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,390
development groups at the University of

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,870
Maine came in and they filled the same

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,540
needs but they

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,480
these meetings this group that we have

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,360
continues to meet six times a year and

00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,980
yeah this isn't one special pink whites

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,500
helped us understand which should be

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,670
addressed it was equally important to

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:10,680
understand this working while settings

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:12,330
still that's the key with this let

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,410
people know what they're going to be

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,760
expected to try to bid on and also let

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,180
them know what you're doing because

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,280
witness a redesign people insert their

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,830
own opinion as to what that means and

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,510
then then you don't meet that then -

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:33,390
then you fail so begin with your end in

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,190
mind stick to the scope you set and make

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,290
sure the project is clearly communicated

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,460
as the project is pitch approved and

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,800
kicked off you don't want to pitch a

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,420
redesign project and people say yeah

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,130
we'll pay for that and then they say

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,170
what do you mean search wasn't included

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,610
or what do you mean the commerce of you

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,630
we don't have any Congress with this so

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,700
make sure that you main we made it very

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,220
clear we are not changing for WordPress

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,890
we were questions working for us we just

00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,910
needed to take it to the next level we

00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,530
made it clear that we weren't going to

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,260
adopt a new search engine we're using

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,360
Google custom search engine that would

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,070
stay the same if we decided later that

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,190
we needed a better search engine

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,770
that is ecommerce we weren't going to

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,930
spit up world become rule commerce into

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:19,110
our theme all of a sudden because you

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:22,740
that would be a little bit too much for

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:25,470
this project we're now working on you

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,060
have a border stop you made the ETU

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,360
multi-site environment that's going to

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,940
be a separate project that will help or

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,050
workshop registration for minor D

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:39,480
commerce for great tactics most

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,160
importantly yeah we determined that you

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,620
shouldn't try to launch every campus

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,740
your work you you made we had a large

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,530
multi-site environment we decided as an

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,200
opportunity to migrate to a better word

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:56,340
press staff all together so we identify

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,050
a set of key sites that would help us

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,680
shake out any shortcomings in our

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,990
solution and we followed it up with a

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,270
post one project to migrate the hundreds

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,510
of sites into the new theme so we had a

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:13,040
set of about twenty or so sites to our

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:16,950
tour news calendar or home page

00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,920
admissions those tech sites we run them

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,690
over all at once and then reached out to

00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,910
the community and started a migration

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,950
project that might not be possible with

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,080
every design this if you're a small shop

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,420
then do the whole thing at once but if

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,900
you're in a large it's daunting to even

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,660
think about what

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,820
to decide let's see if there's an

00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:46,060
opportunity to do that a piece of the

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:47,560
time so during the project this is where

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,940
you loop back in those people that help

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,840
you to discover what you needed to do

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,550
and you make sure that you're thinking

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,470
what they needed you designing the

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,200
audience in mind let's ensure that

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,030
you're addressing their finger points

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,350
for you main you decisions were on the

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,450
designers are made within our broader

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,730
Department of marketing communications

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,190
and we haven't run it up the flagpole

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,800
step to see our vision we were actually

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,820
in a great point there where Siegel Asia

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,310
really wasn't interested in

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,590
micromanaging website so we didn't have

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,230
to just show them here's the three

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,390
different directions were gonna go pick

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,270
one we chose that and then it was later

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,170
that we said this is one we chose and

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:34,300
then that was also the web advisory

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,760
group that we set up we made it clear

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,020
that we weren't going to be expecting

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,180
them to chime in on every little

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,010
decision about the project we just were

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,810
going to give them status updates and

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,210
that status update was an opportunity

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:49,630
for them to say you know I have certain

00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:51,820
that I don't see being met but you get

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,830
into analysis paralysis if you make

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,740
people think that they have to try them

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,020
in a previous job I had a co-worker who

00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,660
share that whenever she's giving

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,880
something

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,090
you like a document she always finds

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,030
something to change just showed that she

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,760
looked at it and if you have somebody

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,440
like that that you're going to just be

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,810
getting somebody that's going to focus

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,550
on this one little thing that they may

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:20,140
not even cared about but they wanted to

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,140
show that they were paying attention and

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,940
so yeah everybody be regularly for

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:33,590
progress reports updates on the emerging

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:36,920
look of the site but the communication

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:43,400
plan for the general internal audience

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,590
outside of our for folks that's you know

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,730
when you're developers are working on

00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:52,400
actually the link the new theme usually

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,590
your communicators are not having to do

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,160
as much but thing is to decide what to

00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,990
do so this is your opportunity to tell

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,330
everybody what the developers are doing

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,900
and share the excitement of the new site

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,760
is coming this is a great time you map

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,350
out the key dates in this plan and

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,480
they're sure you have adequate time to

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,760
prepare and present so the community has

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,480
time to digest and accept the coming

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,790
changes really with our project we

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:26,570
kicked it off in earnest in the February

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:28,280
of 2015 and it was by June 2015 that we

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,190
had all the design choices made pretty

00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,710
much so July is when you

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,560
started that push out to tell people

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:41,750
this is what's coming and by then you

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,760
have screenshots of what it was the key

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,920
dates and then planned an informational

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,780
session something like this where take

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,130
all comers to come and sit and listen to

00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,370
you talk

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,840
that's fee we did that in mid-july we

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,730
send out invitations to the campus

00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,530
community it was a great time during the

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,530
summer students aren't here faculty

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:03,110
actually has some value they argue they

00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:05,510
never have downtime but at least they

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:10,060
weren't having to convene classic suit

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:14,300
or so so that informational session

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:16,190
that's yeah start with why that's people

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,950
are gonna wonder why are you doing this

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:21,890
so tell them this is why they have to be

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,770
designed for us it was very clear we had

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:28,040
to redesign it because mobile we had a

00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:34,180
website that started organically in 2009

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,180
in WordPress and by 2013 it was just

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:44,830
share screenshots

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:48,590
don't try to do a live demo on the site

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:51,950
not just because Murphy's Law if you do

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,320
a demo of a product that's when the

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,330
errors are gonna pop up and they're

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,860
always there even if they weren't so

00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,170
just use screenshots but he no more

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,649
important if you're using

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:05,079
shots folks are going to look at the

00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,959
screen and they'll realize that they

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,570
can't click to go into deeper and

00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,959
they'll just say okay I'll get later

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:16,029
what I if they see you can click and go

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,800
deeper will say I won't see what that is

00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,660
and then all of a sudden your whole talk

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,720
with derail as everybody starts to

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:29,199
wonder why is this page doing this is

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:31,180
step back because we have because yeah

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:34,389
give them a handout to take away that's

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,810
very important it helps Berkshire we're

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:39,310
going to sing and then gives them

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,360
something to take back with us so that

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,480
they're not relying on their own

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,490
interpretation of what you said if you

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,250
just give a talk and somebody takes

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:51,190
notes don't write down something and

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,870
then they'll get back to what they

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,870
talked about and they'll see what they

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,940
wrote as a note and they'll suddenly

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,560
expand on that and when they expand on

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,990
what they wrote notes on they might not

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,870
be accurate at all and what you meant

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:08,050
but in a particular handout they can

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,970
photocopy handout or even better like

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,529
you to point their co-workers to a

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,180
website to get their own copy the

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,329
handout and you have control of that

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,740
message at least there you're saying see

00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:22,390
the hand up that's what we said we were

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,860
doing also you want to make sure that

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,410
you give them kind of a nice structures

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,709
that handout you tell what's changing

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,589
don't let stay in the same so when it's

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:35,040
happening and then in with what they

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,040
need to do

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:46,580
so communication during the project post

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:48,800
communication once you launch well watch

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,950
approaches you want alert your audience

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,690
update your homepage home pages of a

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,610
science effective like in our case this

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,960
we have four sites watching we want to

00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,780
make sure that people that were in

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,890
trading site for those sub sites we're

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,740
aware of something that's going to be

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:06,020
changing soon to communicate that the

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,180
coming change is going to be there for

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,590
your frequent visitors if your whole

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,460
site's flipping it what's then you

00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,980
probably want to look in Google

00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,010
Analytics and identify your entry points

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,460
to the website the most common ones

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:21,590
anything like a campus like this I know

00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,720
some of the people over at camp came in

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:26,030
through the door that was open that the

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,920
vendors and all that and something came

00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,050
through another door and had a wander

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,030
through and find their way over here

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,260
well through websites the same way not

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,910
every place again it comes with a home

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,280
page we're going to come to the page

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,900
that they got to their Google Google

00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Analytics will tell you what this pages

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:47,540
are simple so that home page they're

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,140
still aware of the changes it's a lunch

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,030
day that's

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,590
[Music]

00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,120
looks like even if you're not the

00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:59,310
developer guy because we're going to be

00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:02,070
hearing from you announce the lodge to

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,390
your campus community do not assume

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,770
they're going to open the homepage and

00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,900
notice the update on the road we

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:10,590
actually had somebody like year and a

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,980
half we launched and we're doing this

00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,980
migration

00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:34,200
and you we assume that always involving

00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:36,800
campus news team if you have talked this

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,110
originally for the university but any

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,240
company that has public relations press

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,190
releases or whatever involved those

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,290
folks they're either communicators they

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,660
all have a good handle on you know

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:52,110
getting the word out keep them

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,150
up-to-date as the site's migrating to

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,880
new for us

00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,130
we made announcements on campus news as

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,700
each site was getting watched to kind of

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,319
help show these sites were changing to a

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,990
degree I mean after the first year of

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,670
migrating sites we gotten to all the big

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,300
ones and we stopped doing that because

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,280
it's even too late to say hey my career

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:19,350
marathon website has now changed into

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:22,709
the news an expected expected when we

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:25,920
launched the site went up new site and

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:28,439
immediately crashed because we had

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,990
tested the new staff but we hadn't

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:34,260
tested the new stack totally with the

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,390
live tracker and we set up the old site

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,860
again while we did some fine-tuning of

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:42,240
micro caching and also miss attack and

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,610
we got it back up so that was the other

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,490
thing this make making sure that your

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,900
communicators rather your news team sent

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,540
out the press release the moment you

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,670
sent out the new site that might not be

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,980
the best idea

00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:58,770
wait till you've got it up it's been

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:03,570
looks stable then you can get the word

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:10,020
up but wait up down and then goes up

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:14,640
later in the day later the days so post

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,350
launch support training if your project

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,890
results in the redesigned site in one

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,440
fell swoop

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,090
post launch communications are going to

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,300
be focused on support and grow the

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,679
training support

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,420
publication is pushed off the door on a

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,880
deadline and you work out of the

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:34,270
initiatives it's a communication

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,980
and manage visible ongoing training and

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,080
updates on the success of the website

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,820
will reinforce this perception among

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,780
those for it not just focus on the web

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:48,540
as you are and your immediate team with

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,540
us we started these weekly or wordpress

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,800
so psych migrations that's what for us

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,840
if you did all at once this is not

00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,830
pertaining to you but okay launching new

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,660
sites perhaps and you want to send so if

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,950
you did not flip the entire web sites

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,320
prior this redesign you'll have more

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,060
sites to migrate to cover managing the

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,850
migration process and also being patient

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,030
pieces develop templates for emails will

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:21,180
be sending out as part of the process so

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:24,540
the migration kickoff proposed timeline

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:27,190
status updates check-ins approvals

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,020
develop a training website to showcase

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,070
the new agency to things so that as

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,290
you're training people you have a

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,330
training website that you can throw

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,940
content in and show how these different

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:41,500
features work without affecting live

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,570
content as you review sites that are

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,500
ready for relaunch they'll be helpful to

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,240
have cannons suggestions for Safe Routes

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,590
pretty large big units so that if you

00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,379
find yourself telling you everybody

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:56,059
but all the text on your images avicad

00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:59,269
responds with us we're making sure your

00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,499
say you say the same thing and that can

00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:02,710
respond to get better and better over

00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,710
time

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,440
so the migration process that you made

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,420
was linking the 80/20 rule comes to mind

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,940
80% of the site migrations

00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,510
took 20% of our overall time and vice

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:26,300
versa sites making up a majority of our

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,820
web traffic were migrated to this design

00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:32,450
by the start of all semester

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:36,290
yeah 2017 one year ever

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,790
no 2016 yeah

00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,590
one year after initial launch in

00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:42,170
comparison our last year migrations

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,500
focused on niche sites that may not less

00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:47,300
than 5% of all traffic we finally kind

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,640
of set a white in the sand and said hey

00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,370
we've got to jump off this old WordPress

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:59,179
server and we actually had some sites

00:20:52,370 --> 00:21:03,410
that disappear because or turned out to

00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:05,150
the site was no longer needed because so

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:12,860
some of these sites were migrated into

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:15,110
our new design you main we had a number

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,910
of notable web sites outsider work

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,610
Christina and interesting the graduate

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:22,700
school climate change Institute Center

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,890
on Aging color grade sciences all of

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,270
these were proactively come contacts

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:30,880
with our team to migrate into our

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,880
designs after the sale they contacted us

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:40,539
to ensure you can accommodate

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,070
and I've changed Institute website was

00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:44,309
launched in August of this year as the

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,320
fall semester again so we now have

00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:54,640
really everything that is humane that he

00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:55,090
do is download WordPress so where to go

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,740
next

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,600
if you main we can see the whole week

00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,150
every frustrating that's been a

00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,450
game-changer plus previously we would

00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:07,150
have a series of these like six times a

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,940
year we would do WordPress training but

00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:13,480
by doing it weekly and on the same time

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:16,360
every week it just do I go places now at

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,750
campus and they'll say oh yeah you're

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,270
famous

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,950
we're press training you know the word

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,559
has gotten out that it happens Thursdays

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:29,710
at 10:00 a.m. and we take walk-ins we

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:31,990
like people to tell us it helps the

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:35,770
community see digital communications as

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:39,070
a resource and each team member is it

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:41,350
the opportunity to be seen as a subject

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,179
matter expert in matters pertaining to

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:48,159
the web it gets us physically out there

00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:52,570
that you can see that web even if it's

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,400
web stuff that isn't WordPress we now

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,770
just beginning this year

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,360
send out a monthly email newsletter to

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:02,200
all the administrators of our multi-site

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,909
network we use MailChimp for free and my

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,890
server administrator sends me an updated

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:08,480
list of administrators every month

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,700
which I use to automatically add new

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,049
subscribers we have a big board at the

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,000
great top of the newsletter that says

00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:15,529
you are receiving this because you are

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,590
an administrator at elevated requests

00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:20,870
website no yeah it is an unsubscribe

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,070
button that people can but we ask them

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,600
if you don't want to receive the student

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,850
it's but we don't say if you don't where

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,799
see this new literary lover who say if

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,919
you don't want to be in WordPress

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,870
administrator any longer click here and

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,789
we'll take you out of WordPress and you

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,539
won't get this news liberating we've had

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:40,669
people do that

00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:42,559
it's been great seriously we have nine

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,000
hundred people that are request

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,279
environment we used to have a twelve

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,659
hundred people all sorts of

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,659
administrators when we first started

00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:52,490
this process I got bounced backs from

00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:53,840
people who were no longer on campus said

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,909
nobody had told us so they were still

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,659
administrating the system they could

00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:01,580
have gone and logged in using their

00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:04,190
credentials and done who knows what to

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:09,549
that website it's just you just had a

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,549
security talk you just get lucky

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,019
but now we announce we get

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,459
[Music]

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:43,760
and so that's the spiel how easy or

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:47,180
difficult was that to migrate the dog

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,880
WordPress sites into the UMaine

00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,770
WordPress community was there to pick up

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:59,060
kicking and screaming or was it very

00:24:51,770 --> 00:25:02,420
easy or somewhere between salute came to

00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,430
grudgingly but characterized as taking

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:10,130
the screaming in all cases they came to

00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:13,340
us notably because they had all with one

00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:15,440
exception they had all been in another

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,960
content management system by a company

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:24,380
name that was great

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:26,480
when it came to thousands right and that

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,970
company said hey this is great

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,820
we're not we are in CMS anymore so

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,310
finally in twenty sixteen or seventeen

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,690
they were told this is not going to be

00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,920
any more updates to the suspended

00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,970
management system you really shouldn't

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,290
give it to something else and that's

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,150
when they got in touch with us to say

00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:44,360
yeah we got to move anyways let's move

00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:46,940
to WordPress we were able are focused

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,060
for those sites was to get their Muse in

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,820
WordPress automatically so private

00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,880
change Institute is an example where

00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:59,060
there are hundreds of news posts over

00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,470
the years and we kind of we made some

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,500
changes to their content management

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:06,110
system RSS feed so

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,780
everything from the event beginning of

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,390
time and then we used that RSS feed to

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,760
create posts in WordPress and network

00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,890
upgrade we were able to save them a

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,310
toughy a lot of time on stuff that was

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:21,710
very low value for them to manually

00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,660
migrate pages we have the manually

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,520
recreate because missed opportunity for

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:30,110
them to make sure they were moving

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,600
things that actually they needed and as

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:35,060
part of our kind of our cash feel for

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,090
site migrations in general was just

00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:40,940
before you move out at your site and

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:43,490
pull down it's not you don't want to

00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,770
pack up something in a box to take it to

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:49,150
a new house and then wonder why you

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:51,890
acted when we moved to Maine in 2000

00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:59,810
kitchen stuff and there was a juice of

00:26:51,890 --> 00:27:05,590
unit orange juice squeezer orgy's works

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:08,060
great in Florida not so great thank you

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:12,830
when you guys did the migration and

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:15,650
watch this thing did you see a big dip

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:22,430
in traffic or analytics and say after

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:25,790
launch it's tough to answer that we kind

00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:29,600
of did but we're not sure how much of it

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:33,410
was actual traffic changes due to the

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,820
site living and/or cover measuring

00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:41,540
family and our old you main theme had a

00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,400
Google ad likes hard coded into every

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,900
site was

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,800
and there was an opportunity for your

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:52,100
own codec so there was and so we had

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,470
subdomain sites like English UMaine W to

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,630
you who have necessarily have their own

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,930
analytics code but actually getting our

00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:02,030
catch-all Google Analytics code so at

00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,010
about us page for English you English

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,960
that you mainland edu slash about and

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:09,500
you may need to you slashed about we're

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,080
getting counted as the same age so there

00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,270
was some traffic changes but I was just

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,710
telling everyone that it's becoming more

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:21,740
accurate I would say just in general we

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,690
did see a bounce rate going down with

00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,310
the new site we saw a much better

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,110
experience of a bunch of better

00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:31,130
experience with mobile you measure the

00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:33,650
mobile users and our new site now we get

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,090
a majority of traffic for mobile and

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,980
that just put their been possible with

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,870
the old V because people would have come

00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:42,640
to us from mobile but not stuck around

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:42,640
because it's a terrible experience

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:54,370
the athletic is first in any say over

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,170
team all thirds at all that was really

00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:59,280
that was in our wheelhouse

00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:03,580
so we have our vendor focus on coding

00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:06,040
and we picked a vendor that specifically

00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:09,670
WordPress centric because we didn't want

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:14,020
to hire a vendor that would want to take

00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:16,930
a step back to read well should you be

00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:19,810
using this type management system

00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:21,250
instead and that was really the key is

00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,220
they would all to do their part they

00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:26,440
work like in unison but as much in that

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,910
June timeframe which really gave us

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,730
breathing room to really flesh out that

00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:33,820
communication plan I will say the vendor

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:36,370
did do a great job of trade the trainers

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,770
and we used that training session that

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,500
they gave us in the new theme as the

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:51,670
basis for our WordPress 101 training as

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:54,670
to what water to do things in find the

00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:57,070
hardest thing is to get people to clean

00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,020
up their old site and all the content

00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,390
how did you manage that and how did you

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:05,010
get people to do that on a timely manner

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,160
and the other question I had was about

00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,070
redirections

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,990
did you do a lot of that or you know

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,610
like if they were getting rid of a page

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:18,930
did you make sure that they're being

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:21,730
redirected or not we had a batch process

00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:24,460
that we would have people on a timeline

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,920
of a week one you're going to prepare

00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:30,760
your site by legal content week two you

00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,900
attend our training we free we migrated

00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,120
your snapshot and giving you access to

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,270
the new site and then we give you two

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,590
weeks and we want to launch you that was

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:42,050
wildly optimistic for the majority of

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,480
sites some small sites they were ready

00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:48,200
sooner and they watch them but other

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,150
sites took maybe a year to my pick which

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,430
just opened up a whole can of worms

00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,500
because they had been making changes to

00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,600
their live site that that made to be

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,800
reflected in the in progress site they

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,290
actually have one site that had to do a

00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,960
snapshot a couple of times to be fresh

00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,760
before they did make enough time to

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,429
launch we really wanted to make sure

00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:11,300
that our our point to them was we wanted

00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:13,460
it to be at at worst a step sideways for

00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,990
them in other words we didn't want them

00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,460
to be feeling like they were taking a

00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,470
step backwards and how their site was

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,750
functioning when they launched instead

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,510
quite at the same time we did we told

00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,860
them don't try to make this like it's

00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,270
gonna be amazing that we're in the new

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,610
design because look how much better our

00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,080
site is get your site in the new design

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,840
and then work on the amazing part

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,320
because you that time created we have

00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:40,460
two sites is really a headache so as far

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,650
as redirection in Swedish so like a

00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,330
little bit but we didn't go crazy but we

00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,160
would tell people for large sites in

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,679
particular was we looked at Google

00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,050
Analytics for entrance pages and the

00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,760
entrance pages we made sure that there's

00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,710
your else would stay the same because

00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,530
they're migrating from WordPress to

00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,420
WordPress and we tell them don't change

00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:02,179
the name to your site pages arbitrarily

00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,470
if they're good into its page so we

00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,480
would make redirects for introduced

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:09,020
pages that we're changing but a lot of

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,300
those we just let the search engine we

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,610
would submit site maps to

00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,700
they so that they knew were all be paid

00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:21,800
for but we didn't take an exhaustive

00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:23,900
breakfast did you have to chase people

00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,550
down for new content that people look at

00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,200
this as an opportunity to freshen their

00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,150
content because sometimes that's really

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,030
such a bugaboos trying to get the

00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:37,880
content from the client yeah so because

00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:40,720
we're migrating all your content but we

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:51,820
did tell people we give them some tools

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:54,830
WordPress back to the day when we expose

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,960
into the page dashboard and tell people

00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,300
sort your pages by last modified date

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,970
and that's where you start is the pages

00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,140
that have been modified since 2010 not

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,300
that they were pretty enough pieces

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,850
created in 2010 is fine if you're

00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,190
keeping it up to date but touch that

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:20,660
patient now's the time to take a look at

00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:23,090
it and decide oh my gosh talks about so

00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:33,410
not rather but instead of being

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:35,870
president 3d Mundi and then we did

00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:39,610
really try to get them to do a good job

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,610
with their home pages in there

00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,260
