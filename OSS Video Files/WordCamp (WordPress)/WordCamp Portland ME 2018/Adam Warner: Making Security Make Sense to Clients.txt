Title: Adam Warner: Making Security Make Sense to Clients
Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	As someone who builds WordPress websites for clients, you’ve probably learned that offering (or requiring) monthly maintenance contracts is smart business. It’s likely you’re including core software, plugin and theme updates as part of your maintenance plan, which ensures a steady income stream you can rely on and helps with your financial forecasting. But are you including website security as part of your project proposal and scope?
The security of your clients’ websites is often not a priority or is left till the end of a project (or sale?) as an optional add-on for the client to consider after going live. The value of a strong website security posture can be difficult to explain to clients, but when put in the context of their business and possible loss of revenue, it can become an integral part of your offering that separates you from the rest.
In this session, Adam will cover simple website security best practices that you can implement immediately for your own site and those of your clients. In addition, he’ll also offer advice and examples on how to best present the importance of website security during the proposal, scope, and maintenance package stages to your clients. Not only does this ensure your maintenance plans offer what every website needs, but also presents an additional revenue stream opportunity for your business.

this session is called making security

00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:13,260
makes sense to users and clients so

00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,850
first I have a question for everybody

00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,270
how many of you are actively building

00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:25,450
sites for plants good how many of you

00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:28,090
have your clients on monthly care ok so

00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,700
the intention of this talk is to provide

00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,100
useful tips for helping to earlier

00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,980
business in your monthly revenue by

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,930
including security in your client

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,530
projects and in your maintenance advance

00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,810
and more specifically how to make users

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,350
and clients understand the importance of

00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:50,050
security and why it matters so my name

00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,899
is Adam Warner the open source community

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:56,350
manager for site lock and I'm all these

00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:58,410
other female 42 is come see me we'll

00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,910
have a chat

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,190
so number you remember today is securing

00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,719
your own sites secure your client sites

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,479
the benefits for your business and those

00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,799
of your clients communicating security

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,200
benefits

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,959
efficiently including security in the

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,490
project scope and kind of the core of

00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,079
this with the clients is the

00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,810
communication and the security best

00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:23,380
practices maintenance programs pricing

00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,090
and recording options so first I want to

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,950
talk about the benefits of securing your

00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,950
on the site right it's kind of a

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:35,600
that's important but if you're providing

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:38,270
the sites for clients it becomes

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,760
especially important because your

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,990
reputation can be affected if your site

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,480
isn't secure you're not taking steps so

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:50,120
website packs happen all the time every

00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,510
day I'll talk more about the why and how

00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,260
that a little bit but if your site gets

00:01:53,510 --> 00:02:01,369
hacked and I'm googling Portland Maine

00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,229
web development and I see your brand and

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,410
I go to your site chrome tells me that

00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:10,640
the site may not be safe or icy winds do

00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:12,290
viagra or other pharmacy shops I'm

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,510
immediately going to associate your

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,100
grant with a negative connotation or

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,080
don't leave and I'm going to tell my

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,380
friends about it probably other business

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,730
owners other people who need site so

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,560
it's really important to protect your

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,590
own site first because of that

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,360
reputation but also so you become

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,480
familiar with security and best

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,800
practices I like to say now

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,590
tongue-in-cheek that I've never

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,590
recommend something to my clients that I

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,310
haven't use myself but really what I

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,860
mean is I will never do that right so if

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,120
you're using any kind of security

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,500
plug-in or product or cloud-based

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,930
security you are going to be familiar

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,380
with what it is you're recommending to

00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:00,350
your clients the pros and cons of all of

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,140
that so I really strongly suggest eating

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,150
our own dog food to become familiar as

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,430
familiar as you can so when you start

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,500
this conversation about security with

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,580
your clients it's obvious that people

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,580
know that

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,569
and also it's about protecting your

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,319
business mm-hmm if your site is hacked

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,480
especially if you're selling than any

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,550
kind of product or inventing that any

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,540
kind of revenue from your site on a

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,940
daily basis

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,890
if you suffered a hack and let's say get

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:37,209
cleaned up in 24 hours you still lost

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:39,340
the day of hey this is especially near

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,310
and dear to my heart because I had a

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:47,140
business that was ruined by a security

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:50,019
hack back in 2006 2007 I started a

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,030
company called indie lab and I used

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,790
WordPress the multi-site does anybody

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,989
not know what multi-site is and quickly

00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,760
explained everybody knows a multi-site

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,489
is so people can come and sign up for

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,549
free sites so it was geared toward

00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:07,660
artists of all kinds to give them free

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:10,209
blogs and websites and then I started to

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,370
upsell them different features if you

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,660
could turn on with a network activated

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,980
plug-in that sort of thing

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,350
and I started to make a pretty good

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,049
revenue I was working full-time at the

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,720
time I was about two weeks away from

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,940
putting in my two-week notice because I

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,360
was earning enough monthly that I

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,360
thought

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,530
don't look at me and my chest was out

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,680
and then one morning I woke up to a

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,020
bunch of emails hundreds of emails from

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,180
hundreds of different users of my

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:47,120
platform asking why I had put my eggs as

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:51,290
their content obviously I hadn't done

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,510
that so I jumped on to the forums at the

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,210
time the multi-site plans because it was

00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,710
before it was in included and the

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,630
wordpress course download and I started

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,730
to get help from a couple of people

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,100
maybe Andrea and Ron Rennick out of

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,840
Canada they were giving me tips on what

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,510
to do how to clean up the hack because I

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,160
couldn't go to some service and just say

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,310
can you clean this up because it didn't

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,500
exist so that went on for a few days I

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,540
fix things everything was hunky-dory

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,550
replied to all the emails sorry for the

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,610
trouble there's a free month of services

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,350
and then it happened again and then it

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,560
happened again because there were

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,030
backdoors on the server that that I

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,010
couldn't find that no one else was

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,140
finding and I didn't know enough about

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,660
website security it was my first ever

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,970
experience with website security in

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,410
hacks I just didn't do anything so I

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,030
ended up just shutting down the business

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,340
because again I was working full-time

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,670
and family to take care of and the

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,930
stress was overwhelming refunded

00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,690
everybody's money and then I got

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,510
depressed clinically depressed but

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,270
pretty down in the dose that I had

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:02,120
failed right so it's about protecting

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,690
your business becoming familiar with

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,270
security so the benefits of securing

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:12,560
your client sites I know they're pretty

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,129
obvious one right so how many of you are

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,009
actively in

00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:23,279
19 basic security when you build a

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:23,789
client set plugins or otherwise that's

00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,669
good

00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:30,269
so securing your client sites is in your

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:32,909
best interest right any as anyone here

00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:36,209
ever received a frantic email or phone

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:38,849
call Saturday night at 11 o'clock I'm

00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:40,529
sure we all have right it's in your best

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:43,979
interest to not get those kind of

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:46,439
contacts from your clients in order to

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:49,469
find that work-life balance that we

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:53,399
probably as internet people all struggle

00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:56,789
bit at some point right now imagine that

00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:59,610
email says my site is hacked my site is

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:02,909
redirecting to you know adult sites it's

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,429
our responsibility as the website

00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:07,889
provider as the technical provider to

00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:10,379
fix whatever problem that they're

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:14,399
experiencing right so if we do that

00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:17,459
proactively as much as we can before we

00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,379
hand over a site it'll be better for

00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:23,189
everybody and it'll give you peace of

00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:26,309
mind that your clients peace of mind so

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:28,409
let's get into how you do that how do

00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:30,449
you secure a client site how do you make

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:33,269
them understand its intention and how do

00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:36,649
you use that to increase your monthly

00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:40,079
revenue it's all about education

00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:43,849
educating the clients on security what

00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:47,849
it is what the threats are without being

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:51,509
what's the word without being a fear

00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:53,759
monger mm-hmm it's about education but

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,979
more importantly it's also about

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,709
spreading awareness making the internet

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:02,069
a safer place for everybody right how

00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,439
often do we on the news hear a story of

00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:08,839
some major heck

00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:14,309
Equifax millions and millions of people

00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:15,270
so in my mind security is not just the

00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,970
right thing to

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,270
do it's also the right thing to do for

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,660
the internet as a whole so just like

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:27,870
walking through a city alone at night

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,210
having the weirdness every day internet

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,380
security and our weather our personal

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:37,650
information the super important so who

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,890
is responsible for security you the

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:43,830
client or the web host anybody

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:47,040
all three exactly two to varying degrees

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:52,110
right so this is the analogy we like to

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,790
use at work which helps people kind of

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,610
put all that stuff in perspective

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,250
because if you go on to any Facebook

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,410
group or anywhere online and say what's

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,780
the best web host you're gonna get an

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,760
answer for every single web post that

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,770
exists out there and in those answers

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,560
you're going to hear people say this

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,690
host is insecure this post purposely

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,690
hacked my site so they could sell me on

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,060
you know security from from whatever

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,030
they do it but they the short answer is

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:25,080
that it is all three people so you can

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:27,780
think of a web host as an apartment

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,960
complex right so they own the property

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,420
they own all of the individual buildings

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,760
within that complex so a host is

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,490
primarily responsible for the security

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,410
of their network of all those servers in

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,990
their complex it's in their best

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:46,830
interest to keep that comment and write

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,720
the application level WordPress or any

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,400
other platform that you install on one

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,710
of those

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,160
is the responsibility of you as a

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:59,089
website provider but ultimately your

00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,460
client the website owner so the host

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,650
makes sure that the lights are parking

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,520
lot lights are on the snow is shoveled

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,080
the sidewalks are clear and then as a

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,810
developer we are the ones building the

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,420
buildings we have to make sure in terms

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,660
of sending the site up for security

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,540
success we have to make sure that we

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,910
that we are doing all the lighting right

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,020
that we're putting the plaster in the

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,210
way that is supposed to

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,160
we're following codes and then the

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,170
website owner is the one that when they

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,720
leave that individual apartment in that

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,970
building in that complex that they have

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,680
to lock their door they have to even

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,960
close their windows so just like a

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,480
brick-and-mortar store an owner wouldn't

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:49,430
be done for the day and just walk away

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:52,460
you have to secure your website as just

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,310
like it's your home so setting your

00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,860
business apart mm-hmm educating your

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,510
clients and security can be back though

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,430
so that analogy is something that you

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:04,580
can start to use in your conversation

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:09,170
with your clients right and so when do

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:12,490
you start talking about security with

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,800
your clients from the very first email

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,980
the very first phone call and mentioned

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,470
that that is part of your core value in

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,040
orders misses to create sites that are

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:29,030
not only designed to grow their business

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,670
but also to secure that business

00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,890
away so you can start to set yourself

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,440
apart by talking about that so if I'm

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:40,190
going to three different agencies and

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,200
asking you know for quotes on things the

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,060
one that talks about security the one

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,310
that talks to me about being a partner

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,990
in the growth of my business to me

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,820
personally is the one that's going to

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:55,460
get more of my attention rather than

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:57,830
just giving you a quote on a bill so you

00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,720
can expand that that initial

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,720
conversation into educating them about

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:07,370
website security as it pertains to their

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,730
business and I'll show you how to do

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:13,370
that the last benefit of educating your

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,530
clients presents additional revenue

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,390
opportunities right so you can demand

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,790
higher prices if you're setting yourself

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,790
apart by talking about security

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,500
well agency B wants to charge me ten

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,900
grand but you want to charge me eighteen

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,600
thousand or twenty five thousand why

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,090
you're providing the same line items but

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,850
my my time line I don't have security in

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:37,220
it and because we are experts at

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,140
security that's one of our focuses so

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,940
you can demand higher prices when you

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,040
start to set yourself apart and of

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,510
course the residual income comes in the

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,860
form of the maintenance plan would you

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:50,900
include security as a line item there so

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,480
the benefits of communicating the need

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,640
for security effectively this is kind of

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,530
the core information I want to share

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:02,720
with you today many if not most clients

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,250
have an adverse reaction when we

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,590
mentioned security we were talking about

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,530
this earlier so when you talk to someone

00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,260
a new client

00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,880
or that you want to that include

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,430
security they're gonna have one of two

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,060
reactions they're gonna say wait a

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,830
minute my catalog is not important why

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,590
would anybody want to act it I don't

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,800
need security or they're going to say

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:28,530
security is way too technical eyes are

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,260
glazing over to know about it I'll just

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:34,890
deal with it when it happens so how do

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,230
you communicate to those people that

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:40,410
security is important for everybody

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,790
one of the ways to do that is to

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:47,430
communicate three things so you can

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,440
break down website security into some

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,210
basic questions and it's much easier for

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,360
people who are not technical to

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:57,300
understand what it is why it's important

00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:01,320
first you explain the why why websites

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:04,500
get at most websites are not targeted

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,620
for happy there's a few exceptions we

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,210
had a presidential election in 2016 and

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,830
one of the candidates sites was

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:15,510
definitely targeted for hacking it was a

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,130
matter of putting in a special string of

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:20,910
characters in the URL and you could

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,980
change the slogan on the main page

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,720
there are a lot of examples of that if

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,180
you just some googling one of the most

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,130
tame was I like turtles there were some

00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:34,890
that were last year than that so that is

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:37,740
a targeted attack but most tasks are

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,200
automated tell your client that most

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,390
hacks are automated because it's true

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:47,050
therefore automated scripts and box and

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:51,010
it's not a matter of some really

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:53,290
a smart man or woman that is sitting

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:56,620
down writing new scripts every day it's

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,630
a few people who do that but then what

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,390
are known as scriptcase or people who

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,160
want to be hackers go and download these

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,690
scripts then they change a few things

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,560
and then they really some out in a while

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:12,370
so why do I made it scripts capital

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,360
website hacks happen okay sometimes it's

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:18,339
a religious or political ideology but by

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,589
and large the majority attacks happen

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:24,910
because there are some kind of financial

00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:26,769
game so as an example this is something

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,040
you can share my websites attacked and

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:32,680
why your cat blog is still susceptible

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,500
one because every internet and every web

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,220
site on the Internet is a target for an

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,519
automated by the financial part comes in

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:47,040
when I sign up for some service which

00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:50,019
pays me half a penny or a penny per clip

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,880
not her conversion but per click and

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:55,930
then I write a script that has my

00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:00,130
affiliate ID and I search and find a way

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:03,670
in excuse me and I did one I compromised

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,860
one website and then that allows me to

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,079
compromise five websites a hundred a

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,820
thousand a hundred thousand now imagine

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,100
how much money I'm making from the Salah

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,050
debates

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,080
conditions then tell us um when it gets

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,700
wise and shuts me down that's why it's

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,280
about money and it's also about

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,200
information personal information that

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,170
that is something that we all right

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,970
people want our identities people want

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,520
our Social Security numbers in order to

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:33,060
commit fraud but by and large that's all

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,340
financial so who is hacking and how are

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,000
they have I just covered kind of some of

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,610
that it's not the stereotypical banks

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,980
eighteen and a hoodie and there's

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,720
parents basement you know as as people

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,330
who want to take shortcuts who want to

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,120
make money of an easy way or they want

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,220
some kind of 15 minutes of fame to be

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,270
able to tell them tell other people and

00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:00,060
their friends that they're a hacker

00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:04,310
right so website compromises happen in a

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:06,990
bunch of different ways to put it simply

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,030
hacks automated scripts even if it's

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,370
someone manually targeting you they're

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:15,120
looking for an emotive door and an open

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:18,150
door can come in the form of weak

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,570
passwords it can come in the form of

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:25,260
dated software there's all kinds of ways

00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:28,260
that people can get in so I mentioned

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,010
this before when day hacks happen this

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:35,780
is just a quick with security company

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:39,780
called Moore's and this is a real-time

00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,930
picture of paps now some of these are

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:46,170
state players but many of these are

00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:48,360
automated box so

00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,430
when you're educating your clients about

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,800
life Paks happened you made the analogy

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,690
of why it's your responsibility as a web

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,750
hosting and how you were there to

00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:00,360
partner with them and help them then you

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,080
can get into this these five simple

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,790
websites security best practices it is

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,060
pretty simple when you once you break it

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,380
down how to secure a site now I want to

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,880
back up just a little bit I should have

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,900
started this little session with there

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,150
is no such thing as 100% security not in

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,850
life not when you're walking and not on

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,440
websites there just isn't but what

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,780
you're doing is you're looking at this

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,880
big attack radius and you're trying to

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,560
reduce them we're trying to reduce the

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:35,940
chances that something bad will happen

00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:37,740
so number one are backups we probably

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,720
all know this if we've been building

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,790
sites for a while backups are super

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,320
important you want to backup your

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,880
database and your files at least weekly

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,370
probably daily if you have a larger site

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,320
and what's important with backups is

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,030
that you don't store the backup on the

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,010
same server that your website lives on

00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,170
because if your site gets hacked some of

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,650
your backups so you want to store that

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:06,630
off-site Amazon s3 Dropbox we will drive

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:10,169
something like that and you also

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,669
if you are managing a I would say not

00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:13,890
for a cat well but for an e-commerce

00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,929
site that's making a good amount of

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,539
revenue you'll probably want to test

00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:21,179
those backups as well on some secure

00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:24,030
environments and staging environment to

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:28,110
make sure that if something bad happens

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:30,600
that you're not reinstalling a database

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:33,360
or or the files that have already been

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,140
right so if something bad happens test

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,409
those backups keep them for a while

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,789
number two updates this is also probably

00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:44,520
something that you're all very familiar

00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:47,130
with updating WordPress core is super

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,380
important updating your plugins is super

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,690
important and updating your themes is

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,470
super important but I also want to talk

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:58,320
about shiny object syndrome for a second

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:01,500
because I have it when I go into the

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,900
control panel of any number of my sites

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,850
I like to look through all the software

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,799
applications that are there I especially

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,380
like to look at new stuff that like

00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,270
Fantastico with other services put in

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,950
there and I install it on my server to

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,400
play with it and then what happens I

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,380
forget about it

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,929
and it's still software that's sitting

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,929
on my server that probably

00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,750
a software update mechanism separate

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,540
press has so it's sitting there on my

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,310
server it's code it's exposed it

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,620
probably won't get updated so if there's

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:40,090
anything that your that's on your server

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:44,420
that is not directly related to the site

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,930
your yours or your clients get rid of it

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,640
and that includes unused plugins as well

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:52,760
if you do you activate a plugin that

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,060
code was still in a directory on your

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,860
server and it may not be updated so

00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,950
updating all the software that we use is

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:04,520
important and we've all heard of the the

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:07,700
Equifax half rate that I mentioned that

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,490
was due to outdated server software in

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:14,180
part that they knew about four months

00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:17,210
prior to the hack happening it wasn't

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,520
updated it could have been patched go to

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,600
save 143 million people's information

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,250
from getting attacked or potentially

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,010
number three strong passwords and unique

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:31,100
passwords if you have your laptop open

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:35,300
right i really suggest going to have i

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,850
been home or on comm or such passwords

00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:41,570
this is a site by a guy named tony hunt

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:46,910
he is the security analyst from

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:49,280
microsoft and what you'll do when you go

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,680
there is you put in a password that you

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,200
use regularly and then it'll tell you

00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,270
that this password has been seen two

00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,360
times before in a previous data breach

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:04,679
that's pretty cool that's not cool

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:07,049
I used to reuse but it is cool because

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,100
now I don't use that password anymore

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:14,640
anywhere and this service there are

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:19,290
actually plugins in the repo now if you

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,450
search phone passwords I believe in the

00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:25,230
repo someone there's probably two or

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,000
three of them now when you're signing up

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,860
new users for your WordPress site it'll

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,710
check against this guys database so

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:36,120
strong and unique passwords and then you

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,710
tell your clients that you tell your

00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,929
non-technical client that you need a

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,440
strong and unique password for every

00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:45,330
single login for their home Wi-Fi for

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,360
their men local machine for their

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,820
WordPress sites or any login that they

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:55,200
have Facebook Twitter whatever it is and

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,700
they're going to look at it it's how you

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,070
would how do we keep track of strong

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,710
passwords and unique passwords for every

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,760
site and if you're into passwords or if

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,250
you've done on the internet for any

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,799
length of time you're probably aware of

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:10,049
password managers so there are several

00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:13,140
really great password managers that are

00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:16,020
specifically designed to create strong

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:20,100
passwords and allow you to to save and

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:24,090
organize all of those logins LastPass is

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:28,500
a really good one one password is good

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:32,760
- link is good and the key pass is also

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:36,030
good I think I think e-pass is open

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,950
source as well so now if you're thinking

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,690
ahead now you're gonna know well what

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:44,610
happens if that password service gets

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,810
hacked reducing the radius as for

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:49,410
services both

00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:51,750
unless guests have been had before but

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,240
I'd rather put my information in the

00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:57,690
hands who's someone who's poor business

00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,230
is security is tax alert management to

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:03,510
customer I feel better knowing that if

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,250
something happens that they're going to

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:09,570
move as quick as they can to mitigate

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:13,760
the risk but again under percent

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:17,790
security it's not possible

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,800
firewalls and spins if you aren't

00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,850
familiar with what a firewall is there's

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,290
two types of firewalls there is a

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:28,320
network firewall and a web application

00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:31,080
firewall and a network firewall is

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,940
designed and primarily used by hosts to

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,270
protect the traffic that lives between

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,640
the servers in their network the Web

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:41,850
Application Firewall is what I always

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,010
suggest that you include as part of your

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:47,180
client bill and a web application

00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:50,220
firewall is really designed to protect

00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,760
the application of WordPress as the

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:56,070
application so what happens is when

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,500
sadly over here loads her browser and

00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:01,260
requests this domain over here on this

00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,450
web server that request goes through a

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,150
Web Application Firewall first it's a

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:09,420
hardware software solution because it's

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,670
designed to identify malicious

00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,100
traffic before it gets to the web server

00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:16,560
so if you think about automated manner

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,240
and malicious scripts they get stopped

00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,890
before they even get to the web server

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:26,520
to do to do any damage or to look for

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,840
vulnerabilities on your website so super

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,300
important I think Web Application

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,890
Firewall is probably I should probably

00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:36,240
move that up to number one or two

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:39,840
because when I first started using the

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,380
laughs as it's known w8 before that I

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,260
thought it was a bit more popular than I

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,140
found out I was because when I saw the

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,330
traffic drop I saw how much traffic by

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,880
my analytics and other tools were

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:58,020
picking up it was a lot of automated

00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,570
script traffic CDN is a content delivery

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,790
network with CD ends are designed not

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,830
primarily for security although they

00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:09,180
include some level of security by

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:11,010
default CDN is basically a copy of your

00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,930
site of your client site that has

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,250
distributed different servers all

00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,620
throughout the world and they're

00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,090
designed to reduce latency when someone

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,890
from Ireland must locate your site

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,600
you're going to hit a server a copy of

00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,670
that site environment rather than going

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,370
all the way to Chicago to get to it so

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:29,760
the mix of firewalls and CD ends are

00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:33,600
pretty good at reducing automated

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,400
malicious traffic in number five of the

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,640
simple website security tips is

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:42,330
continuous monitoring you want to have

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,190
some kind of a regular website security

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,730
scanner and there's different types of

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:50,520
scanners there's scanners can scan your

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,890
site looking at it as a browser would so

00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,540
from the outside in there's standards

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:58,410
which that you can connect to your

00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:00,540
server via FTP or SSH that will stand in

00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:04,650
actual files on your server looking for

00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:07,860
malicious software other hacks but some

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:10,110
kind of continuous monitoring so if you

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,370
just Google security standard you're

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,930
going to find a bunch of different

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:18,180
options there's there's no one that's

00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:20,250
better than the other the technical

00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,840
aspects of each one but this long

00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,140
interview is some kind of continue to

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,760
some 100 you can be alerted to anything

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,760
bad that might be happening outside

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,379
so including security in the project

00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:37,690
scope again this this goes right back to

00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:39,850
talking about security from the very

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,519
beginning right the first email or the

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,620
first phone call you can also continue

00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,080
that conversation of that education can

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,649
given if you include security as a line

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,259
item in the project scope process it

00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:55,749
gives you a more professional image in

00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:58,330
my opinion that you are then continuing

00:27:55,749 --> 00:28:01,059
that conversation you're positioning

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:04,450
yourself as someone who cares about

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:06,909
security but also you're building trust

00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:09,220
with your client because they will by

00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:12,669
default through this process know that

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,350
you actually give a damn about their

00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:15,940
business right you're not just there to

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,919
take their money and then send them on

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,710
their way you are there to grow their

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,159
business which then will grow you are so

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:26,369
it's about building trust as well you

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,929
could also include security as a service

00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:31,149
as I mentioned earlier focusing on

00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:33,369
security from the first contact and then

00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:35,499
in the project scope but you can also

00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:38,320
offer it into your maintenance plans as

00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:41,110
I mentioned so it looked like a number

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,690
of you are doing monthly care plans for

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,389
your clients if you're not I highly

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,009
recommend reading that service to your

00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:51,119
existing clients and into the clients

00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:55,210
and what maintenance plans mean

00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:59,200
practically it's pretty simple for us to

00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:05,139
do we go in and push buttons update or

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:08,169
update plugins themes to make sure you

00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:12,369
mitigate that - as well update always on

00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:14,679
the staging site so maintenance plan you

00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:16,990
can also offer security as an add-on

00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,700
service so what if

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,660
clients budget simply just doesn't allow

00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,450
for any kind of maintenance whether it's

00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:28,170
250 a month or they just can't pay it

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:32,590
they're starting out you can offer

00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:35,290
one-time security services so maybe

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,910
their site was hacked maybe it is a

00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,340
catalogue and they come to you go hey

00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:42,850
can you fix this that you can you can

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,860
use a service to clean it up and then

00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,110
charge them with an extra percentage you

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:50,830
can do a one-time hack you can do a

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:53,950
one-time half cleanup snooping you can

00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:56,290
do a one-time monitoring or standing for

00:29:53,950 --> 00:30:00,130
them to give them maybe a report every

00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:02,140
six months every month you can set up

00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,330
the Web Application Firewall for them if

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,750
they've decided that that's important to

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:10,330
them and they're paying for that through

00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:15,550
or whatever other service you can be the

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:17,080
technical so there's a couple of ways to

00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,270
automate the maintenance and reporting

00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,130
and if you're already doing that

00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,720
possibly you already are using some of

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,710
the tools that I'm going to show you

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,550
there

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:29,200
the first one is manage WP and if you're

00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:33,040
not familiar with manage WP it's

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:37,330
basically a unified dashboard where you

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:39,820
can connect multiple individual single

00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,190
WordPress installations and you get a

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,710
really good overview

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,659
so the terms of client work I've got 50

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,879
clients I can see every single sign on

00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:50,099
there I can see website has what

00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:54,059
software updates and then I can involve

00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:55,979
update WordPress core I could update

00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:58,889
plugins they can all like baked beans

00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:02,460
manage WP also comes with some security

00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:04,200
scanning included and what's really cool

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,019
about that service and others like

00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,779
infinite WP and this one watchful

00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:15,509
watchful the URL and they all come with

00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:18,090
some reporting included and then if you

00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:20,729
pay whatever cost you can brand that

00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:23,099
reporting so you can automate this whole

00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:24,479
maintenance system for your clients

00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:28,950
where you're going in you're literally

00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:30,269
spending an hour every month and let's

00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,789
say you have 50 plants and you're

00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:33,749
charging the 100 bucks a piece it's

00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:37,590
pretty easy money

00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:39,359
but it's also a really good way to make

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:43,109
sure that your client sites are as

00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,909
protected as they can be so let's talk

00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:50,190
about the benefits of a summary of a

00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:52,289
presentation so yeah I'd like you to

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,389
just try and remember these things to

00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:56,460
grow your business these are the bullet

00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:58,950
points secure your own site first the

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,200
lists that trust make sure that that

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:04,019
image is professional make sure that

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,080
you're not pushing clients away by

00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:09,239
mistake from their very first visit

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,349
learn the why how who and when of

00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:15,330
website security and that is basically

00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:19,769
why websites get attacked who's hacking

00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:21,979
them and why Sally and Bob's in their

00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:24,540
catalog are being targeted right

00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:26,850
communicate the business benefits effect

00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,830
that is talking to your clients about

00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:31,770
security in terms of they understand

00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:34,140
that their business really depends on

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,010
that portal it's like a brick and mortar

00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,070
store

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,240
it's just happens to be on the internet

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,830
include that talk of security from the

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,440
beginning all the way through to the

00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:45,000
project scope and if it doesn't work out

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,250
for maintenance planes you can offer it

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,070
as an optional service and I didn't

00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:52,710
mention this but you didn't even offer

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:55,050
security as required service or

00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,760
requirement to working with that's

00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,170
another way to set yourself apart you

00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,400
might lose a few clients but they're

00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:05,250
gonna make hire you're going to be able

00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,110
to demand higher project costs and then

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,780
finally automate that maintenance and

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:13,680
recording as much as you can to save you

00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:16,860
time so you can get more clients so

00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,730
that's what I have for you today does

00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,730
anyone have any questions

00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:39,990
so anyways so I have had a conversation

00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:42,809
with them and then they go I am a woman

00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,850
ago website in WordPress 10 so I don't

00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:46,620
have a good counter-argument to why you

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:54,120
would want to have a website the other

00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:57,149
way except so are you saying that

00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,130
because the clients have have heard that

00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:59,460
WordPress is insecure or that there's

00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,210
something

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:06,690
well the what I communicate to people

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,030
who have that opinion is that it does

00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,790
power over 30% of all sites on the

00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,649
internet there's a reason for that and

00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:16,710
because it powers so many sites it's an

00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:19,530
obvious target just like Equifax is a

00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,540
target for personal information it's

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,730
something that's unavoidable but the

00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,190
good part of that that I try to explain

00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,869
is that because it's so popular there

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,629
are so many thousands of people around

00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:35,099
the world focused on depending on the

00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:37,859
software that there's businesses that

00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,399
are exist to make sure that your site is

00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,280
secure

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,480
right so WordPress isn't less secure

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,990
than anything else

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,149
WordPress isn't less secure the hosting

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:53,619
service like weeks or server space right

00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:55,929
that's just so actually to back number

00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:59,200
two security security vulnerability and

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:01,420
policies so the point is and what I try

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,270
to communicate is that they think

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,609
WordPress is more than secure than

00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:11,650
anything else I try to let them know

00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:13,059
that that's not the truth yeah you're

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,650
talking you're talking about automating

00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:21,309
the maintenance portion the updates I'm

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:23,829
curious how much how much do you

00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:47,200
automate the updating of plugins for

00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:49,930
example I go into manage to BP every

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,210
week every Saturday morning and I look

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,089
for whatever days there are and whether

00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,680
it's for or plugins I'm doing that

00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:58,270
everything but so you are actually

00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,640
physically like you're updating you're

00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,770
not using a script or sir no I don't run

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,040
the update right matically on some sort

00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:09,400
of right I'm actually going and pressing

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,900
the button and for I'm just confused on

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,540
what you're asking because WordPress you

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,770
can automate it for software updates we

00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:20,330
don't have to push

00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:22,160
and physically they're following and

00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:27,160
physically doing them in each website

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,390
well I use managed WP for doing that but

00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,430
when you mentioned doing for would get

00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,790
attended like oh my god no no I do it in

00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,940
bulk

00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,950
yeah I take all the things I want

00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:43,850
updated or check all and I press a

00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:45,170
button and I first I run mangos yeah and

00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,940
then I look at those sites that make

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,790
sure they're not broken and the banjo

00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,640
Qian's is quick look restore no boom is

00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,820
that you incur backup okay so you can do

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,820
that

00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:52,369
well yes Wendell website happens and

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:56,930
it's learned every second of the day and

00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:56,930
wordpress vs. non wordpress

00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,990
I know the w3 Tech's is it they're the

00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:05,990
ones that come out with the report

00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:15,109
another service

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,850
