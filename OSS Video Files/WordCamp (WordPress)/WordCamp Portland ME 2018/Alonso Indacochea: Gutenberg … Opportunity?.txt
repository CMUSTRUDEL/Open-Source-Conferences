Title: Alonso Indacochea: Gutenberg … Opportunity?
Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	The new visual editor sure does inspire consternation in the WordPress community. As with any disruption, there will be winners and losers in professional world – and lots of questions. Instead of focusing on launch and transition issues, I’ll describe how I believe the fundamentals of the WordPress experience will change for both the end-user AND the professional – and discuss potential opportunities for businesses in the WordPress ecosystem.

so hey guys my name is Alonso and my

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:16,480
talk is about some of the opportunities

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:23,350
that I see with Gutenberg and work for

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:25,030
WordPress 5.0 and so I wanted to just

00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,390
let you know I know there's some people

00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:32,649
kind of get anxious asking questions

00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:36,400
sort of in person feel free if you have

00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:41,190
a question during the presentation text

00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,190
that number and at the end I'll try and

00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:49,360
answer all the questions I get through

00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:52,530
text just a little bit about me I'm CEO

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,020
of 11 online we're an agency in

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,309
Albuquerque New Mexico do a lot of

00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,860
WordPress work would do a lot of other

00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:04,180
stuff too

00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:08,979
we started block party this year

00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,780
WP block top party check it out I've

00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:14,530
been working with WordPress since 2015

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,060
it's not that long and WordPress is

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,100
still actually an important part of our

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,079
business even though we do lots and lots

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,499
of things these days and in New Mexico

00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:27,130
when your software development shop and

00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:29,590
you want a scale you've got to do lots

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,279
of different things it's it's a 48th

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,929
poorest state in the Union I think so

00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:38,259
you know you gotta do lots of things to

00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:39,819
to get by for those of you that don't

00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:43,450
know but I assume you know at this stage

00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:47,529
because was the 19th I think it's gonna

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,869
become part of your clients realities

00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:51,909
and your realities what's good and

00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:57,369
forgets the new WordPress editor as of

00:01:51,909 --> 00:02:01,989
November 19 5.0 although I've learned to

00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:04,029
be somewhat skeptical of dates it's the

00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:07,869
first sort of iteration of block party

00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:11,980
we built in April which I think was the

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:14,660
first kind of goal day we've been really

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,569
nice if it would have come out

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,940
but yes so it's a you know what you see

00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:22,520
is what you get experience on the admin

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,459
side that the paradigm is blocks which

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,630
is very different Gutenberg comes with

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:31,220
simple blocks you but you can use custom

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,890
blocks to build custom blocks use

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,319
third-party blocks and of course there's

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,180
a lot of implementation controversy does

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,750
how many just raise your hands if you

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,630
know a little bit about that okay wow

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,940
that's interesting I've done this talk

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,590
number of times or variations of it a

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,250
number of times at other work camps this

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:56,569
year and almost always no one raises

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,650
this interesting in any case so first

00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,549
thing we're gonna do is that do a little

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,549
demo for you

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:10,310
Boston guys this is typically what

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:20,480
happens to me when I do demos sorry Red

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:22,940
Sox yeah yeah yeah well I'm a Mets fan

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,190
as you're about to find out so maybe

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:31,540
that's sort of doubly but yeah yeah you

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:38,660
guys you guys are doing fine sooo yeah

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:43,700
okay there we go no this wasn't gonna be

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:46,280
mirrored okay so I just put together a

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,400
pretty simple demo post and in fact when

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,630
you install Gutenberg as a plugin

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,540
there's a drop-down feature you'll see

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,389
it's right here down here and it says

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,910
demo and you can access like a demo post

00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:02,389
and it shows off you know the default

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:04,250
blocks and I just yeah and and I think

00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,650
most people's understanding of what

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,810
Gutenberg is what the new editor is is

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,660
is more that and the simple sort of

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,829
blocks that come with good bird right

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,350
you know this is like a cover block

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,519
there's a there's a YouTube block you

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,900
know there's there's all this kind of

00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,870
stuff you might expect that would come

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,970
along but what I want to show you is a

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,349
little bit more of some of the blocks

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,400
that we've been building over the last

00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,740
year and

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,990
maybe you know what's what's possible

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,699
because I think probably most people

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,490
haven't really seen what's what's

00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:38,900
possible with with custom blocks and

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:42,949
third-party blocks so so there's a yes

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,880
so there's this which is we built in one

00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,210
of the things we were thinking about is

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,870
okay well how can we use some of the you

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:53,210
know possibilities of Gutenberg to you

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,889
know build you know just just trying it

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,660
out testing it out to build like sort of

00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:01,490
common web UI right so you know you've

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,710
seen this on million websites the

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,850
pricing table right so this is a this is

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,530
actually a good bird block you know you

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,520
can do a lot with it again it's what you

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,300
see is what you get

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,669
you can add details add buttons add

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,100
links and then there's you know block

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:22,460
settings over here again like per month

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,639
per year what kind of currency there's a

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,199
little bit of styling stuff we you know

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,200
again we built some of these blocks just

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,660
to see how it worked and test things out

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,310
I don't necessarily think you want to

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,740
give if you're an agency you don't want

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,000
to give your clients so many options but

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:45,020
it's possible in Gutenberg and

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,410
especially styling options clients all

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,990
right often times not designers and

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:54,260
don't make really ugly stuff if you let

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,289
them but uh but anyway so so you know

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,000
this is kind of what it looks like

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:02,539
you know pricing table what it looks

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,120
like on the back end and if you see what

00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:10,940
it looks like here on the front end you

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,430
know it's it's almost identical and it's

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,389
truly you're editing in the block and

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,580
it's truly what you see is what you get

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,410
so okay so that you know again these are

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,970
kind of that's more of a presentation

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:27,830
block so what I want to do is I want to

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,430
show you guys like so this is like my

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:35,240
sample baseball nerd post I'm a baseball

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,740
guy a sports guy in general and you know

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,510
I really

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm a big met fan that came to the

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,620
States in 85 saw the Mets win the World

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,820
Series in a six and then been

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:49,190
disappointed for the next 32 years but

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,870
so anyway so you know one of the one of

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,760
the things we're in sort of use cases we

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:57,410
were thinking of as you know I I read a

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,700
lot of sports blogs and you know one of

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,050
the things I noticed and a lot of these

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,540
sports blog is that the data

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:07,340
visualizations were really poor simple

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:09,500
sort of screenshotted or not very

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,030
dynamic and so I thought what wouldn't

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,930
be cool to build a block that would let

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:19,910
you know people create dynamic data

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:21,970
visualizations right and so you know

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,800
we've made a bunch of these blocks with

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,180
Google data charts right and so let me

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,320
just show you what it kind of looks like

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,050
on the you know in in in the editor

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,600
right so you click on the block and then

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,150
you have this you know you can set the

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,620
title you actually set it up to where

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,900
you can pull data from Google sheets

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,330
it's pretty cool so you can have a

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,340
Google sheet and then then just but this

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,560
is just if you wanted to set up a pie

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,560
chart right there in the block you have

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,220
names values you can set colors the

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,430
controls you can slice you cannot you

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,320
know explode a slice right and so forth

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,970
and then this is my pie chart of how you

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,970
become a met fan right

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,570
you know 32 percent masochist I don't

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,950
know if that's accurate that's just you

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:15,200
know this is one of my favorites is you

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,870
hate your dad who love the Yankees so

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,680
it's some sort of rebellion or something

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,690
right and oddly attracted to mr. Matt so

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,880
anyway you can like kind of you know

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,680
like you can kind of set settings here a

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,790
set you know set them 3d again this is

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,380
using Google's charts API so it's not

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,420
actually the most sophisticated thing

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,720
someday we want to rebuild them using

00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:41,180
something like d3 or and give people a

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,160
little bit more options but again this

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,660
was just sort of you're like thinking

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,520
okay well what's what's possible what

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,740
can we do

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,730
within here and then you know

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,090
what you get on this side is you get a

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:57,450
you know you get a really dynamic

00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:00,280
cool-looking data visualization and

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,780
again it's in in the post in it you get

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,550
it great you know because of what good

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,340
work can do you get a preview on the

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,290
admin site that's actually matches what

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,060
it looks like I mean have you guys ever

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:14,050
done data visualizations and in

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,400
WordPress in the content those options

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,280
you have are pretty limited they're

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,960
short code base tour and certainly

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,870
you're not getting previews and things

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:30,490
like that so again this is a this is a

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:33,370
line chart block that we made charting

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:37,560
Mets losses as a met fan you focus on

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:40,720
that right if someone was telling me

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,960
someone who's telling me that I'm a

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:50,050
sports Catholic right there's a lot

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:52,660
guilt sadness but bit anyway so so yeah

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:57,340
so again on the you know on the headsman

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,860
side right names values controls you can

00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,390
title the axes the axes you get a

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,500
preview you have lots and lots of

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:08,650
settings here you can curve you know you

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,000
do area again and and so you know all

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,000
this stuff is using google charts

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,990
and yeah like I said this what it looks

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,880
like so and and you know again we were

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,090
playing around just thinking about like

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,550
okay what's different web UI right you

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,800
know different web UI that we we could

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,330
play around with sliders carousels

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,410
whatever you want to call them it's not

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:39,920
our favorite stuff clients love them but

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:42,260
you know I'm sort of dubious as to the

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,100
effectiveness of these maybe sex certain

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:49,940
use cases but you know have you guys

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:53,690
ever built a carousel or slider using a

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,370
plug-in in WordPress what I mean

00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,980
typically what's what's the experience

00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,050
like and what what kinds of stuff do you

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:07,040
guys use I don't know I'm just throwing

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:13,370
it out there anyone yeah okay revolution

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,550
slider right yeah do do it do they yeah

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,690
do a well so my experience with that

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:24,170
plug-in is that there are a million

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:27,140
settings right and also uh you know I

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,480
don't know do search on Panama papers

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,120
and Revolution sliders

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,880
they'll be interesting anyway but yes so

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,310
my experience of using sliders of

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,740
building sliders for clients is just

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,870
that the the experience of putting

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,160
together a slider adding images to a

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:49,900
slider or tweaking settings is complex

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:52,610
and difficult and not user-friendly and

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:57,350
so we tried to do is we tried to build

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,330
as like simple as possible a slider

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:03,110
block where you could just you know very

00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:05,780
simply add images trash images change

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:09,680
settings it's like in the right in the

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,900
block itself right and and you know give

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,200
give some give some user options right

00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,600
indicator is not indicators etc again

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,700
this is just kind of like proof of

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,200
concept you know as you can see of

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,830
course focus on all the greats that

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,410
we're screwing up or messed up

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:33,290
you know we traded Nolan Ryan beautiful

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,940
but anyway so and then again here's

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,390
another one that's just it's just a

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,960
pop-up amodal that's a block right just

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,330
common you know common web UI so this is

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,610
what it looks like

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,770
you know on this side you can title you

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,770
can title it you can put in other blocks

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:54,170
as content this is kind of cool you can

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:59,630
change like animations and it gives you

00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:01,880
a little preview right anyway let's see

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,680
what else oh yeah this is the statistic

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,450
if you should probably seen that one

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,910
right like number of cups of coffee you

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:14,420
know I don't know how people use this

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:18,110
stuff for I don't know but again it's on

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:20,030
this side so I think we did we did on

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,550
this side we did yeah so we you can do

00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:25,130
it we have a like a we have a count up

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:28,300
animation that you can set like when you

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:31,190
slide down when you you know scroll down

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,610
this is a this is like under this is

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,860
like super super under development it's

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:39,370
it's a scatter chart again so the reason

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,540
I show you this is yes to brag but also

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,740
also to kind of give you the

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,240
understanding of what's possible I think

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,090
frankly from a communication standpoint

00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,200
I don't think that that's been really

00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:57,110
communicated and you know what what the

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,700
possibilities are for you know users to

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:04,040
actually be able to create rich content

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:06,130
on their own in the other day and you

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,740
know the kind of the possibilities are

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,480
endless you know and even even right now

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,640
there's lots and lots of stuff you can

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,950
do and and you know the product still

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:23,580
kind of in development not even part of

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:27,570
core yet okay I think that's

00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:30,260
I think that's that so if I can get to

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,260
my screen here

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,210
oh here we go

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,210
[Music]

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:48,090
there we go so yeah I know okay no

00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:50,160
baseball through the like some of the

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,870
benefits for content creators as I see

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,930
them you know what you see is what you

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:58,260
got for real finally in the editor I

00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,850
mean you know tiny MCE people are they

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,530
date often say it's what you see is what

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,590
yet but any of us that's actually ever

00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:10,020
used tiny MCE and wordpress knows that

00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:11,640
that's oftentimes not the case you know

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,620
like it's you can make custom blocks to

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,000
you know create content that would rich

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,980
content that would be either be very

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,040
difficult or impossible or the user

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:24,570
experience would be very kind of junky

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,310
you know potentially down the line and

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,020
and that's why I include a link here to

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,360
the roadmap potentially down the line I

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,840
think you know as a product sort of

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,990
mature as this is feature matures it

00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,060
could either replace page builders or

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,290
just serve as a sort of built in page

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:46,050
builder which i think is kind of cool

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:50,850
you know no disrespect to page builders

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:54,480
don't know who are the sponsors yeah

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,700
both great both both grid is awesome but

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,850
uh but yeah so you know that that's

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,700
another potential okay you know changes

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,560
for software developers right it's react

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,880
and it's you know it's very JavaScript

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,340
oriented

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,680
I think theme development for Gutenberg

00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,020
you know using and taking advantage of

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,990
Gutenberg and goomar blocks is going to

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:20,720
change the paradigm is again gonna be

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:22,710
block centric and I'm excited to see how

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,380
people kind of develop those workflows

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:29,520
and those processes because that's

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:32,100
internally right now by my company you

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,780
know I don't want to focus on the

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,420
controversy and the reason I don't want

00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,910
to focus on it is not to dismiss like

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,920
completely valid criticisms we don't

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:44,130
think it's perfect by any stretch and

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,810
there's miles to go I think before it's

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:51,840
uh you know it's it's mature certainly I

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,160
just I want to focus on the

00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,250
opportunities

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,020
because I'm an entrepreneur right so I

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:06,300
want I want to kind of stick more to

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:10,320
that stuff you know so you know I want

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:13,620
and and I think you know okay I think

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:17,660
that that in WordPress if you look at

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:21,150
the ecosystem it's a been a fairly

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,790
stable ecosystem right there you know

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:28,050
tons of waves are not made and a lot of

00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:29,880
that is purposeful but if you look at

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,930
what's what's happening with Gutenberg

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,970
in the new editor

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,080
and by the way eventually we're not even

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,710
gonna be talking about Gutenberg is just

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,570
gonna be the other I see it as the

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,270
biggest disruption in in the WordPress

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:46,200
ecosystem in quite a long time maybe

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:49,950
custom post types maybe more maybe

00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,920
bigger than that and so as an

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:55,980
entrepreneur as somebody that's

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,430
interested and continuing to grow and

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,620
scale my company I see disruptions in

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,540
this ecosystem that we've been a part of

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:09,270
for the last you know three almost four

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:10,890
years and I get really excited I get

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,620
really really excited because these are

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,680
the sorts of opportunities that allow

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:20,130
smaller possibly more flexible agencies

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,330
like us to start offering you know

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:26,370
different kinds of products and services

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:27,050
that maybe other companies can't or

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,880
won't

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,700
so it creates it creates disruption and

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,820
it creates opportunities and and yes

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,030
there is controversy and yes there are

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,890
completely valid criticisms and you know

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:47,580
again we can go on and on about that but

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:48,780
I like it when people get mad I just see

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:54,330
that there's an opportunity

00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:56,180
so let's brainstorm I've talked a little

00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,190
bit about some of the things that I see

00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,800
possibly for agencies but I want to ask

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,309
you guys to sort of contribute and think

00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,340
where you guys are

00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:09,159
let's say if you're freelancers or you

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,659
maintain a lot of sites or you know what

00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,509
kind of whatever your role or position

00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:14,919
is in the ecosystem what are some what

00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:21,629
are some opportunities business

00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:21,629
opportunities with this disruption yes

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,460
yeah I mean yeah so I think there there

00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:53,349
are going to be issues right for lots of

00:19:51,460 --> 00:20:04,349
sites and I think there's definitely

00:19:53,349 --> 00:20:04,349
going to be opportunities there yeah

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,539
right but but but I guess my my whole

00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:12,330
thing with that is right so you know if

00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,830
you're maintaining sites right as

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,320
someone that maintaining sites that you

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,489
have the responsibility of preparing for

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,129
these kinds of things right it's just

00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:22,570
this is part of what you do I think a

00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:24,070
lot of times people look at maintaining

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:28,450
sites and business and maintaining sites

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:30,970
as free money like you know update core

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:34,090
update plugins and the money rolls in

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,909
and so ya know so you actually have to

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:39,009
work right you have to plan for you know

00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:40,749
major upgrades and how things are gonna

00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:42,759
change you know and you have to price

00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:44,379
accordingly so you know people are

00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,729
worried about the III think that's

00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:46,720
Larry's to me people worried about the

00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:50,830
phone ringing off the hook

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,299
that's awesome you know and you know if

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,009
you're if you're billing by the hour

00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,649
that's even more awesome

00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:58,749
but but yeah certainly they're gonna be

00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:02,739
great opportunities in helping people

00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:06,169
transition if their site has potential

00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:08,959
issues with the upgrade for sure yes

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:12,029
probably an obvious answer would be

00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:15,209
premium blocks companies coming out with

00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:19,739
really advanced guttenberg blocks and

00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:23,489
more to that grouping those blocks into

00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:25,409
a certain so maybe it's copyright or

00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:28,709
maybe it's designer based in commerce

00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:32,059
huge opportunity there from our

00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:35,299
perspective related in business but

00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:35,299
preparing our

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:45,649
any product because it's when Gutenberg

00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:50,329
hits and you're going that's ready to

00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:53,199
have some marketing fodder right your

00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:53,199
competitors don't

00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:03,180
yeah yeah absolutely and I think with

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:05,800
with with the with the premium blocks I

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,480
mean again I just showed you and then

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,520
that's really the tip of the iceberg

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,430
actually those blocks aren't you know

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,050
that sophisticated I mean for us we we

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,760
do a lot of react stuff we do a lot of

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:20,770
business solution application stuff I

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,620
took one of our developers the pie chart

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,240
block it took my Road developers a day

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,670
more or less to do most of the work and

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,430
and that day was also what is Gutenberg

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:33,750
how the hell does this thing work etc so

00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:36,010
so you know these aren't actually

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,230
tremendous on you is actually not all

00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:41,920
that sophisticated so I'm really excited

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,720
to see how far you can take it and I

00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,400
think yeah there's no doubt there's

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,400
tremendous opportunities than that yes

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,840
especially the correct solution that

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:05,260
most people go to is you take your

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:10,510
wonderful visualized data make them deep

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:13,360
file and then give some alt taxing yeah

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,560
so like the Python example where on the

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,840
back end you've got all the data points

00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:21,760
it's just it's not that block with

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,900
accessibility controls in it so that's

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,910
some bandits approaching it with a

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,440
screen reader that's the opportunity to

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,760
go to that Google sheet and look at the

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,540
digested

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,760
I think that's an awesome point I mean I

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:38,100
that and it's not really something I've

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,870
thought a ton about but I think it's an

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,040
awesome point especially in light of the

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,630
sort of there's this kind of

00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,600
accessibility controversy around

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,370
Gutenberg at which I think is there are

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,380
many many valid points there that

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,110
there's many valid points I'm not trying

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,930
to dismiss that at all but in that use

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:58,320
case right the possibility is there yeah

00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:02,220
right and I you know I have a cousin

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,800
who's blind so I've seen how he uses

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,600
like the Internet and and yeah you know

00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,940
that's it definitely makes you sensitive

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,220
to the fact that yeah if you're yeah

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,990
exactly you're putting a PNG that says

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,760
pie-chart

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:17,580
okay well what good does that serve you

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,530
know my cousin for example so so I think

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:23,400
ya know certainly in that use case it's

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:26,400
oh it's a great great example of being

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,680
able to have the ability to get empower

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,820
users to have a more accessible web and

00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,820
create more accessible content for sure

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,820
yes

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:24,110
yeah I agree one of the things that you

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,360
know I think about a lot is you know

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,480
with with with page builders right it

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,940
gives it one of the one of the so you

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,620
know people especially in WordPress

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,299
development you know complain about page

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,940
builders a lot right one of the things

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:41,539
that's interesting to me is I completely

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:44,990
understand why they exist right they

00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:48,500
exist for a reason and users sort of

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:50,840
demanded a better experience building

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,929
pages then WordPress kind of offers them

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,370
out of the gate and and and you know one

00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:58,220
of the one of the things I know a lot of

00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:01,129
agencies that use page builders and you

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,090
know they create these custom elements

00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:07,220
right that are branded styled

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:10,610
consistently right and so and reusable

00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,690
and I think that that paradigm I get it

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,909
it makes sense right

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,730
so you want to empower content managers

00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:20,269
to stay within branding guidelines right

00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,919
so I think that the again I don't know

00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:26,350
if it's there yet but the possibilities

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,350
are there for sure yeah

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:40,580
that I think doesn't get enough

00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:45,590
conversation lately which is that the

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:49,490
editor is first and Gutenberg the long

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,010
term vision gets to have me a non

00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:55,780
developer

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:59,650
designer bah you use blocks to create an

00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:02,340
entire website from scratch so what's

00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:06,440
going to happen in two themes are

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,440
the necessary part

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,660
well and so so I mean I don't know if

00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,740
you guys saw her know about this but so

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:22,360
wpengine recently acquired array themes

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,420
do you guys know or ratings and rate

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,220
themes actually they've they created

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,260
this product called atomic blocks that

00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,280
were one of the first they're one of the

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:36,820
first collection of blocks came out in

00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:40,210
April or around them they're really

00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:43,690
really smart those guys they made they

00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:45,340
made a new at Guttenberg news site right

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,910
where they a granade adalah sort of

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,350
Gutenberg stuff and then and then came

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,940
out with their product that you know

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,760
they featured on the Gutenberg news site

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,130
and and you know their blocks are really

00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,190
they're they're really kind of designed

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:03,280
forward and and but primarily

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,110
presentation blocks and yeah so wpengine

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,610
acquired array themes atomic blocks and

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:11,290
good bird news and you know you see a

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,260
lot of these hosting companies that

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,690
they're they're starting to think about

00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,000
what how they're going to approach this

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,960
and what are their what are the

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,640
solutions that they're gonna be offering

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,810
they're their clients so you know I've

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,790
definitely looked at that and thought

00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:31,110
you know it's myself there there's

00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:33,300
tremendous tremendous opportunity in

00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:37,810
some of these bigger companies taking

00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:42,610
making bets and how you know because at

00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:44,890
the end of the day who's WordPress for

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:48,460
right at the end of the day who is

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:51,910
WordPress for end users right and so so

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:55,870
as long as we get to a place where the

00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:58,540
end user experience is better and people

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:02,340
are more empowered as far as I'm

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:04,600
concerned that's all I care about and if

00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,430
you know if there are sort of

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,580
entrepreneurial opportunities to create

00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,140
those better user experiences easier and

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,200
you know sort of empowering user

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,200
experiences and I'm all about that and

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,920
frankly we don't as an agency we don't

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,540
need to do work

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,910
press work anymore but I there's

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,580
something about this ecosystem where I

00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:32,800
think it's an enormous ecosystem with an

00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:34,210
enormous user base and you know there's

00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,440
there are tremendous tremendous

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:43,030
opportunities in there and again

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,640
disruption disruption to me is its is

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,380
awesome for an entrepreneur and I just

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,200
if you know if you take anything away

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,390
from this talk it's it's just it's fine

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,910
to be sort of outraged it's fine to have

00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,670
like you know criticisms it's fine to be

00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:01,660
skeptical all those things are great but

00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:03,790
if you're an entrepreneur be

00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,400
entrepreneurial you know turn that

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,930
around you know whatever you know even

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,180
even kind of coming from the other side

00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:13,120
right like you see like the you know

00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:16,270
classic press fork right there's nothing

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,040
nothing wrong with a fork it probably

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,040
wouldn't have existed if this project

00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,150
would have gone the way it did all right

00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,220
so there's always there's always

00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:29,590
opportunities out there so we'll open it

00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,420
up for questions here's some links to

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:36,750
three of the blocks I demoed they're

00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:38,890
free so if you want to download them

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,730
play them play around with them they're

00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:47,220
all on github and if there's a problem

00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:51,790
or an issue please put in a pull request

00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:53,320
or send me an email I don't know but

00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:58,900
yeah so anyway and there's my

00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:00,370
information that's a link to the slides

00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,980
but you probably don't need the slides

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:07,050
there's not a ton there so anyway yeah

00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:10,050
that's it any questions thoughts ideas

00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,050
yes

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:39,840
and it's show which sort of a question

00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:42,180
you don't that come on

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,590
like are you talking about like are you

00:31:42,180 --> 00:32:14,640
talking about custom like block

00:31:43,590 --> 00:32:16,440
development yeah I think I think there's

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,720
there is a learning curve from from the

00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,160
standpoint of like you know there's a

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,460
certain way that people are accustomed

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,200
to working with a classic editor that

00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,910
you know you're gonna have to learn new

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,130
sort of workflows and there's there's

00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,770
something there if you're talking about

00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,110
like if you're talking about custom

00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:36,030
block development you're gonna have to

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:40,020
be really really comfortable with

00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:43,710
JavaScript react and there's so there's

00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,170
a lot of stuff there but if you're just

00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:49,530
talking about like trying to build rich

00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:51,090
content and posts it should be you know

00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:55,260
it should be something where just try it

00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:57,420
out experiment figure it out I don't

00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,160
think it's that bad I'm biased I've been

00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,520
using it for quite a while now and so

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,990
I've started to kind of a lot of the

00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,030
things a lot of the sort of quirks of it

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:10,550
or you know sort of automatic at this

00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,550
stage but no pun intended yes

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:20,980
I've been doing whatever your host is if

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,230
they provide a stating sight opportunity

00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:26,470
to make a copy of those client sites you

00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,840
have on the live site install and

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,580
activate the classic editor plugin so we

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,530
do bird drops if they're not going to be

00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,780
a

00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:37,410
be business as usual but if you create a

00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:40,050
copy on the staging site and then start

00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,760
playing with those copies that will set

00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:46,190
your that your learning curve is going

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:52,000
to be shortened by quite a bit and

00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:52,000
ready and more ready than just us

00:33:52,709 --> 00:34:24,339
yeah don't be create your sandbox and

00:33:57,219 --> 00:34:26,889
don't be afraid and I mean classic

00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:29,740
editor as a page builder is awesome and

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:33,460
that's why page builders exist right

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:37,059
right so so I mean I mean you know I

00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,559
think to me like you know where there's

00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:40,210
a lot of debate about what you know as

00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:43,720
Gutenberg better in the classic editor

00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:45,250
it is in creating like post content yeah

00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,799
but again like again I think what people

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,990
don't they're not seeing the

00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:52,569
possibilities it's like you know it's

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,950
like when you're in a small you know

00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:56,319
you're in this sort of paradigm of

00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:58,240
WordPress in the classic editor you just

00:34:56,319 --> 00:35:02,289
kind of start constraining what you

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,720
think you can do right and and also to

00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:08,259
be fair like I I just haven't seen a lot

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,420
of blocks out there people are waiting

00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:12,339
or whatever it is I haven't seen a lot

00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,980
of blocks out there that push it and

00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:19,119
challenge you know challenge sort of the

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:20,890
limits and you know are creative and

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,779
introduce like more advanced

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,930
functionalities and have more dynamic

00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:27,970
sort of outcomes

00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:30,369
you know I've maybe part of it for me is

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:32,410
that you know we might company we've

00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:35,319
built a lot of just business solutions

00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,750
stuff where we're having to make it up

00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:41,730
and and you know that the constraint is

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,730
time and budget right

00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,779
yeah yeah this is like this honestly

00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:52,539
this is our company fun side project for

00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:55,980
the last like nine yeah something like

00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:55,980
nine months something like yes

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,950
technically well yeah so it good it's a

00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,370
great question

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:12,380
so yeah it's on our block party site and

00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,240
we've built a bunch of custom blocks

00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,680
there there's a block that Endon shows

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,710
there's an accordion I think it's the

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,360
FAQ and stuff I got from a performance

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,460
standpoint it really is gonna depend on

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,310
what your truck like what page what's

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:28,010
the content what you're gonna do with it

00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:32,900
the fact that it's just a lot of HTML or

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:35,540
you know this it's bloat it that's it oh

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:39,260
yeah I'm happy to talk to you about that

00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:41,150
after Kurt no no no yeah yeah no I know

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:45,260
what you're saying I think there are

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:54,310
advantages and disadvantages but yeah I

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:56,600
go into it more detail after oh yeah

00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:00,220
that's I mean that's cool that that

00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,220
means for some businesses that's just

00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:10,490
yeah I think so like what I would tell

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:13,100
your guys your developers are is just I

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:16,330
mean that might be the right sort of

00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,740
strategy for right now but you're just

00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:21,050
delay yeah it's just like you know it's

00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,750
like at some point and you know honestly

00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,880
for from my standpoint the that great

00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:28,610
the tremendous like talented software

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,250
developers that I've met they're excited

00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:35,090
by new tech and new challenges and you

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:39,140
know so you know this whole like fear

00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:44,180
thing is is it's it's a little bit weird

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:46,220
for me in tech because we you know I

00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,890
don't know like again we're a generalist

00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,330
shop and we're in New Mexico so we we

00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,430
end up doing stuff like building like

00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:54,770
wearable applications and random things

00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,480
you know like an in tech we don't we

00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,930
don't have a ton of experience in but

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,710
it's just like okay hey we're developers

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:06,500
we'll figure it out so so I don't know

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:10,960
maybe that's more like our sort of

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:14,270
paradigm what we what we do anybody else

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,740
like I said oh wait did anyone text me

00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:20,660
no one texted me okay

00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:24,140
yeah if you have questions feel free to

00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,010
email me text me or whatever to come

00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,750
