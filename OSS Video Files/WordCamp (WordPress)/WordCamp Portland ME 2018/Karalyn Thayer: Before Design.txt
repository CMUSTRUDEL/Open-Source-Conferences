00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,410
this let me get a survey how many of you

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,820
are designers okay how many of you are

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:25,140
small business owners okay great and any

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:28,619
developers okay and any other categories

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,340
I might have missed just learning

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,289
perfect great it's good to know so this

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,829
isn't so I'll start with introducing

00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:42,510
myself my name is Carolyn Thayer I'm a

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,699
UI UX designer and I'm a teacher's

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,519
assistant at skill crush comm I'm based

00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:50,280
out of Portland Maine feel free if you

00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:53,309
think of any questions to hit me up on

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,709
email or send me a tweet but I'll take

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,269
questions after - so the goals of this

00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:04,379
presentation so this is going to be an

00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:06,720
entry-level presentation before you

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,340
create a website you need a plan you

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,740
don't want to just open up Photoshop and

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,810
start throwing around colors and fonts

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,370
you need to know what you're doing it's

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,810
gonna save you time and money well you

00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,550
could just open up Photoshop but it's

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,810
gonna cost you a lot more money and a

00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,570
lot more time and you're gonna have a

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,250
lot more expensive mistakes so the goals

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,900
of this talk is to give you the tools to

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,060
create a roadmap for your website

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,470
whether you're building your own site or

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,000
you're working on a client site or

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,470
you're working with a designer agency

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,240
you're a small business you're working

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,220
with someone just knowing the process

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,860
knowing the steps you can take before

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,300
you talk to a designer this is gonna

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,490
give you a launch point to build a

00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,920
successful website you might not need to

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,570
use all of the methods every time that

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,340
I'm going to talk about but you have

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,740
like a toolbox that you can reach into

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,570
and grab something that will fit your

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:58,800
project all right so the first thing I'm

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:01,170
going to talk about is user personas so

00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,750
I'd like to say that a user persona is a

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,640
snapshot of a fictional person who

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,610
represents research done on a major

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,409
group of people visiting your website so

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,230
user personas give you a useful metric

00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:15,030
to design and critique your site with so

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,430
rather than having to remember the

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,659
details of many users

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,400
you're looking at your site through the

00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,230
lens of three to five fictional

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,450
characters this tool is really useful

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,730
then when you have to make sure that a

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,519
user accomplishes a certain goal such as

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:32,689
buy a product call a number find

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:37,099
directions and what makes a good user

00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:39,349
persona so a good user persona focuses

00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:42,310
on your intended audience while it's

00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:44,720
possible to have multiple audiences

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,400
however if you're asked a question who

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,079
is your business targeting and the

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,810
answer is everyone you're not actually

00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,340
targeting anyone so you want to kind of

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,349
narrow it down between one and three

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,590
categories of people who are using your

00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,329
product or service really knowing your

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,420
users and their needs is going to help

00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:04,189
you make effective design decisions as

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,489
much as possible your persona should be

00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:08,739
based on actual research so this makes

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,599
your job easier if it's an existing

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,220
business or company you're able to do

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,569
research it's a little harder if it's

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,420
brand new you have to make some

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,879
assumptions look at your competitors but

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,829
as much as you can not make assumptions

00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,650
or make assumptions and validate them

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:26,480
with research like analytics or if it's

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,489
a physical location surveying people who

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,889
walk in the door any of that sort that's

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,620
gonna help you out and a good user

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,510
persona should be realistic this one's

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,970
really important so while it's okay to

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,430
be aspirational you want to keep your

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,260
decisions based in reality for example

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,569
if you're creating a persona for a

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,199
non-profit that typically receives many

00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:49,819
25 to $100 donations you don't want to

00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,349
make a persona that's a millionaire

00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:53,599
looking to give away their life savings

00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:56,120
that's not gonna happen and that persona

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,729
is not going to help you and personas

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,889
are also great for creating empathy so

00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:05,090
if you say when you're citing making a

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,430
design decision and you're studying

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,349
research sometimes that's really hard

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,510
with your stakeholders to create empathy

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:14,030
so you're saying well 45% of people

00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,130
using cellphones but if you have mark

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,049
uses a cell phone and you can tell a

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,000
story about mark you look he's on the go

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,310
in his car and he's pulling out his

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,870
phone that's gonna build empathy and be

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,060
easier for all your stakeholders to

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:30,400
understand so this is a

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,990
a free user persona template I just

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,450
grabbed off a website but there's lots

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,490
of user persona templates out there they

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,700
can be super complicated in detail they

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,380
can be very simple I'll send out a link

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,930
to this at the end of the presentation

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,730
but a good persona is gonna help you

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,870
pinpoint your users goals that's what

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,560
it's gonna focus on what are their goals

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,760
a little bit about their demographics

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,470
some important things to consider for

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,720
your persona include what their pain

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,330
points are and what frustrates and

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,210
delight your users and also some general

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,890
demographic information also because

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,380
again we're using these personas to

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,930
build empathy naming them something like

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,400
John Doe and making it really generic is

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,740
not gonna build that same level of

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,140
empathy as just building a more

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,910
well-rounded persona so the more you can

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,370
make them feel like a real person based

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,680
on a large amount of data the more

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,710
you're gonna build that empathy and have

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,660
really want to build a good product for

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:31,210
your user all right so how do we use

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,460
these fancy personas you asked and

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,770
having made up these fictional

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,870
characters we have a snapshot of our key

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,210
audience we've built empathy with them

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:45,160
and they're now more than just facts in

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:48,070
figures so here are two case studies two

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,810
samples here this is for an online

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:54,520
grocery shopping store they want to

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,260
build an app or a website and what they

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,030
did is they surveyed a whole bunch of

00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,220
their customers they talked to people we

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,320
talked to cashiers coming in and they

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,780
want to add an online delivery to their

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,370
website so this grocery store looked at

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,050
their online analytics they surveyed

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,120
in-person customers they talked to their

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,340
cashiers and they decided that they have

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,490
to keeper sona's we have Joyce here on

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,250
the Left she's 75 she mostly uses a

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,140
desktop computer she's retired she lives

00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,810
by herself in apartment downtown she

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,180
doesn't drive she struggles with lugging

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,370
groceries home and her goal is to get

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,340
basic supplies easily without relying on

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:33,610
outside help something she might say is

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,380
it's not worth the hassle and then we

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,550
also have Laura Smith shopping at the

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,130
same grocery store

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,720
she has an intermediate tech level she

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,670
uses an iPhone 8 she's

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,370
39 she lives in a residential

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,590
neighborhood she has three children she

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,960
spends a lot of time driving around she

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,300
wants to pay the shop local and she

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,220
wants she'd pay more for organic brands

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,490
and she wants to save time without

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,200
sacrificing quality

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,300
so can anyone think looking at these if

00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,250
you had to make design decisions what

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,840
are some things you might think of that

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,660
based on these that you'd make for an

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:24,460
online marketing store or an online

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:26,140
grocery delivery service yes exactly

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,760
any other things that you can think of

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,680
based on these personas that you'd want

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,590
to make sure your online delivery

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,590
includes any features for your product

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,580
that's a good yes

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,540
yeah those are all great things and so

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,760
through these we've had empathy versus

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,970
just saying a statistic of X amount of

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,640
our users are this age we now can say

00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,970
Joyce wants this and where I want this

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,170
other examples might be

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,000
Joyce might want to hype the phone

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,320
number easily accessible so she can call

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,860
maybe she doesn't want to deal with an

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,050
online forum so we need to make sure

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,140
that phone number is easy to find she

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,490
also might want a larger font to read we

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,310
also based on Laura

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,990
it needs to be mobile friendly we

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,170
probably want to look that says more

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,550
high quality versus discount and she

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,960
might want to click the call button she

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,400
might not want to type the phone number

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,810
in her phone she might want to just hit

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,720
a button and place her order because

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,660
she's in a hurry so knowing this if we

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,950
hadn't had these we could design a

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,450
beautiful form like a beautiful online

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,810
ordering form with all these complicated

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,000
things and checkboxes and I mean good

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:46,510
out there and find that Joyce doesn't

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,310
use it at all and Laura is in too much

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,230
of a hurry to click a bunch of buttons

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,030
and scroll through pages and pages of

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,890
this complicated online ordering thing

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,080
so this is where the these user personas

00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:01,450
and knowing who is using and building at

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,780
the feet can really help all right next

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:08,440
item before you dive into your site is

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:10,300
sitemaps so sitemaps are a way to

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,100
organize the information and the

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,050
navigation of your website after

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,300
creating a sitemap you should have a

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:20,950
complete map of all the pages and

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:24,310
subpages on your site so how do you make

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,750
a sub site sitemap my favorite way super

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,810
simple bring it back to the basics

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,150
post-it notes one way to tackle your

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,940
sitemap is to start by writing down all

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,530
the names of all the pages you'll need

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,650
on post-it notes and stacking them in

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,600
rows under the home page of how you feel

00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,940
they should be organized and then the

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,290
next step this is the important step go

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,530
through write down everything that you

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,540
think go back and then edit them what

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:53,020
can you combine what can you eliminate

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,000
what's redundant and so you'll end up

00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,660
eventually with something like this

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,759
so this is for a landscape business and

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,459
we have our post-it notes and you can

00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,860
tell that they start on the homepage we

00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,509
have our main navigation so in the top

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,740
we're gonna have an about us and our

00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:13,610
service is a gallery and a contact us

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,339
then they're probably gonna have in the

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,639
format of a drop-down menu a mowing page

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:21,050
and a snow removal and the post-it notes

00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,550
and the pen and pencil are great because

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,310
you can really just move things around

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,230
you can shuffle them you can even add

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,610
links if you have a navigation in your

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,379
footer you can put some down at the

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:35,360
bottom so those are a great way to know

00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:40,600
before you start building your site know

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,829
what pages you have how many pages so

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,050
sitemaps are sometimes confused with

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,800
user flows or tasks flow so that's

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,589
something I want to talk about the

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,060
difference of user flows also known as

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:54,649
task flows both take the form of

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,269
flowcharts the difference is in what

00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,819
they represent so a site map is about

00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,500
your pages specifically and the

00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:03,439
structure of your navigation and your

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,379
content a user flow is how a user gets

00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:08,689
from point A to point B so I think the

00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:12,559
great analogy is from UX movement comm

00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:14,480
what they say is that they state that a

00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,699
site map is like looking at a map of a

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,009
territory from a bird's eye view with

00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:21,800
all major landmarks visible on the map

00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,389
and a user flow is like putting in

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,399
coordinates for directions on Google

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,410
Maps you can see which route to take

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,410
where to turn and the miles it takes to

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:34,610
get there so I know I mentioned user

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:36,670
flows let's talk about that briefly so

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,170
where user flows are really useful

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:43,040
they're useful for applications and

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:45,379
larger ecommerce sites and that's really

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,870
how we start thinking about going from

00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:50,089
page to page what is the process like

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,269
for our customer for our user using our

00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:55,879
site how many steps does it take someone

00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:58,370
to put an item in their cart or on board

00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,829
to create an account for example has

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,079
anyone ever played or watched zoom the

00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,699
TV show the kids show yeah have you ever

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,949
seen the clip of the peanut butter and

00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:09,500
jelly game or heard of the peanut butter

00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:10,940
and jelly game okay this is I

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,400
should I put a video in here so the

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:16,070
peanut-butter-and-jelly game is where

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,990
you instruct someone who you can't see

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,340
so you stand like this and you have

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,960
someone behind you making a peanut

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,450
butter and jelly sandwich and they have

00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,130
to kind of play dumb and follow exactly

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,660
to the letter at the steps you take to

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,310
make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,470
and maybe you didn't tell them to open

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,090
the bread bag or maybe you didn't tell

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,370
them to unscrew the jar of peanut butter

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,900
and they do literally what you say and

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,430
you end up with like a jar of peanut

00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,170
butter between two slices of bread or

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,360
something like that because they didn't

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,940
open the jar so that's kind of with a

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,180
user flow you're trying to think of all

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,130
of the decisions you're making and

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,510
trying to kind of like play that peanut

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,850
butter and jelly game where you want to

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,830
be very specific and next thing you know

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,050
you forgot that that user to put an item

00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,240
in their cart has to click through four

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,950
pages or something you find or put

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,720
something in or something that's a lot

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,850
more steps than you thought of we'll

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,420
just have them check out it'll be so

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,450
great

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:14,570
so thinking of exactly what your user is

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:17,570
doing so when do we need to use a user

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,310
flow so user flows are really handy on

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,280
sites that require its users to complete

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,480
a task in order to be successful

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,950
examples can be creating an account like

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,390
onboarding adding an event to a calendar

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,760
putting a product in a cart and checking

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,100
out filling out a form to download an

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,900
e-book your user flow should help you

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,550
see how long and straightforward the

00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,800
process is to completing the task you

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,750
want your users to take if the task is

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,460
too long complicated or confusing you

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,930
can lose your users on the journey

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,740
leaving the goal of your website

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,810
unfulfilled

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,520
if you've ever visit a website that is

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,710
so complicated to use that it has an

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,839
entire page dedicated to setting up your

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,520
account or checking out then you can

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,740
empathize with how frustrating that is

00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,300
and see how mapping out the process you

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,339
don't want to have instructions for how

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,720
people have to checkout you want them

00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:09,530
just to be able to do it so here's an

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,290
example of a user flow here for a

00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,700
checkout process and so as you can see

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,280
when drawing out all the steps of this

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,930
is a simple checkout process there's a

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,640
lot of steps that someone has to go

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,189
through for a simple basic checkout

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,929
process

00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:24,670
looking at this user flow we can tell

00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:27,009
that the longest path to checkout is

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,350
creating a new user account before

00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:31,660
checking out that's why having a guest

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,300
checkout option for users in a hurry is

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,369
a great option other options we could

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,429
consider to offer a shorter checkout

00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:41,619
process could be having social media

00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:44,589
sign-in this can make that process

00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:46,420
shorter having a one page checkout with

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:47,949
billing info billing address shipping

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,279
address and shipping info all on the

00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:53,319
same pages I've also seen check outs

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,329
with the step numbers on top so you know

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,119
you're on step one of three so they know

00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,559
what's coming up how long it takes so

00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:01,179
creating these user flows super

00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,189
important because it shows you barriers

00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:05,230
to your users completing the goal on

00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:06,850
your site after you create your user

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,619
flow you would want to go back to those

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,230
user personas so then we're gonna reel

00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:13,239
it back and go back to choice and I

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,790
believe Sara and we're gonna see

00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:17,970
wouldn't they be able to do this where

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:21,100
are they gonna stumble or have trouble

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,929
and what can we change to make it better

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,699
for those two personas so they can

00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:30,549
complete this easily and quickly and

00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:32,649
painlessly as possible all right and the

00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:36,720
last but not the least step I'm gonna

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:39,850
talk about is content guide documents

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,350
alright there are many forms of content

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,819
guide documents this is another one of

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,999
those you can find lots of samples

00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:47,769
online to pull off you can make your own

00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:48,910
if you're working with an agency if you

00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:50,799
own a small business and you're working

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,079
with an agency typically agencies will

00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,689
have their own content guide document

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:58,600
they want you to fill out in their own

00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,949
preferred format if you're building

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,230
sites for clients you really should

00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:04,990
create your own custom questionnaire for

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,869
them to get like the information that's

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,149
most important for you and your process

00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:11,769
a contact ID document contains all of

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,809
the copy that's going to be on your

00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,999
website this document can be as simple

00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:17,980
as a word document with a new page that

00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:20,529
corresponds to an item on your site map

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,629
and a super simple content guide

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:28,419
document will only contain your

00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:30,980
headlines in your text so why use a

00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:33,960
content guide document

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,780
so if you have a Content guide your

00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,210
designer will have an idea and designers

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,740
love content guide documents we very

00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,090
much appreciate this but they'll have an

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,700
idea of the size and type of your

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,710
content and then they can design your

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,170
site to meet your content needs and show

00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,120
it off rather than an empty container

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,070
that you have to fill so I think like if

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,410
you think of it like a clear vase if we

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,480
have your content we can build this

00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,420
perfect box or container for all of the

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,830
content but if you don't have the

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,240
content and you build and design the

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,579
whole website first you then have to

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,560
kind of smush your content in there and

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,000
maybe it doesn't look so great and that

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,439
container rebuild doesn't show it off

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,900
the way it should or say you have too

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,400
little content and we built this

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,860
beautiful website for four to five

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,089
paragraphs you then have this little sad

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:25,709
content rattling alone lonely there so

00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:27,480
this exercise should also give you an

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,220
idea of all the images and assets you'll

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,670
need to provide your designer and

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,160
developer and most importantly this step

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:38,220
is the step I've seen most hold up the

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,080
launch of a website getting content can

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,370
really delay the launch of your site and

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,230
you want to be able to launch that as

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,960
soon as possible

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,600
a site can't launch without content so

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,270
getting that together is a great first

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,620
step the earlier you figure out what

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,510
content you have and what you're gonna

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,570
put on there the sooner your site can

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,820
launch also now it's okay to tweak it a

00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,580
little bit it's okay to write something

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,470
it's not permanent and adjust it but

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,720
just knowing like well it's gonna be

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,010
about one paragraph maybe a sentence

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,930
here at two will change maybe the

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,430
wording will change it's okay it doesn't

00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,080
have to be set in stone it is the

00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,660
Internet that's a great part as we can

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,970
iterate but getting an idea for what's

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,970
gonna be on each page is so important

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,390
all right so this is a sample content

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,700
guide I made up here very very basic we

00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,400
have a page title what's going to be on

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,930
that page this is an about Us page we

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,960
have the content so this is for a

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,420
business so they um they're about Us

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,010
page so they have a little paragraph

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,730
about their business

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:47,700
they have who they are and their names

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,320
we have a call to action so they have

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,080
something they want you to get a quote

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,970
from them and then we just have a list

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,460
we don't even have the actual files just

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,559
a list of the file names that are gonna

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,360
go on this page and you can hand this to

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,760
your designer your developer and they're

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,360
gonna know okay I'm a designer I now

00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:11,250
know that we have one two three four

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,600
four images a small paragraph and a few

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,640
names and a call to action

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,900
I'm not going to design a huge page for

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,549
ten

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,590
paragraphs I'm gonna make sure that this

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:21,809
is shown off as we need it to and you

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,460
know it can still be flexible enough we

00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,530
can add another person we can take away

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,250
a person we have a basic idea of what's

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,250
going on here

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,030
okay so important question what if I'm

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,040
working with an agency so if you're a

00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,900
small business owner you're working with

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,100
an agency why do you need to know this

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,669
you're maybe sitting here and saying I'm

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,890
not a designer I'm not a developer I'm

00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:48,390
having my site built and redesigned what

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,190
good is this for me do I really need to

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,530
know this isn't this their job and I

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,440
think the answer is yes or no and no

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,910
it's kind of a combination a good web

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,400
designer and developer they're gonna do

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,600
all of this process with you they're

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,570
gonna walk you through at least several

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,059
of these steps and you can hire someone

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,429
to do all of this for you but there's

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,820
benefits huge benefits for giving it a

00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:13,110
first go around yourself first of all

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,169
when you're trying to get quotes you're

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,610
calling up agencies and you're trying to

00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,650
get an idea of how long your site will

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,419
take how much it'll cost you're gonna

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,860
have a much better idea the scope of

00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:28,860
your project when you know you can say I

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,080
have seven pages and this is what's

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,640
going on you're gonna be able to get a

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,620
much more accurate coat and maybe it'll

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,030
change maybe it'll be six maybe it'll be

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,710
eight with their recommendation they're

00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:39,240
the experts and they can recommend some

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,059
tweaks to your content but having that

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,190
starter part you can get a much more

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:48,059
accurate time quote a much more accurate

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:50,790
money quote also this is your site and

00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,440
your business so you are honestly going

00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,620
to have the most first-hand knowledge of

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,600
your customers in your audio

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,780
no one knows your customers better than

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,070
you do and well as a designer I can

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,050
research your customers and make

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,520
decisions based on the data you're

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,110
probably the one who's going to hear the

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,360
complaints when it doesn't work for them

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,890
and you're gonna get their phone calls

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,020
and concerns and if it's a

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,880
brick-and-mortar store you're gonna be

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,440
the ones you know their names you know

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,809
who's coming in so you're gonna have the

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,240
most personal knowledge of them so

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:21,790
you're gonna be able to influence what

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,980
as a designer I would be making up and

00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,660
say like I really know that this person

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,150
comes in every day and I want to make

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,760
sure this works for them

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,890
also having all this info allows your

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,990
agency or designer to spend time making

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,090
recommendations to refine your site and

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,240
use their expertise to make the site as

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,450
best as possible with refinements rather

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,860
than spending lots of time on legwork

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,010
there's a lot of time at an agency that

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,800
can be spent getting down content and

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:53,530
hunting it down and making edits and you

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,590
know maybe they make three or four

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,360
design comps and it's they didn't even

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,520
need that page so that's wasted money

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,140
that you can save time and money by

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,880
having more information about the

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,210
product before they make something that

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:13,230
we need to completely redo so they can

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:17,440
focus exactly on what you need all right

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:20,320
so I have I have not put my slides up

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,360
anywhere yet but I'm going to add them

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,100
my updated slides so you can download

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,330
and I will tweet that out if you're on

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,309
Twitter here's the link to resources but

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,720
also hope you want me to go back to do

00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:33,720
you want a picture of that page yeah

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,410
and I just realized I talked really

00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,330
really fast this same presentation took

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:54,180
40 minutes last time so feel free to ask

00:22:45,330 --> 00:23:03,810
a lot of questions does anyone have any

00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:06,660
questions yeah I honestly just use like

00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:08,340
Google draw I pen and paper is my

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:14,780
favorite I'm a big fan of pen and paper

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:20,790
I think with all the tools out there

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:22,320
both with wireframing driving clothes

00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,840
sitemaps the more you can keep it simple

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,700
in the beginning the better it is it

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,280
cost you know there's lots of fancy apps

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,780
which are great but make sure you keep

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,450
in mind I see this with my students a

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:35,280
lot the tools are supposed to speed up

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,840
your workflow not slow them down and if

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,480
it takes too much time to learn and slow

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,250
down your workflow it's not worth it so

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,640
that's why I say whiteboard pen and

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,320
paper stick to the basics first and then

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,790
if you find that maybe you're not a good

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,860
writer or you have to give something to

00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:52,110
a client then move into a program that

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,750
will make it a little faster but if it's

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:57,080
just for you go for the simple fast and

00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,080
cheap way

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,810
any other question

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,270
has anyone done any of these sites steps

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,950
before how have they as there been a

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,590
time when you haven't done one and it's

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,590
like it's not gone well for your project

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:32,050
or has gone really well and saved your

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:32,050
project yeah

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,229
yeah go for it

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,010
yeah I would say so my favorite way to

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,420
do it it's so this is hard if the

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,520
business already exists it makes it a

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,550
lot easier it is a lot harder for me

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,510
when the business doesn't exist but if

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,360
you're working with a brick and mortar

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:19,330
shop go in an interview that cost their

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,610
customers like you know if it's a give

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,770
away some free product to see if you can

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,910
just ask them some questions and talk to

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,670
who they're doing talk to their cashiers

00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:30,340
so the people that have regulars if they

00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:32,380
know you're regulars names that's a

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,030
great person to talk to who are their

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,340
regular like I worked at a cafe for

00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,870
years and we had one regular who we even

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,820
had a button for because he ordered the

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,190
same thing every day like you want to

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,510
know those people who are coming in you

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,400
want to talk to the people who are

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,290
interfacing with the customers as much

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,270
as possible talk to the people if it's

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:52,270
an online store who are getting the

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:54,100
complaints every day on the phone who's

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,710
calling in what is their biggest

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,480
complaint you know what get that idea

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,350
about them for online you have analytics

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,400
which is great and you can look at that

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:06,430
and that should give you a good snapshot

00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,350
but yeah and then from there I used like

00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,540
unsplash.com is just a free photography

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:17,020
site and there's some others just grab a

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:18,520
free photo and then if like saying you

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,580
don't have the opportunity you're just

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,230
using analytics see if you can find

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,940
someone who fits that demographic so you

00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,230
have an analytics and you get someone in

00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,670
that demographic see if you can find

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,940
someone who fits that demographic and

00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,590
talk to them what's their name like what

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,720
do they do where do they like to look

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:38,220
for other websites what kind of things

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,220
do they do they're in their free time

00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:52,270
