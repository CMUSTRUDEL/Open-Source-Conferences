Description: 
	What makes a database query fast or slow? Are WP_Query’s taxonomy queries fast? What about meta queries? In this talk, we’ll dig into the WordPress database schema, talk about what factors influence query performance, and learn how to sniff out potential performance problems before they ever give you a headache. Next, we’ll discuss strategies for refactoring queries to be as performant as possible, caching strategies, and more.
