Title: Jonathan Perlman: Level up on Building Forms
Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	A required feature of any website these days is a contact form. There are many free and premium plugins for WordPress that can be used to create simple contact forms, surveys and quizzes, user generated content, email marketing captures, or even complex conditional ecommerce checkouts.
We’ll go through the options in what form plugins will allow you to do to suite your needs. Also, we’ll look at some features that makes your forms easier to fill out than others.

welcome to ability forms of adrenaline

00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:11,030
Pearlman

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:33,350
I can find my slides by the way Act J

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:36,079
compliment on CA gonna be sorry so yes

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,670
I'm Canadian senior developer at Boston

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:44,809
College

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:47,559
Dustin colleges higher education Muslim

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:56,059
teacher college spoon ready to teach

00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:57,739
essentially WordPress of a teacher also

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:02,659
speaking word games with a runner on the

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:04,909
trail of Rochester Portland before so

00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,770
why do we need to create a forum

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:09,740
well there's a few things why we needs

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:13,430
creep works we need to apply for things

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,439
events 12,000 applications for nossek

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,079
college so that's all through very

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,640
complicated form people register for

00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,940
events well we've never met

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,400
College from campus registration for

00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,500
like you know something once a truck

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,440
very well that's an event people need to

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,780
register for that captured leads well

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,090
what happens is that nine credits

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,220
division they've got classes was not old

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,080
we're running so there are therefore

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,700
they want to capture interest any

00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,530
classes that are not running in

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,479
assignments consider it'll lead it so

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,759
that means they can capture the interest

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,210
in contacting them down the road me a

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,190
cloth is available generating content

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,039
uses what would happen to that with

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,770
certain departments we have our our

00:01:54,039 --> 00:02:00,140
graduates to submit content to the

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,479
department to reform and then from that

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,940
form from that submission we actually

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,890
can create pages of the grant for the

00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,840
graduate and say okay basically

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,470
highlighting what the graduates done

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,050
over time and yes actually even in

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,390
higher education we can sell things and

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:22,940
we can take in money for products where

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:25,280
we're selling somebody it's sort of like

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,220
YMCA memberships but not for selling

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,620
basically memberships to our campus

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:39,260
recreation so we're definitely taking

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:41,690
money for for services so that's this is

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,350
just a one example of a registration

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,850
where they're registering for event

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:50,019
taking their name their email address

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:53,030
phone number contacting back up

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,660
capturing leaves well here's our waiting

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,549
list form

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,220
portala Center for training development

00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:00,350
for basically for nine credits again

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,299
meaning email address phone number which

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,870
course are you interested in taking down

00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:07,820
the road and here is user-generated

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,130
content so what happens is that this

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,170
person Alex he submitted his own

00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,870
information gave us a couple of pictures

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,769
give us some youtube links and this page

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,900
that created based on that submission so

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:22,880
I have to generate forms there's a whole

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,380
slew of different tools out there and as

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,530
we going just we doesn't eighteenth or

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:34,010
nineteenth even more tools are coming on

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:37,190
the scene so the first tool will not but

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,930
yes jetpack action has a form creation

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,890
tool built engines I'm using we're

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,379
custom jetpack is the features of work

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,940
not by palm on the southwest of websites

00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,160
so that means you could be using Joe

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,190
Cocker and then you have a very simple

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:56,680
contact form so then there is one option

00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:01,890
for you if you want to be a bit more

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:04,260
advanced a bit more customizable

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,660
seven but here's the thing they don't

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,640
recommend it only because of the fact

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,980
that nowadays everything's ready drop

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,260
point and collect contact form seven

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,720
isn't drag and drop it's Rico debased

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,500
it's very code it's very HTML and code

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,440
list so at that point it's not exactly

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,419
useful for the faint of heart

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,060
there are mainly two or three form

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,550
plugins that I do recommend in terms of

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,950
drag and drop ability ninja for this is

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,070
one that's one of the one of the longer

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,660
more established form companies that has

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,810
been doing portents they would a very

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,150
drag-and-drop interface do you talk

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,760
about feel to the moments but basically

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,770
you take the Latino you try and drop is

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,310
saying there's your form thank you very

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,930
much with through the field itself you

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,669
just click the field click the main

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,370
field and you've got a whole slew

00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,040
buttons on most low-tech of options that

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,490
you can customize on the name field per

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,580
se now the thing with ninja forms is

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,770
that it's got its base plugin is free

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,280
you're gonna find ninja forms in the

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,940
wordpress.org plug-in directory no

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,770
problem

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,370
you've got a lot of good functionality

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,200
for free okay but the thing is at that

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,960
point when you want to get into more

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,890
complicated things that's where they're

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,710
gonna want some money

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,960
that's weird enough to buy an add-on and

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,810
is essentially extra

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,930
for ninja forms but you're not going to

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,979
get a free debate for these add-ons at

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:39,199
which at that point with ninja clumps as

00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:41,660
with all their add-ons and is gonna get

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,880
expensive down the road if you need a

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,259
lot of different add-ons it might be

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,650
better off to go into different plugins

00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:52,310
solution so the most low that ones these

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,020
are just about nine of them referring to

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,570
most things as an example front-end

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,990
posting is basically the creation of the

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,150
public pages multi-part forms multi-part

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,080
forms we're going to talk about it so it

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,550
basically moved the age forms if you

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,970
want to take the money with the forms

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,130
strength PayPal you gotta pay money for

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,470
that file upload some people to

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,139
uploading files to you you gotta pay for

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,539
that so they're basically nickel and

00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:23,479
diming you it's not back there because

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:25,400
if you only need to take in name phone

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,280
number credit card number

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,940
Stryker PayPal and the story you're done

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,210
so ultimately when plugin might suffice

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,280
her need but if you need to do multi

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,620
page plus conditional logic plus

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,669
thinking and money plus formats in the

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,900
front end posting it might get extended

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:49,039
so it depends on what you need to do

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:51,800
with your forms now another big player

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,949
in the forms market is probably for my

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,110
graduate forms is it's a it's a bigger

00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,039
plugin to begin with your know how to

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:03,289
find it in the plug-in repository

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:06,510
because it's an 18 and plug-in now be

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:09,560
plugging better yes and no again

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:12,360
you need to do because ninja for

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,580
grounded ones our performance gives you

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,470
the same kind of functionality drag and

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,190
drop you create all the performance and

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:24,000
others fields very very intuitive what

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:27,210
in click interface the lowest a company

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,120
moving in four years what happens and

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:34,260
then you definitely need it's a low cost

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,020
of entry with premium features so what

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,640
happens is that you paid I don't

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,490
remember the pricing these days but last

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,380
I checked it was less than 100 bucks

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,010
and you're getting a lot of complicated

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,110
features for one price it is definitely

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,350
very useful if you're gonna do multiple

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,150
multiple forms on top of that it's gonna

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:59,100
be very useful if you have a very

00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:01,200
complicated process with your form it's

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,490
a very large user base then on top of

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,190
that they've been extensive

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,510
documentation if your developer in the

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,230
room what happens is that there's also

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,390
very extensive hook and filter features

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:15,690
so you can do a lot of different things

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:19,770
you can push the bowl with all that data

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,450
internally now because of time I'm going

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,430
to focus on grabbing forms just because

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,640
I can't focus on the thin features in

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,200
three different for plugins so in terms

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,430
of what we're going to talk about right

00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:34,290
now we're talking based on gravity force

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,690
so field options what kind of field

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,669
options

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,729
you're looking these functions mean to

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,949
you so the thing is you've got single

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,589
line text fields single line text fields

00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:49,370
are basically your de facto standard in

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:54,379
fields a name field a phone number field

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:57,240
email address field signal one text

00:08:54,379 --> 00:09:00,779
paragraph text though is if you want to

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,620
take in a block of text user comments a

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,199
message

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,879
you know multi paragraphs that's

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:09,209
essentially what the paragraph text

00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,639
field would be dropdowns so you've got

00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:14,009
multiple options and the person has to

00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,860
click into it and it drops down well

00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:18,750
that's your drop down field gravity

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,939
forms that gives you a number field and

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,129
then that number field what happens that

00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:25,350
it allows you to only enter numbers

00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:28,350
let's say you're requesting an age from

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,449
a person well that age is not going to

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,519
be characters it's not three letters so

00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:34,379
at that point the number field walks

00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,269
down so they can only type in numbers

00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:41,480
into that box checkboxes and multiple

00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:43,620
choice are similarity and difference

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,500
essentially it's checkboxes or radio

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,149
buttons it's just it's similar to

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,689
dropdowns where it gives the user a

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:55,350
selection options but either it's

00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:55,709
checked one of many or check all that

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,589
apply

00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:01,580
so let's say for example you're doing

00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:04,100
artist VB form for a wedding

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,769
is she one person a person check do you

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,610
like chicken fish or beef one over the

00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:13,100
three not all that's essentially a radio

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,140
button or multiple choice where they can

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,700
which is one but then if you want

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,019
something whereby something is going to

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,360
give you their opinion on different

00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:21,440
categories we wanted to apply too many

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,570
options

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,180
that's checkboxes hidden fields are very

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:32,480
powerful did you feel the basically

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,000
feels on the form which you technically

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,910
can't see they are in there but they're

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,950
not visible to the normal person they

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,890
you can get to them from code you can

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,029
get to look from different ways but it's

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:49,040
generally a feel that you're not

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:50,779
supposed to see in East River Fields is

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,450
actually not really field as basically

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:56,420
us having the ability to put into

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,250
whatever HTML we wanted it's not formed

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:04,269
basically we can put in a whole block of

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,269
stylized text block of really anything

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:14,190
yeah these low section page break

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:17,010
features give you more functionality

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,610
where we can then section off your fuel

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:24,420
to put your fields here your Foreman

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,190
fields into logical groupings so you're

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,050
basically asking people to put in would

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,300
say all this stuff about themselves and

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,740
then at that point in it over the

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,470
section they can put a table it's saying

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,300
their credit card information so that's

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,120
two different sections I couldn't be two

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,890
different sections and paint breaks

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,270
works similarly where you can

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,820
essentially make the move a different

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,830
age to fill in the rest of the form

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:51,150
which I'm going to talk about in a few

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:53,820
minutes with the gravity forms similarly

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,070
like a ninja forms you've got extra

00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,350
advanced fields so what they do is they

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:02,460
kind of make it a lot easier to fill in

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,590
those this complicated feels like need

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,290
where my name could really be first

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:09,690
thing lasting could be the prefix to the

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,850
suffix we could turn those on turn those

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:16,770
off so instead of being adding five

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:20,400
boxes for the name well adding one field

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,650
in there you go big time is a specific

00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,160
field that's what we use so that people

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,620
have the ability to use a date picker

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,950
they pick a date from a calendar and

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,519
then you

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,019
format that she wants phone number and

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,269
actor or phone number is basically

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:39,820
filled in gravity forms that allows you

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,560
the bonus show in the North American

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,329
standard phone number where it will

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,310
automatically put in brackets and put in

00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:50,649
the dash and people just type their

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,959
numbers there is also the the address

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,510
field on the actress field basically

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,550
allows you the ability to put in a North

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,970
American Standard address into all the

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,889
fields needed for that so you don't have

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,649
to put any five or six different fields

00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:07,350
in here is just one shot here's your

00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,820
address thank you very much what we love

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,120
sometimes near the United States and I

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,410
know community I'm spoiled but it will

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,130
be United States would be at the very

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,620
end

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:21,130
got the drop box is there a way to have

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:24,760
the functionality okay what happens is a

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:28,990
the question basically was in the US was

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:32,529
the in the US because of the fact that

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:35,079
the United States is essentially within

00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:36,970
you you know if you sorted

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,140
alphabetically in exist at the bottom is

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,089
their functional area that you can move

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,220
it all the way to top actually yes you

00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:44,170
can you can definitely give you a preset

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,199
list and you can then change the preset

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,209
list path of the faculty same thing for

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,610
Canada for directors I always have to

00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:56,440
exceed like two or three times stanza

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:58,740
from Cambodia so yeah it would be it is

00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,740
a good thing

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:06,370
by that list website molesting likes at

00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,650
that point less people detected

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,540
biographies so it'll do a little bit of

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:14,200
detection of them on the forum every web

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,660
address even though it's a signal

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,089
basically for validation purposes in

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,370
front of check to see if the email is in

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,740
the right format it won't check to see

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,330
in people existence there just check to

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,520
see that sudden if - that all the bells

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:31,660
and whistles like the @ sign and the

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,820
period file uploads this is a very

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,700
complicated field file upload which a

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,990
lot of potential security ramifications

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,940
so what happens is that with the 500

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,660
field there are actually upload

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,550
documents to your server to your sites

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:50,560
and that is built-in and by the waiting

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:52,870
them to gravity force on to that and

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,200
then capture is another kind of field

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,060
that you can be involved with Google

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,930
reCAPTCHA which essentially is an

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:04,930
alternative love was one spam blocking

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:07,839
so spam blocking is essentially required

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,130
because if you weren't into the security

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,260
talks in the morning

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,830
spam can get into your inter form

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:17,080
basically blots out their random scripts

00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,839
out there are just basically hammer any

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,730
forms and trying to submit information

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,620
this is all automated questions yeah

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,260
you've got a lot of information you can

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,850
collect

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:33,750
yes a lot of these builders have add-ons

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:35,670
or features that allow you to basically

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,920
manage manage your leads our band

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,900
manager database good question I'm going

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,490
to talk about that after the question

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,780
was with all the form builders add-ons

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,970
is starting leave management

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,990
capabilities absolutely talking about

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,930
that later so I am in terms of

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,060
collecting the data helping the person

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,940
interpret the information this is

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,820
actually a screenshot of forms whereby

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,190
that sections so it may not be

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,350
completely readable in the back I do

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,950
apologize for that but basically it

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,720
gives you titles for a category for a

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,850
whole set of fields that would be

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,600
considered a section and then you can

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,190
put in stuff you put the fields into

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,590
groupings so the first group is the

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,060
about you group and in the event you

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,250
group you're giving the name you're

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,020
doing the email address and then at that

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,860
point after the next section is what's

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,180
on your mind

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,280
and then what's on your mind is

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,510
essentially two fields where you can put

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,430
it with the user can put in a whole

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:36,440
paragraph of what's on their mind

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:41,959
here's that reCAPTCHA which I was

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,470
talking about before the data goes into

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,360
the database

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,540
it goes into the WordPress database and

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:52,399
at that point we can then manage those

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:54,920
entries after the fact so in terms of

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,839
layout what happens is that you can

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,269
actually control the layout to a certain

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,190
degree there are tools in there in those

00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,850
features in gravity forms and ninja

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:09,020
forms to help you create multiple clones

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:11,120
fields cutting the columns in multiple

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,250
sometimes having columns and multiple

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,199
field that I mean but fields sorry

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,730
sometimes of having fields in multiple

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,220
columns is actually better for the user

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,589
but be careful because of that point

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,720
sometimes it's not so those people are

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,910
going to get a confuse of jumping from

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,309
left to right left right sometimes

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,950
having to pull one column gown that's

00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:35,740
better off so it depends again on the

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,740
form that is being put towards the users

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,799
conditional love this is a very very

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,260
useful tool for form builders what

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,880
happens is that conditional logic

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,340
essentially any driving forms yes to be

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,650
applied to appeal the section and submit

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:57,190
button so essentially here's the thing

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,190
so with the form imagine you're saying

00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:05,480
the next one basically you're saying

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:07,740
that Dawson we have the situation

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,600
welcome back from that a lot of our

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,460
students are coming from high school

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,050
most of our students are coming from

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,150
high school they're not coming

00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,310
internationally now I realize other

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,260
scenarios of the schools they really

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,750
will have those internationals we don't

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,420
we don't need them then it just adds

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,400
working and the process to us that we

00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,260
kind of don't want therefore we have a

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,060
form of a very open forum where

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,160
basically everybody can ask a question

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:37,290
and we ask are they that are you an

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,880
international students right off the bat

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,430
if you're an international student

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,910
there's conditional logic in place that

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,770
says okay here's some tax have you tried

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,930
going to our international students page

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,820
for all of dimension to all the

00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,070
questions that are going to have all

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,620
those answers are over there so section

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:58,740
of the forum once it shuts down but it

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,630
gives them helpful tips and hints based

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,990
on the factors that are international if

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,630
they put any other choice they will see

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,520
the whole thing about international so

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,180
essentially if you've seen on forums

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,980
before if you apply to this category

00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,560
then you fill in this field it's

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,240
something like that or by now which

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,290
gravity forms and into forms and

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,040
conditional logic you can then test how

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,890
do you apply

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,590
yes or no if you've applied then you

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,300
show them a whole series of fields if

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,550
they haven't applied well that point

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,300
they'll need to see it feels so

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:39,380
sometimes less fields are more because

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,380
at that point you're not showing

00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:46,239
and another jinda another way to do

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,409
conditional logic is essentially if

00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:52,090
you're doing multi camera big sales team

00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:55,210
ability team or department in verse 14

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,919
you can then tailor the floor so that if

00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,859
they're contracting sales well it's

00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,999
essentially subject and message but if

00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,489
they're trying to contact customer

00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,769
service while at that point have you

00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:08,019
submitted trouble ticket yes or no if

00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:10,539
you have then the trouble ticket number

00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:13,599
field comes up and then you can submit a

00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,710
subject a message so all that is

00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,320
essentially conditional logic

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,509
conditionally showing fields conditions

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,389
showing sections conditionally showing

00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:24,460
pages with all feasible and for the

00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,349
record on top of that conditionally the

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,419
final submit button so if they haven't

00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:32,889
filled out all the fields you can then

00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:35,589
hide that submit button now multi page

00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:38,830
forties is another way to help the user

00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:40,419
actually because what happens with multi

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,009
page fields they're going to go through

00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:43,749
a process and they're going to go

00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:46,330
through let's say a four-step process of

00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:48,969
money and my demo whereby they're

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:52,659
showing we're showing them information

00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:57,999
to enter of themselves they hit next

00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:59,649
then their address they hit next or they

00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:04,929
can go previous they can go back and

00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:07,029
change information entered before then

00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:10,359
they hit next again after entering their

00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,330
honors they enter now what is their

00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,610
message

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,650
I said the to the support department for

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,290
sales departments what this basically

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:22,100
does for you it is that it gives you

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:24,200
gives the user less to focus on in one

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,780
at one time it does the overwhelming

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,850
user so what happens is that will keep

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,160
its Forks it actually makes the process

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,930
easier to fill out because they can then

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,400
focus on the fields that are showing you

00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:39,290
and then move on to the next and then of

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,240
course at the end if you want you can

00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,340
have a Terms of Service and they can

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,170
agree to the Terms of Service and

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,390
nowadays on top of that you have to be

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,760
asking for privacy information we've

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:53,080
asked them if they consent to giving us

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,910
our email address if you tell them that

00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:00,350
there's a whole thing with GPR with

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:04,130
whereby it's an entire wall on monitors

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:08,150
for marketing purposes so this entire

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,220
form you saw for ages but it could have

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:15,140
been a very very important gauge to the

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,580
level great daunting for the user in

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,590
terms of restricting access you can

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,720
actually restrict access we think I

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,490
already forms to your forms and what you

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,500
want to restrict access because it

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,170
ultimately you want as many people as

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,340
you want

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:31,080
forms wait a second not really because

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,570
forms like a registration form forward

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,080
camp there's only so many spots out of

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:40,110
work camp there's only so many spots at

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,560
magnetism so yes you can disable the

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,880
form based on the number of submissions

00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,130
and also on top of that you can disable

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,600
the form based on the date and time why

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:52,110
would something you I don't want to

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,090
register for camp tomorrow a little bit

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:57,150
a little bit out of the question because

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,800
we're canvas today tomorrow so you want

00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,630
to shut down the forum during one of

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,880
these situations where a learner shuts

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,040
out in the forum at a specific time

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,310
because life is over and the floor was

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,930
no longer required now for the

00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,930
developers in the room there is also a

00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,880
hook the hole so it helps in gravity

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:17,730
forms where you can interact with their

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,230
data and send data to third parties we

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:24,150
know almost Lou of different things with

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:27,660
the club's books and filters now after

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,130
cements okay after after somebody that's

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,310
a minute what do they see will them

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:35,040
again what happens well ultimately they

00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,840
should see something on their screen it

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,900
should see some text thank you for your

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,520
submission of the form ultimately it

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,130
would be also a good thing that you

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,920
email the information to them to say

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,070
thank you also by email that you receive

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,380
the form and

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,420
to them in a certain timeframe or this

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,410
is the next step to that process you

00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,610
phone them and so on and so forth

00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,710
speaking so this is confirmations that

00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,630
you mean ground before to be where it's

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:06,260
essentially one screen right after

00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:09,590
solution and notifications are basically

00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,210
emails to the person and also on top of

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,190
that to the administrator so this is the

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,230
email that the administrator would get

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,150
the person manage in the form they get

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:21,170
all the details no problem

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:24,890
like the real person filling out the

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:28,970
form you can get a very very pleased

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:31,010
simple for email saying in this case

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,450
thank you for submission and we look

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,340
forward to see you in a certain date and

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,940
time don't forget to bring this don't

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:42,200
forget screen backs so so sending emails

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:45,200
from forms is a good a good measure of

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,410
before because then you're then reading

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,590
the earth you're reinforcing that

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,290
relationship between you and the clients

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:57,380
are you in the person Thunder perform

00:24:53,290 --> 00:25:01,730
now talk a little bit about email

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:04,280
sending the forms there's when you're

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,650
sending email performance using the

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,630
basic WordPress email features which has

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,270
been at that point relying on the host

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,430
sending your email so there's been a lot

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,190
of situations where by and I've heard

00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,350
this that emails double out this is not

00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,950
the problem of warmest elements from

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,450
WordPress it's at the hosting level so

00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,690
if you're not sending emails are because

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,029
of these

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,549
it's not it's what gravity for me it's

00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:32,759
not WordPress will general it's um it's

00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:35,549
generally not the technology it's north

00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:39,210
of us level because of the nature of how

00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:41,399
hosts are set up and generated what'll

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,999
happen to say one psychic complicates

00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:47,099
compromise share hosts ultimately

00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,019
they're all get compromised so one

00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:52,049
seconds compromised there's an IP

00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,609
address that gets blacklisted if your

00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:54,929
sign is on that server with that IP

00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:57,989
address you're going to get blocked

00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,399
blocks into so as another way to send

00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,769
email what you could do is that their

00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:04,049
services those plugins up there that you

00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:06,570
can use with your forum with your

00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:08,339
WordPress install to ensure that email

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,919
goes out through a third part of the

00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:14,519
service another service is going to send

00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:17,039
a lady not your WordPress website not

00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:21,929
your web host so you might want to look

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:24,330
into that if you're relying on those now

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,219
in terms of database management what

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,560
happens is that there's a whole smooth

00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:31,960
database so when the fork goes

00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,360
get center then that point you can log

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,630
into WordPress back-end and you can see

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:41,110
a whole list of entries in your objects

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,900
or ninjaboys button so you don't see the

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:46,390
entries you can definitely resubmit

00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,270
those notifications you can read email

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:52,210
yourself reading those people not a

00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:54,760
problem ultimately delete those if trees

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:57,520
down the road and of course you can

00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,400
export those entries from gravity forms

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,680
into a CSV which have that point you can

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,870
even you can then import that into Excel

00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,950
or is it important that into any other

00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:17,950
system that you want so the sensor data

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:19,540
management questions almost okay we will

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,580
have time for questions I'll answer your

00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,630
question to have to go back so with

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,530
better performance there's also

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:28,420
resources the whole slew resources and

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,370
you've got documentation from the line

00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,040
about all the books all the features

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,650
getting started definitely there's

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:40,160
almost

00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:42,470
there there's also another what the

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,640
grout look but the gravity performance

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,770
company has done is that they've not let

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,820
sorry they've allowed their people to do

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,340
side things

00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:55,400
so this company this rocket on gravity

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,890
was is actually by the company that does

00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,020
gravity force so one develop are from

00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,880
gravity forms is behind this the sites

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:04,910
which means it's completely reliable

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,790
completely legit and I've found the best

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:14,390
information that I can like to find off

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:17,420
this better than I find this is

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,490
information that I find good they're

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,830
gonna hook reference I here developer

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,200
you want to know at what point when

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,750
those hooks fire off this is a really

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,280
good tool to use to see and what point

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:32,660
when those folks and filters are firing

00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,070
so at this point we definitely have time

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,110
for questions we're going to ten-minute

00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:38,870
a good nine minutes for questions I do

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:41,770
want on the floor so in terms of ask

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,770
each other questions

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:57,010
we're way too you know like looking so

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,130
well here's the thing so in terms of

00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,410
emailing a four month working thing so

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,570
as we see here there is some a way to

00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:07,059
export the data from one so that you as

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,309
a person controlling the form you're

00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:11,200
gonna see a list of entries in the

00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:14,130
prospective logged into your WordPress

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,480
back-end that a forms button on the lab

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,610
then in goes in the forms when you've

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,730
got entries in the entries are going to

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:25,179
see a whole list of your entries of all

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:28,080
the form submissions and then on top of

00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:31,840
that you can export all that data to CSV

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,860
it's essentially at that point it's a

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,900
manual thing now what you can also do is

00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,179
with all these notifications this is

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,280
actually going to dream up so by default

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:45,610
it emails the administrator on the site

00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,890
and this is your default email to the

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,340
administrator after every single form

00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,340
submission

00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,990
it's definitely not all fields going

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,460
into an email and this by the way is

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,140
default this actually you don't run

00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:14,370
through to set up it's already better

00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:16,049
women before that's community yeah okay

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,690
hidden fields basically allowing the

00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:21,020
ability to pull data from other systems

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:24,960
what happens is that um pulling data

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:26,789
will be different information system so

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,070
what will happen is I might create a

00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:33,030
hidden field on the form in fact here

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:35,280
exciting service make new masters so I'm

00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,320
basically using hidden fields to pull

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,480
data from WordPress port somewhere else

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,390
for that matter I'm putting that data

00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,620
that that in this gets this text I'm

00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,740
putting things where didn't field and

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,840
then at that point it goes to the

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,580
Buddhism to the field which means it

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,390
goes to perform submission which means

00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,640
the administrator sees this person

00:30:53,390 --> 00:31:00,480
registered for that event so I've got

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,730
one form for the magnets but I could

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,000
have many events that the supporting

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:08,520
applies to so instead of stuff I have 20

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,530
events I don't need to create 20 forms

00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,230
for registration they can create one

00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,970
thank you very much so the point is

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:18,389
basically grabbing the data of the page

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:21,309
it's on and knowing what a design means

00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:22,870
Bendis and then dumps that into the port

00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:25,539
before the administrator gets that

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:28,350
information so I until I create one for

00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:28,350
for 20 minutes

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,490
we're plugging that I recommend to the

00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:48,090
emails I don't only because I've got my

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:55,350
hosting is control dosing I don't post

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:58,710
with cirrhosis so I had a great but in

00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:01,590
terms of third-party solutions semi grid

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:04,110
is one of them mailgun is another one

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:16,770
that I know of so stay tuned reader male

00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:18,840
sacred or male but on top of that what

00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,880
you do is that instead of using testing

00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,370
plugins which just needs one more plug

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,679
in to worry about the record you can

00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,539
actually talk to submission yourself

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,640
you'll know whether the emails are

00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:32,270
coming out or not you can send them you

00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,270
know to yourself

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:44,749
okay oh it's not a question it's just a

00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,940
statement sometimes with gravity forms

00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:49,039
like at this problem a lot and sometimes

00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,320
just sending it to like a gmail account

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:56,179
let's say that the same address as your

00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:58,970
website probably was basically the fact

00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:02,419
that sometimes sending it to your

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,940
website address so so info at something

00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:05,720
it might be but it might be actually

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,999
well received

00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,669
if you maybe actually there is a feature

00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:13,369
or taking VCC into the ground for

00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:15,289
materials VCC those emails and you can

00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:17,570
send that off to the gmail address and

00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,580
you can set for Gmail and send her off

00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,499
the Gmail it's got different rules on

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,570
those emails that they receive and

00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:26,299
ultimately different stamp filtering is

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,740
applied so that kind of that's actually

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:30,169
not a bad idea to send it off to another

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,419
address as a fallback but that's a third

00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:34,369
level fallback remember you have our

00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:37,279
system the WordPress back-end which has

00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:40,220
access to all the entries in the list we

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,710
will never respond never lose ultimately

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,909
that data because WordPress is open

00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,909
source and even control

00:33:50,460 --> 00:34:01,499
all right gravity point is ground form

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,320
successful as a very good question in

00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:06,360
this between 18 gravity points as

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,429
accessible and we're working on making

00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,500
it even more accessible

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:14,040
there is another plugin that you can

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:17,339
install to make it gravity forms to form

00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,409
in five minutes to make it to WK 2.0 of

00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:21,720
accessible because what happens is that

00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:24,990
by default it doesn't do a few things

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,359
that is required by 2.0 so there is

00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:36,000
actually a plugin right there in the

00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:38,849
directory ministry just gravity forms to

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,040
anything for GBP are this very focus do

00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:44,179
anything for GDR at this point in time

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,819
today they have actually a blog post

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:50,609
highlighting their new version 2.4 and

00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:54,030
they do have ruled that Nouveau features

00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:56,849
in the upper room for that is addressing

00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,940
GPR in terms of a consent field in terms

00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:02,660
of data protection and also whether you

00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,660
do store

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,770
that's a very good question related GPU

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:14,520
GPR because you're going to be concerned

00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:16,860
about how long we started hearing form

00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,150
in factored forms of the whole holy

00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,150
stove not a winter store

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,189
