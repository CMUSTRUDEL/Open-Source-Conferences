00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:15,259
try not to fall asleep on me please I

will call you out if that happens my

00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:20,360
name is Terra and I'm here to provide as

00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,160
much value and as many takeaway as

00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,670
possible thank you so much for joining

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,020
me

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,270
and I will need to see what your

00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,150
knitting after this I get super pumped

00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,550
for knitters um my name is Terra and I

00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,430
own alchemy 3 a web design and marketing

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,769
agency in Concord Massachusetts we work

00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,620
with small businesses to amplify brand

00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:42,140
awareness boost online visibility and

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,820
increase engagement so in other words we

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,989
serve as a sort of virtual marketing

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,850
department for a number of our clients

00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:52,190
so to kick this thing off how many

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,050
people in the room are parents quick

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,179
show of hands or are you aware of the

00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:01,010
existence of children do you understand

00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:03,800
right okay you're you're aware of

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,990
children okay so what I've come to

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,969
realize that that there is not a lot of

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,869
differences between clients and kids

00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:12,590
right the main differences are usually

00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:16,009
clients have slightly better in

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,290
vocabulary they do have hopefully a

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,329
longer attention span and their shoes

00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,299
are normally tied unlike this guy on the

00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:25,820
left who is my Henry he is 8 on the

00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,799
right is my Mackay and we also have six

00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,380
chickens that get aggressively snuggled

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,510
every single day

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,760
those are the main differences that I

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,890
have noticed and one thing that I've

00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,500
come to realize is that when it comes to

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,710
dealing with clients a lot of it has to

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,840
do with managing expectations keeping

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,240
them focused and helping them to

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,430
understand that they're special we all

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,190
want to know that we're special someone

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:55,970
is paying attention to us and that we

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:58,010
are in fact acknowledged right so you've

00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,950
been hired to provide some direction and

00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:04,070
someone's of order by your clients they

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,350
seek comfort in that order and knowing

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,200
that information and support is in fact

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,660
available they don't necessarily want to

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,220
consume that information but making it

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:18,440
available is important so before I jump

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,750
into managing clients and of course

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,310
blowing them away with our awesomeness

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,920
and our ability to create these

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,900
masterpieces on the web at first light

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,800
like to talk about putting a system in

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,980
place for qualifying your leaves now

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,680
what is a lead qualifier a lead

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,890
qualifier is basically a boundary or a

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,380
series of boundaries or hoops that I am

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,209
insisting that a pot the prospect jump

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,800
through which allows me to determine

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:49,310
whether or not they are a viable

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,410
prospect so this gives me a chance to

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,920
make sure or to see if they're willing

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:57,110
to follow my process I can address the

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,280
budget straight away so you'll notice

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:03,380
here this is actually a snapshot of our

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,690
lead qualifying worksheet so if someone

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,150
pings us and they're interested in say

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:12,020
of web bills this is a five page form I

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,630
want to make sure that they're willing

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,040
to put in the extra time this also helps

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,830
to get the wheels turning a little bit

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,290
and it helps me to bring in some initial

00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:24,410
information and at the bottom which is

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,260
the most important part I have a budget

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,209
range so there's a drop-down so

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,230
immediately they know that we will not

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:36,320
build a site for less than $5,000 this

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,489
frees up more of your time and of course

00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,790
hopefully you're positioning yourself

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,450
already in a way that your potential

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,830
customers

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,290
are aware of the services that you

00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,330
provide and the kind of service that you

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,860
bring to the table they already know a

00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,690
little bit about your business and range

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,040
of expertise but that isn't a perfect

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,849
world and it doesn't always work that

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,069
way so when a cold lead reaches out

00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,620
wanting more information they want to

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:03,140
schedule a call I will send them to this

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,970
worksheet it doesn't necessarily need to

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,580
be fancy this was built with gravity

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,720
forums very easy to set up but you could

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:15,110
also send them a PDF a Word document

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,120
whatever that looks like is fine I do

00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,000
want to give credit where credit is due

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,930
this is not my idea this came from Troy

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,090
Dean of WP elevation he as a mentor of

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,270
mine and I've been in his program for

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,100
almost two years now highly recommend it

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:36,200
if you want to hear more talk to me

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:39,889
after the talk so let's say that you

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,660
have received a LEED qualifying form you

00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:45,410
have set up a 15-minute quick

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,150
conversation with said client and now

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:51,950
you need to sit down with your team or

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,560
yourself and put together a quick and

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,440
dirty client scorecard this is a five

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,090
minute exercise and what we do is we

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:05,780
rank budget project and levels of

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,950
respect on a scale of one to five so

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,680
based on

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,580
I mean budget is obviously

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,520
self-explanatory right if they have

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:19,190
loads of cash all aces we're good to go

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:21,380
um project by that I mean is it

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,940
interesting is it gonna look good on

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,669
your portfolio will you be learning new

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,440
skills is it gonna open doors are they

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,389
well connected right could this

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,039
potentially lead to other work so that's

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:34,250
those other kinds of things to consider

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,099
for me the most important one is

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,620
probably respect I want to make sure

00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:42,229
that they are not talking down to myself

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,940
or my team that they're not bulldozing

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:47,120
me in the conversation and that there is

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,909
a mutual respect so we also have that on

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,180
our earth score Carter as well so once

00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:54,300
we've we've ranked everything on a scale

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,240
of one to five

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,270
we will total all of those things up

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:05,300
three to six is a solid note 7-eleven is

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,300
a maybe 12 to 15 is a pretty solid yes

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:14,069
so things are looking good right they

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,479
were on a 12 plus scale you're excited

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,690
about the project so now it's time to

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:21,360
put the pitch together so before I jump

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,220
into communicating and managing your

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,229
clients I'd like to talk about making

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,009
that pitch getting the business and

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,419
gaining your clients trust so first of

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,190
all you want to make sure that all of

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,590
the decision-makers are in the room

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,569
right and that's actually one of the

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,990
questions that I ask on my lead

00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,789
qualified form I've had meetings in the

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,440
past where I'm aware that there are two

00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,150
different decision-makers I go to the

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,889
meeting there's only one I'm going to

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,440
reschedule because that is a waste of my

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,000
time it's a waste of everybody's time to

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,479
be honest and it's important for them to

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,069
understand that I have other things I

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,500
could be doing and I have other clients

00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,659
that I can be talking to right so very

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,460
kindly I'm happy to reschedule this

00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:05,400
meeting I would really like everyone to

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,159
be there you want to appeal to the

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,090
emotional brain so it's important that

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:14,849
when you go into these meetings you

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,680
become a friend first right they want to

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:19,289
make sure that they can trust you you're

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,960
a likable human and you're not a robot

00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,550
coming in and talking about your

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,199
services right you want to warm them up

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,469
you want to be a kind person make some

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,349
eye contact make a little small talk our

00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:33,199
brains do hate salespeople so please

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:35,400
don't talk about yourself the whole time

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,129
you want to speak to their specific

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,129
industry and niche as much as you can so

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,870
our brains have a frightening Lee short

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,550
attention span and that's getting

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:52,919
shorter by the day so once you warm them

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,240
up a little bit get to the point right

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,889
you've established some small talk

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,699
hopefully they've decided you're likable

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:01,500
human now get to the nitty-gritty and

00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:03,960
the best way to resonate with a client

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,750
is to gear your information toward what

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,680
is in it for them right you need to

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,340
appeal to their

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,990
brain by first connecting the dots

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,020
appealing to their needs goals concerns

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,639
and opportunities you want to make sure

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,289
that you are helping them solve the

00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,570
problem they don't need to understand

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,960
the nitty-gritty of said problem they

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,669
don't need to know about the plugins and

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,690
web security or any of that kind of

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,229
stuff they just want to make sure that

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,490
you're gonna do what needs to be done

00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:35,250
once you've gotten the emotional brains

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,870
attention and you've made it clear that

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,300
you're helping them solve a problem or

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,149
pain point you are more likely to have

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,440
their full attention and again you want

00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,050
to make sure that you are speaking the

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,279
language of your clients industry again

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,080
make sure you do your homework before

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:56,580
you go into these meetings and that you

00:08:49,080 --> 00:09:01,230
can speak to speak to their world so you

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,670
got the gig whoo yay so now that you've

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,550
got this going we need to consider

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,470
cliffs crystal clear contracts I've been

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,660
burned by this so many times it's about

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,709
guaranteed anything that's not mentioned

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,830
in the contract

00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:15,570
will come up absolutely

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,940
I'd actually know some people that have

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,680
no contracts it's all word of mouth and

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,900
a handshake and it drives me totally

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,709
insane but it works for them that's

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,180
great not so much with me so you want to

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:29,970
make sure that you're very clear on

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,190
expectations not just from your end but

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,800
from their end as well

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:38,279
you want to cover payment earns

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,589
copyrights sign offs termination all of

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,500
that nitty-gritty stuff hire a lawyer

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:46,320
and just get it done and you want to be

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,339
very clear about your process and you

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,550
want to gather as much information

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,350
upfront as you can make a solid effort

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,440
to communicate how the project is going

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,810
to roll out so what are the tools that

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,420
you're using is there a learning curve

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,390
right so will you be bringing your

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,520
clients

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,040
on an asana project is there a project

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,260
management tool that you're using if so

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,020
perhaps you need to put together a quick

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,580
video tutorial so that they have the

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,680
basic understandings because a lot of

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,850
people the brains short circuit and I

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,440
like I don't want to learn in you any

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,480
new things but if you lay it out for

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,570
them that will help ease the pain of

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,910
learning something new you want to

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,450
schedule regular check-in meetings so

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,570
say this is an ongoing retainer client

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:33,940
perhaps bimonthly or once a week you

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,730
want to have a set meeting 10:00 to

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,330
10:30 every single Thursday it's on the

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,610
calendar required sign-offs for every

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,220
single phase and a project we do require

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,900
sign offs before we can move forward and

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,600
a tool that I love to use for that is

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,710
hello sign it's digital it's legally

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,720
binding it's super super easy and then

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,790
also be very clear about your client

00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,470
your content due dates right because

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,810
content does tend to be the bane of

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,460
everybody's existence and if there's one

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:09,490
thing that's gonna drag a project on

00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:11,230
forever it's going to be content so what

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,660
we like to do when we bring on a new

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,180
client is we do have an onboarding

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,540
document that we send to them this

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,250
welcomes them and you can certainly do

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,350
this by email this is just a word doc

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,560
that's been linked so that they can jump

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,720
to the various pages you could even

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,640
record a quick video giving a brief

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,410
overview of your process as well and you

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,800
can reuse that time and time again I

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:38,590
think that's fancy and smart and takes a

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,970
lot of the legwork out of it but this

00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:45,700
onboarding document often covers how to

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,770
best get in touch with us we are

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,110
available 9 to 5 Monday through Friday

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,830
please do not text me on the weekends

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:56,260
that's totally inappropriate do you have

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,410
a support team is there a support email

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,020
that you people should be using is there

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,120
a project management tool general

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,840
general expectations and turns of

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,420
feedback and revisions so we like to try

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,810
to keep as much out of email as possible

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,970
and so we have a

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:18,570
system in place for collecting

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,130
everything for two phases of revisions

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,529
rights that we can take care of that in

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,500
one fell swoop and so we lay that all

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:27,990
out for our clients as well and you may

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,880
want to touch on web care as well if you

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,339
have a webcam program you want them to

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,690
be aware of that out the gate before you

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,100
start building a site that they

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,180
understand that that's something that

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,010
they need that needs to be on their

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:44,490
radar and I also like to gather a lot of

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:49,860
a lot of key information upfront so

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:52,230
Google login WP access cPanel added as

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,810
an admin for social media stuff whatever

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,520
the case may be get that all over with

00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,230
but you have it in the bank and you can

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:04,410
use it moving forward and you don't need

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:07,260
to contact the client every other day so

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,089
much like small children clients always

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,070
want explicit parameters and guidelines

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,480
which is totally understandable we all

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,070
want to know what's gonna happen next

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,260
and we want to know what the timeline

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,720
looks like and we want to make sure that

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,380
the people we've paid good money to are

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,990
motivated to complete the project right

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,210
so once we've sent the onboarding

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,700
document off and we've put together some

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,560
regular meetings I will also put

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,350
together a pretty project timeline

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,560
that's easy to read the client can print

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,630
it out they can hang it on their wall

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,320
and refer to it over and over again so

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:46,100
that they understand that we have

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,390
recurring meetings to share updates

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,240
content is due at the beginning which is

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,940
a key component of this digital sign

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:58,830
offs are also mandatory and we're

00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:01,080
motivated to get this thing done so in

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:05,580
general I would recommend integrating

00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,470
the following so firstly under profit

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,770
under-promise and over-deliver whenever

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,350
you can so be super generous to yourself

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,880
and your team and add in lots of padding

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,130
to the timelines that you can always

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,520
deliver early or at the very very least

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:23,490
on time right it's all about keeping the

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,170
client informed and being kind to

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,180
yourself and your team if you have

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,100
regular touches

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:32,810
client and they know that you're on it

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,670
building in that padding as oi is only

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:39,649
going to help build the relationship I

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,450
would also include weekly updates and

00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:45,260
these could be very quick and templated

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,149
emails just to just to pull the client

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,330
is that they understand that work is in

00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:52,820
fact getting done so this could include

00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,830
tasks completed incoming tasks and what

00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:01,640
you need from the client and a story

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:03,770
that's it and then an email curfew so a

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,680
lot of people have boundary issues when

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,200
it comes to email oftentimes you'll get

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,790
a client who expects a response within

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,540
an hour which is completely

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:16,790
inappropriate we need time we have our

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,260
day as scheduled in such a way that we

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,149
can't be available but you know all the

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,330
time so I like to tell my clients that

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:24,800
we will get back to them within 24 hours

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,980
we don't answer emails on the weekend

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,720
and perhaps give them the email to the

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:34,190
dedicated support team if you do in fact

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,650
have one of those and lastly I would

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,500
also consider putting a doorman clause

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,209
in your contracts so for those of you

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,180
who are not familiar with what this is

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:47,060
what it means is at the project if the

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,850
client goes dark and I save for 10 or

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,820
more days the project goes on hold and

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:56,240
it costs X amount of dollars to

00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:59,420
reinstate the project because I can't

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,430
wait for them I can't hold that space I

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,339
have other clients that need attention I

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:07,100
have a family to take care of I have a

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:09,200
business of my own and so it's important

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,709
for them to respect our time and to

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,140
understand that we got other stuff we

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,839
got to do so and of course you could be

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,940
very pleasant about it be upfront

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,560
transparent all of that business and

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:27,800
then just refer back to the contract if

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:30,050
they suddenly decide to disappear so

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,040
content is the bane of every web

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:36,650
designers its existence I have had

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,670
projects go on for literally years

00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:42,950
because I was waiting on

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,630
yes can you get an Amish yeah I'm so

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,990
glad I'm not the only one god it's such

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:50,720
a nightmare so again going back to the

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,959
contract you want to make sure that

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,120
content collection is essential right if

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,920
you don't receive it you'll continue

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,589
with the project right you'll put in a

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,280
bunch of dummy copy rock out lorem ipsum

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,569
like nobody's business and you're doing

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,429
you're holding up your end of the deal

00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,230
right

00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:11,589
and again if they go dormant it's gonna

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,390
cost X number of dollars to reactivate

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,429
and this all goes back to making sure

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:21,559
that your client and is respectful of

00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:25,309
you time now a lot of people struggle

00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,839
with content and know oftentimes people

00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:28,189
don't want to deal with it and I get it

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm not I don't really like to write

00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:33,530
myself so what we do if we encounter

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,669
some pick ups and we're having a hard

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,200
time getting that content we will offer

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:43,280
to put them in touch with a copywriter

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,049
write a think and then hire hopefully

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,419
the conversation happens beforehand and

00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,650
you can hire someone internally or a

00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:51,710
trusted writer and you can tack that

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:55,160
into the project but if it's an

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:59,540
unanticipated hiccup then you can

00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:02,750
connect them with a writer you could run

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,390
a contact a Content planning workshop as

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,700
well so take half a day again you are

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,820
billing the client but you could bring

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,910
in a writer you could all be on-site for

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,160
hours hammer that out get it done have

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,549
him sign off at the end of the day and

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,500
you're done I also have a couple of

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:25,309
tools for collecting Kondo oh one other

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,950
comments if you're unfamiliar with the

00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:29,870
industry that your client is in you

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,090
could also hire a writer to sit down and

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,700
have an interview with them right so a

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,669
video chat or over the phone and person

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,110
of course is always best but I've had

00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:43,010
that's with like a charm in the past for

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:47,150
us I just want to share a couple of

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,040
content collection tools you know

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,280
tried-and-true Dropbox everyone's

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,320
familiar with this

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,720
very stiff I still get pushed back on

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,790
Dropbox from clients believe it or not

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,460
but a quick video tutorial hopefully you

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,190
can can clear that up so make it very

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,930
simple put this file structure together

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,540
for content this is gonna free up your

00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:09,120
inbox that's key keeping as much out of

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,650
your inbox as possible and then make

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,630
sure that they realize that they can in

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,540
fact leave comments in the sidebar so

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,160
you can kind of work together that way

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,650
Google Docs is amazing for this kind of

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,150
thing you can have suggested edits and

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,070
you can kind of work back and forth that

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:27,690
way but some sort of collaborative

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:29,370
content collection tool is our certainly

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:36,740
our best friends this has worked pretty

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:36,740
well for us another really interesting

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,070
approach that we've been using recently

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,830
and again I need to give credit where

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,050
credit is due my friend Simon Kelly of

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,360
renegade Empire showed this to me

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,600
so Trello we're all pretty familiar with

00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,210
Trello right so if you have say a

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,460
regular recurring client maybe you're

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,900
doing digital marketing for them and you

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,120
have certain benchmarks that you want to

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,710
hit but you don't want to be receiving

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,340
emails from them like five times a day

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:08,130
every single day I will put one of these

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,530
together I will invite the client they

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,360
have a wish list they can see what's in

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,150
progress they can see what's been

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,280
completed and then we have our regularly

00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,200
scheduled meetings this is when we can

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,870
start to address what's analyst list

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,730
what's top priority here's the time that

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,050
we're looking at do you need more time

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,820
right do we need to increase spend and

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:32,160
then you're not being bombarded and

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:38,100
constantly interrupted throughout your

00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,900
day so now that you have a system for

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,720
collecting what you need from a client

00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:47,820
now you need to establish regular points

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,590
of contact so we all know that it costs

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,070
way more money to acquire new clients

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:57,510
than to hold on to and continue to work

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,070
with existing clients you want to make

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,810
sure that your clients feel special and

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,620
that you are in fact paying attention to

00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:06,370
them so having regular touch points

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,750
is key and is incredibly important you

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,600
want to be thinking about how you can

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:13,660
add value and surprise your clients

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,790
staying top of mind whenever you can so

00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,430
I have a couple suggestions here for

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:22,110
value ads that you can incorporate into

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:26,200
your regular recurring retainer clients

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:28,210
you could run webinars right that could

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,970
be pre-recorded it could be live you can

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,760
run a QA whatever that looks like and

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:36,070
then those are digital assets that

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,090
you're building you can reference over

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:42,400
time you can give those away for free to

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,530
other clients that you're trying to

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,450
bring into the funnel whatever that

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,620
looks like but that's value and then

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,480
that's something that's also valuable

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,570
valuable to your team because you can

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,450
use that over and over again you could

00:21:52,570 --> 00:22:00,670
put together a client dashboard site is

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:02,320
a very good tool safecom cyf e that can

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:07,210
pull in information from Google

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:09,880
Analytics social media pay-per-click

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,100
stuff whatever that looks like it's nice

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,440
and fancy it gives people like a nice

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,010
50-foot view of what's happening and you

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,360
could say hey we value you as a client

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,100
we were just thinking maybe this is

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,530
something you'd be interested in your

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:27,700
habit go nuts right people would really

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:29,440
appreciate that um you could toss them

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,870
some consultation calls and some regular

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,610
check-ins my favorite of all of these I

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,559
have to say is a private Facebook group

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,170
this is something that we've started

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:41,050
recently called the alchemy business

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,790
accelerator and what it does is it just

00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,400
it's a safe space for small business

00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:48,130
owners to ask us questions engage in

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,880
conversation forge relationships with

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,950
other small business owners

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,150
and it gives us ways to kind of give

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,900
them challenges hold them accountable

00:22:53,150 --> 00:23:02,270
and leads do start to come in from that

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:05,570
group as well so the project is finished

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:08,120
and your clients are super pumped you

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,920
built a website and they're thrilled or

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,710
maybe you've increased online sales by a

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,330
hundred and fifty percent whatever the

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,260
case now's the time to strike while the

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,230
iron is hot

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:22,040
so before you hit the bar with your

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:24,950
colleagues make sure that you ask for

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,780
reviews right especially if you guys

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,960
know it doesn't even matter I mean if

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,270
you're a local business but I I say

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,070
across the board you want to get those

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,450
reviews and I'm not talking testimonials

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,390
which are also lovely those are

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:42,110
fantastic but legitimate reviews on

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:43,790
Google Facebook Yelp Yelp pick your

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,880
poison though I think Google is the best

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,290
because it does help with your rankings

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,740
you want to work that into your process

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:53,270
and don't miss an opportunity to ask for

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,240
those reviews because you probably won't

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,250
get them unless you ask and you could

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,800
also be asking your clients if they're

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,330
looking for referrals right you know

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,110
I've seen what your business can do I'm

00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,850
really excited

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,590
what kind of what's your ideal client

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,390
who should we be looking at and be

00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,790
considering when thinking about your

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:16,570
business so it's I scratch your back you

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:21,980
scratch mine kind of thing and that's it

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:24,170
thanks I all of the slides stuff is here

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,470
and if you're interested in joining the

00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:31,870
Facebook group up over the awesome I try

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,870
to provide as much value as I can and

00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,460
that's it does anybody have questions

00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,600
so it's called the tool that I've seen

00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,620
other people use I haven't used it

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:59,519
myself

00:24:49,620 --> 00:25:00,899
cy Effie mmm-hmm cy Effie calm if you

00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,639
are cute I might have a couple other

00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,230
resources I'm part of a business

00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:05,909
mastermind so I can ask I know that

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,710
they're using dashboards as well so if

00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:10,250
you're looking to get into that I can

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,250
give you some other ideas

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:40,830
yeah totally totally yes so I would say

00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:42,840
if it's a word of mouth of pearl like if

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,370
it came from a trusted referral source

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,190
that could look really different right I

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:50,070
mean the main reason so I come in

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,720
contact with a lot of mom-and-pop small

00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,850
business owners people that I get really

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,190
really excited to help and the problem

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,110
is we sit down you have awesome 45

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,799
minute conversation and then they're

00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:04,919
like we only have 800 dollars yeah you

00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:09,750
know like great like I just I need them

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:13,770
to understand I need to anchor them

00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:17,330
somehow so you can also anchor them and

00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:20,610
within the conversation as well I have a

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:23,340
like a free 15 minute accelerator call

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,700
that I do as well and so I'll hop on the

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,679
phone or do a video chat and give them a

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,980
couple takeaways as quickly as I can and

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,870
then also try to get a feel for for

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,450
their budget because otherwise it just

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,280
becomes a few a huge time-suck another

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,640
thing that I like to do and maybe a

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,650
message is already but um oftentimes

00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,010
people don't know what they need or they

00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:52,020
want so I'll run a discovery session

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:54,570
which is 550 bucks two hours we sit down

00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,210
and talk about all kinds of stuff I will

00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,040
give them a report which they can then

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,809
shop around if they want they don't have

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,030
to hire us but here we've been paid

00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:05,130
upfront and then if they bring us on to

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,790
do a bigger project I take that 550 and

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,790
apply it to the project

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,750
it's bananas and I'm sick of doing it

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,100
and I've sold you know this year

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:22,110
probably 15 discovery sessions and you

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,300
know 75% of the time they have the

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,220
pyrite yeah

00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,650
so that works really well if you want

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:34,820
more information she didn't even want to

00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:34,820
be happy that show you what we do yeah

00:27:37,840 --> 00:28:07,460
when you get

00:27:39,500 --> 00:28:11,140
I mean I think it's a you get what you

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,790
pay for it kind of conversation right so

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:17,270
if they're gonna hire someone on Fiverr

00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:21,980
to crank out some content and my English

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:24,350
isn't their first language like you know

00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,120
I would maybe ask them about pipes that

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:29,770
resonate with them and take a look at

00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:32,840
that copy and then ask them to maybe

00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:35,530
compare and contrast I mean those can be

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,910
tough conversations but again you're

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:40,640
you're the expert and you're the person

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:45,380
that they're looking to to provide them

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,850
some semblance of direction and it's

00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:51,500
better that it happens earlier rather

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:54,050
than later right so you know just isn't

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,120
really what I think I don't think it's

00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,980
doing your business justice right you

00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,360
could take it from that angle and then

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:17,170
offer to put them in touch with a

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:17,170
trustee that's right

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,959
[Music]

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:58,899
so I learned some really hard lessons

00:29:51,309 --> 00:30:03,929
there I'm maybe not the best person I

00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:06,940
think that just positioning yourself and

00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:08,740
being very upfront at the gate and I

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,140
think a lot of it is having some

00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,880
documentation in place where you're sort

00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,440
of like this is boilerplate if you want

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,010
to take a peek at this I'm happy to

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,710
share with you information on how we

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,980
generally put a site together this is

00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:26,950
what the pricing looks like and then let

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,580
that uncomfortable silence fit right

00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,440
don't fill the space and don't try to

00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:35,230
validate yourself to them because you

00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,669
are worth every single penny right and

00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,750
you're the expert and they are coming to

00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:42,250
you for a reason

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:44,230
and you should because you're worth what

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,760
you're worth and there's a really good

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,640
chance that you are going to kick some

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,100
serious ass because they're a friend you

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,559
are going to go above and beyond right

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,789
already so your price is your price and

00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:57,909
you know you're gonna put more work into

00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:59,950
that fight because they're friends but I

00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:03,760
think that starting off at a discounted

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:09,130
rate and what I've learned is people who

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:12,309
come from a place of do not come from a

00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,899
place of abundance right that's when

00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:18,899
they will nickel and dime you to death

00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,899
unfortunately

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:28,520
yeah weird yeah I don't know I mean I

00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:33,620
was just realizing realizing your worth

00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:46,159
is probably step one right just let him

00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:49,669
know your job and it's hard and when

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,590
you're just starting out if you're

00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:53,960
hungry in the beginning and you do come

00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:56,419
from a place of scarcity you're not

00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:01,419
gonna have room for the good stuff if

00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:01,419
you're constantly taking the turkey

00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,299
[Music]

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:21,810
yeah it's sexy right now it's 500 bucks

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:29,190
to reinstate the project I think I'm

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:32,930
gonna face it to the thousand we need to

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,950
understand that it's a great vehicle

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:45,930
yeah exactly

00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:48,480
they want to get the project to Rainier

00:32:45,930 --> 00:33:13,680
like I am not exactly like you just hold

00:32:48,480 --> 00:33:14,640
that time aside ready P we're done two

00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,610
years

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:21,870
- content yes was not the person's first

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:27,290
language French so you know still like

00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:30,290
it was not good it was horrible luckily

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,290
so

00:33:35,830 --> 00:34:01,519
Wow yeah from a good point

00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:05,479
you can be too democratic in the Soviet

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,950
dictator Yeah right but this was a

00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:09,289
company that I worked for look they're

00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,599
the ones I have exam for this and the

00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:14,169
company who created it and just let it

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,169
sit and

00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,909
[Music]

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,530
that's awesome that's what through

00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:52,859
they've been sitting because the content

00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:54,750
oh I actually have another quick tip for

00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:57,330
you guys that I haven't vetted myself

00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,650
but I've got I have some trusted

00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:02,220
colleagues that have used this it's

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:04,890
called text broker calm so if you guys

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,470
run social media stuff they need to do

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,690
some blogging for clients etc etc you

00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:16,920
can put in content orders and I hear

00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:20,780
it's solid text broker yeah text broker

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,780
dot-com so put that in your back pocket

00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:36,650
I mean I yeah it's not what I want to be

00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:40,130
doing but yes I'm doing a little bit of

00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:45,100
project management are you a project

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:45,100
manager yeah

00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:58,700
our tools right now so we we use asana

00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:04,580
to write all of the processes we use

00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:06,920
slack for internal communication that I

00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,990
mean we use teamwork a little bit but I

00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,900
use it in a very weird way and that has

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:17,000
to do with our web care programs that we

00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:20,800
do our web care plans those are probably

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,800
our these are main tools at the moment

00:36:52,700 --> 00:37:10,320
yeah well then that and then taking time

00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,690
away then you're forced to multis have

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,760
and you're putting out fires as opposed

00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,590
to scheduling your day in a way that

00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,350
makes sense and it enables you to be

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:22,940
efficient so my suggestion to you would

00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:28,460
be give Trello to another NGO use bluem

00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:31,440
to create a video and then Nathan ello

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:35,790
ome calm this is what I use to

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,500
communicate with my team constantly so

00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,240
the quick videos you're sharing your

00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,390
screen you're talking through whatever

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,859
and then you can organize it in a

00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,480
library which I haven't done any

00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,890
organizing but you could you could

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,840
actually hand this off to your teammate

00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:54,950
and then say watch this create a process

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,150
and the sana Google Docs whatever right

00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,220
but that's a really nice way to make

00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:02,250
quick videos for clients you can make a

00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,450
library lessons them in the future but

00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,609
there's a good chance they just need

00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,350
someone to show them how to how to do it

00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:09,510
and then something that they can be like

00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,560
oh what did she say we needed to do and

00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,330
then she could they watch the

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,330
five-minute video again yeah

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:34,960
no it's a drop-off it seems like Dropbox

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,520
and Trello I try to think of how many

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,680
different realities in phones yeah

00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,890
there's so simple to use that and Google

00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,890
Docs

00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,850
[Music]

00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:07,150
I know so it's important to meet them

00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,170
where they are with videos right you

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,910
don't want to burn a bunch of time

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,900
trying to teach them how to do things

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,500
and I'm I enjoy you to be done I'm out

00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,750
of here

00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,750
