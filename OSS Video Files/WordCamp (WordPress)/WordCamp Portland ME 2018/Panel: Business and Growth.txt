years and really respect what you've

00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:57,850

alonzo is the CEO of eleven online a

00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:18,969
digital agency in New Mexico Alonzo had

00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:21,579
been working in nonprofits and decided

00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:25,029
to go back and try a different career

00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:27,399
went to a coding bootcamp was what a

00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:30,459
six-week program this is a nine-week

00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:35,770
program entire nine-week program and

00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:37,569
came out started an agency and within a

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:42,039
year and a half two years had 11

00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:43,779
employees and really you know that's

00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:45,700
grown grown really quickly and done a

00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:49,090
lot of high quality work it's been

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,539
impressive to watch Cory you know from

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:56,139
earlier today bill tie things up from

00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:58,539
scratch to be one of the premier

00:01:56,139 --> 00:02:02,969
companies in the WordPress space and

00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:05,459
just sold it earlier this year and

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,549
Jessie worked with me and Bert protect

00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,550
and

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,380
helped was you were what customer

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,270
champion what was your director of

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:19,489
innovation director of innovation has

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:23,569
such a good title and did an amazing job

00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:28,130
of helping us determine a product and a

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:33,470
focus and grow and it's really a key

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:35,840
member of the team so Jesse is now an

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,170
automatic and works on growth and

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,850
partnerships for Jim pack so these guys

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,519
know what they're talking about

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,470
I wanted to kick things off with a

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,200
question and then we just sort of let

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:52,160
some questions come in and go where it

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,530
goes but I'm wondering for you guys what

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,319
a typical day looks like how do you

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,319
structure your time to be most effective

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:10,010
okay yes I think that's something that

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,980
is a constantly iterating and this

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:16,519
constant struggle and constant battle so

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,709
I do I'm basically doing most of the

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,329
sales processes at this stage with our

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:24,980
company and most of the strategic

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:28,970
initiatives growth and development and

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:32,359
stuff like that so typically peppered

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,100
throughout my day our calls with

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:38,540
potential clients calls with existing

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:41,450
clients and then what's really really

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:45,500
important for me is I block off time in

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:48,019
my calendar for let's say it could be

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:53,049
anything from working on a response to

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:56,600
an RFP it could be it could be writing

00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:59,510
it could be community engagement of some

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,420
kind or a networking piece of some of

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,060
some sort that is actually the most

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,639
critical component and I have to

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,959
probably be more aggressive about

00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,910
blocking off those times because what

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,040
happens is

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,860
calendar you know I don't know if you

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,340
guys calendly or service like that I I

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,870
sent that out to people like they want

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,220
to set up a meeting or whatever I send

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,860
that out to people and then before I

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,820
know it like I look at my next week and

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,800
it's like I got no time so I you know I

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,900
have to be more kind of planful and

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,910
aggressive about that but so it

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,040
typically looks like I try and try and

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,880
get going after a drop the kids off and

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:44,290
so around 9:00 I try and quit around

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,390
5:00 or 5:30 I try not to work at night

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,830
after the kids go to bed you're getting

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,260
better at that I know you used to have a

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:54,730
real problem I did yeah well the house

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,620
is so quiet and you know so but but yeah

00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,950
I mean that that just that has

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,120
consequences if you keep doing that so

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,520
yeah roughly that's what it looks like

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,030
to me

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,280
so broadly I would say for me I think an

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,260
effect of what took us a long time to

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,670
try to empower our team to make

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:17,560
decisions based on values and stories

00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:20,980
frees me up quite a bit and then I

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,440
probably into you know meetings which

00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,690
are trying to facilitate conversations I

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,360
try to stay out of meetings as much as I

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,890
can because I realized pretty early on

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,820
that when I was in meetings that cause

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,070
problems and I don't like them anyway so

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,410
and then I think you know the occasional

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:42,070
fire or conversation that needs to have

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:45,250
but mostly it's around slack and I'm

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,230
still kind of an introvert so I like you

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,530
know my office is in the corner of our

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:55,480
office in Oklahoma City where I get to

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,790
be the hermit yeah sometimes I'll just

00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,130
add two little things I use calendly all

00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,780
the time it's a great tool you can send

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,860
out a link and people can schedule time

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:11,710
with you I used to allow that to kind of

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:14,080
go on without kinda any filter but now

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,210
what I really found is that meetings

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,770
tend to either delay the process because

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,700
you're trying to find time to sync when

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:24,430
you could be having these conversations

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:26,500
and slack or email so tried not to have

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,030
a meeting unless it's actually important

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,039
or going to drive the conversation

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,760
forward and then the other thing I would

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,320
add is that when you talked about

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,910
blocking out part of your calendar

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,460
something I've been trying lately is

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,320
that I scheduled a whole bunch of things

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,990
that I want to do every day at around

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,570
the 4:00 a.m. block and then the night

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,770
before or early in the morning I'll just

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:53,229
shift those around my schedule down each

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,870
day so whether it's taking a class or

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:58,570
writing up some notes from something or

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,310
going to the gym I have a bunch of these

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,840
little blocks at the top of my calendar

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,160
I kind of slide them around so that I

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,560
know I can fit them in during the day

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,840
and it's also a reminder not to forget

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:14,530
to do it yeah you don't do them in

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,840
fourth O'Kelly right now is set from 6

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,870
a.m. to 2 p.m. for me so I'll take calls

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:24,840
early as 6 a.m. it's not 4 but that's

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,840
only for your our European and Asian oh

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:32,140
I'm an early bird yeah yeah sure sure

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,440
that's a great idea if it knows at 4

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,440
a.m. and

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,630
mr. Glenn skates so I'm really curious

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:49,750
how do you all find time in your

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:57,030
routines that you experiment with new

00:07:49,750 --> 00:08:00,220
ways how do you work that into your team

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,050
working with your current ways I have a

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,970
four-day work week on everything else

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,860
Monday through Fridays most of my

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,570
business stuff and Monday through

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,610
Thursdays most of my business stuff my

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,290
partnership meetings my all the other

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,420
stuff and Fridays I've literally

00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,520
dedicated towards this stuff that we're

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,900
working on now around innovating on

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,120
marketing and things like that that

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,380
whole day is blocked off I take no

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:27,280
meetings no nothing like that

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:31,690
yeah so for for me you know we have

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,550
weekly partner meetings and a chunk of

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,849
that is reserved for exactly what you're

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,950
talking about looking at new workflows

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,030
or updated workflows or looking at tools

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,310
it can make us be a little more

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:46,780
efficient it's if you're not doing that

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,550
you're dying and I think part of it is

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,680
also you know there's I've definitely

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:56,230
seen that you know the desire to sort of

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,090
tool your way out of everything and like

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,280
have the flashy new tool and stuff like

00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:02,700
that um so I think it helps when you

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,560
have multiple people sort of brainpower

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,840
be able to be able to kind of think on

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,000
and think about how we can improve or

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,290
affect our processes and then we have

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,200
action items that come out of those

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,200
right hey we'll discuss it it looks

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,690
promising you know here's your action

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,700
item for the next partner meeting test

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,320
it out play around with it and see where

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,970
we see where I think we think it could

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,440
fit you think you can fit and then and

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:32,560
report back so it's just it's I think

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,270
it's just it's part of our culture from

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,700
the standpoint of we're in New Mexico

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:42,420
and every little edge helps is it's a

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,620
small market and you know it's it's not

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,820
you know we're very lucky we have some

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,540
great out-of-state clients

00:09:45,820 --> 00:10:03,190
but it's a tough market so every little

00:09:49,540 --> 00:10:13,150
bit counts really to get first clients

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:15,450
or customers the thing that worked is I

00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:19,720
think continued continually putting

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:21,430
educational helpful content out so we

00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,200
start out themes and I had this set of

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,040
tutorials that I had built and I was

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,750
trying to sell them and then they

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,550
weren't really selling and I had a

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,620
copywriter friend go wife script us for

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:33,610
free so that was our tutorial section

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:36,070
which became some of our longest well

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,280
ranked well trafficked content that

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,960
became a huge lead for us so the power

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,140
wordpress everything we do is being able

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,700
to put SEO longtail top content online I

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,250
think it's a strategy over and over and

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,680
over that whatever almost any business

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,480
being able to so that's how we drive a

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:58,540
lot of our lead generation I guess to

00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:02,230
date and then use email to capture one

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,350
thing that Matt Mullenweg at automatic

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:08,680
our CEO told me which really resonated

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:13,210
with me was good partners motivate small

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,800
slow partners so this idea was so the

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,440
work that I do is not on a typical

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,960
client basis right we're not building

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,700
websites for large companies or

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,500
something like that what we're the work

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,030
that I'm doing is more around partnering

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,580
with hosting companies and things like

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,980
that to distribute jetpack and this

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,070
program that exists today that you can

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,650
see in in motion dream host and a

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:39,490
variety of other companies didn't exist

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:41,310
just 18 months ago so what we ended up

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,170
doing was just really kind of like

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,570
getting introductions cold calling by

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,610
identifying partners that would be great

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,710
partners and just working really hard to

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,900
get them and then being very transparent

00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,660
about our partnership with those

00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,260
companies

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,450
and that drove a great deal of traffic

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,610
for us to build an entire business or

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,080
partnership program around that and I

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,480
think that would translate the same way

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,160
for clients if you get if you land a

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,990
very large client and you can be very

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,450
transparent about it and and innovate

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,120
and do something really cool with them

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,590
that'll drive excitement around your

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,050
brands and and the things that you're

00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,830
building so writing case studies and

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,350
post-mortems

00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:24,080
yeah even just a simple partners page or

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:38,030
client list page is enough sometimes you

00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:40,640
know okay

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,100
so this kind of brings me back right

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,950
like when we first started like coming

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,800
out of the boot camp I didn't know

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,750
anything like no I mean I knew how to

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,760
build some sites I started learning

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,500
about WordPress you know I knew some

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,090
fundamentals but as far as like business

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,440
nothing hadn't come from like a family

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:05,870
of entrepreneurs or any of that stuff I

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,800
went a lot with just instincts right and

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,320
so one of my instincts was we just got

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,580
to do work and so I went to friends

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:20,270
family that's where we started and then

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:22,130
started I'm entertaining the trades one

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,520
of the first WordPress sites we built

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:29,810
was for like a rummage furniture rummage

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:33,110
store and in Albuquerque and we did it

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,280
for old furniture so I still have some

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,670
of that stuff in my house it's pretty

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:40,910
cool but just just start building our

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:43,550
workflows and our processes and you know

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:47,620
the first real contract that got was

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:52,280
from a friend from high school and then

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:54,050
I started going to you know just

00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,000
different networking events it what I

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,670
can't tell you you asked what what

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,870
didn't work what doesn't

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:08,150
don't be the card dealer and like some

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,150
of these you know network things of it

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,510
it's that with the networking stuff and

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,800
and getting to know people in the

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,280
community if you're doing one of the

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,070
work it's a long play it's a long-term

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,570
investment you're building relationships

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,160
passing out cards does not build

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,370
relationships it just makes you look

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,260
like shell and crass and as far as I'm

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,370
concerned and so like if you're just if

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,200
you're engaging people and letting

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,410
people know what you do and building

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,660
real relationships a lot of the

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,920
relations I've built then they didn't

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,320
pay off right there and then but

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,580
eventually they manifested themselves

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,470
into referrals or you know so so if I

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,460
don't know I think fondly on that time

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,280
because I really didn't know what the

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,250
hell I was doing I just kind of enough

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,399
how long have you been in that patient

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,399
[Music]

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,730
let me let me help connect what I said

00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,770
earlier to your particular case like it

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,360
I would so you two years you've been

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,130
working with clients and they probably

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,290
have a set of common questions they ask

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,140
every single time right yeah that's the

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,700
stuff you put on your website now SEO is

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,010
a whole other thing but what I'm saying

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,920
is so how I would use this specifically

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,750
for your context is all those common

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,120
questions people ask that's gold

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,530
because see you know you're the expert I

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,720
don't even know how to start working

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,370
with you so but there's probably common

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,650
questions that you can turn in put into

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,530
either an FAQ and the e-book whatever

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,270
and then I would say open source your

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,660
expertise and here's what I mean by that

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,700
is you you have keys sensual things that

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,480
you probably do that are like in that

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,520
you know died dietitian 101 kind of

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,540
category and I would put that all online

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:55,080
and here's why and may be considered to

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,970
your personality is video audio stuff

00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,200
like that because another thing it's oh

00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,730
you're thinking of your customer and

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,830
you're going okay when they hit my

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,320
website how do I lower all the barriers

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,840
for the

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,150
to work with me so if they keys right I

00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,560
mean one of those key critical questions

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,390
that they could learn before you even

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,310
calling you and you're educating your

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:15,100
customer so here's the question though

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,320
do you want your customers to become put

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,480
all that on your site it's free 24/7

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,690
lower all the barriers what's the

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,150
biggest barrier that you your clients

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,180
have to work with you and demolish it

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:31,270
with content on your site and then maybe

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,820
use vehicles like you know if you like

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:38,170
doing video video series like here's my

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,790
tips of the week for X and then the

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,580
other phrase I would look and you know

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,320
just Google is local SEO so I don't know

00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,230
how your businesses shape but so for

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,530
instance if you're in Portland here

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,940
somebody's hitting dietitian into Google

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,290
but you're the Portland google knows

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,870
they're in Portland kind of thing that

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,190
I'm not an SEO expert I'm just saying

00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,480
that's something to probably dive into

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,460
you

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,140
absolutely yeah the personalization side

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,480
of that is really important so if you're

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,760
if you're servicing a local community

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,470
you should define that in your site so

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,890
that Google can understand that and then

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,630
gives you a niche to if you're the only

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,310
one if you're one of three dietitians in

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,290
the area and it's a lot easier for you

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,000
to compete against ten thousand across

00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,820
the country it's like in the old days

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,290
everybody would be in the phonebook but

00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,449
you can have an edge with that like if

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,250
your business is is local like face to

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:31,480
face here then

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:34,690
local SEO is Portland dietitian you know

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,220
kind of state I would have one more

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:42,790
thing on to that and and that's just

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:44,800
that it can become really easy to feel

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,450
like I can't I can't give this over

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,610
information away for free because this

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,620
is what I want people to pay me for but

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:54,100
that's not what people people are paying

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,080
but if you can if you can establish use

00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:00,400
that to establish yourself as an expert

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:04,630
and give them that starter they're still

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,130
gonna want to engage you so that they

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,040
can come up with a plan

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:12,850
specifically for them but yeah by

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,230
putting that information out there yeah

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,480
you're gonna see traffic and you're

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:19,450
gonna you're gonna establish yourself as

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:38,470
an expert super chair very true and get

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:44,500
the edge yeah yes so hiring is the

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:46,690
question tips on hiring yeah

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,140
automatic has a really unique hiring

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,460
process by which we put out an ad on our

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,590
site we actually get a decent amount of

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,420
traffic to that so that's easy to to

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,190
bring in resumes we review the resume

00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:01,360
and then we go through an entire trial

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:03,640
process so it's comprised of several

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,490
interviews and then it's an actual paid

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,990
work for hire kind of scenario but you

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,260
could work for a couple weeks or a

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,610
couple months on a specific project and

00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,560
the goal of that is really to understand

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,330
that instead of your skill level but to

00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,790
understand your communication abilities

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,770
and and how you blend with the teams and

00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,220
work well with you know the rest of us

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:26,020
as far as a favorite question I usually

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,400
like to just kind of create open-ended

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,970
questions that help people talk about

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,890
themselves because I mean I can ask very

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,200
simple questions but if I get one-word

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,820
answers there it's will be added all day

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,800
all right so I want to hear what it is

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,970
that you're passionate about and what it

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,980
is that makes you think that you're

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,250
different than the ten other candidates

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:49,060
for the position

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:51,840
so I over 10 years we've you know

00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:54,970
interviewed how many people right and

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:59,320
I'll say that it's not a magical formula

00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:01,690
for me at all it's it's part art there's

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,640
some science to it but there's so many

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,010
you know job interview things out there

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,620
that anybody can pull you you know and

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,860
we've been formed but I would say the

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,870
biggest distinguish

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,270
and in just my context of 20 people not

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:17,270
like 500 Adam I don't know what you guys

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,730
are at the close to it on their 800 an

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:22,160
automatic I have not scaled to that but

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,410
I would say because of this thing

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,350
criteria I'm going to give you so I

00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:29,000
don't know how it would operate at 800

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,730
but if I don't want them or wouldn't

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,610
trust them to be in my home they're not

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,020
on my team and if I don't enjoy them

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,710
like I don't we don't have to be best

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,900
friends but if we can't like and so work

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:46,549
with other people in the team they don't

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:49,940
fit so fit is first and then skill you

00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:52,370
know fit first do they are they you know

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,280
do I have enough of information to see

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,110
that they're gonna like sync Jesse and I

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,000
are gonna see you know ones are gonna

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,799
sink because it's a woman water

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,809
sometimes and that can be pretty bad

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,270
we've and we've got that before where we

00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,280
had to go no you don't fit you need to

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,460
leave you fit somewhere else you know

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:22,220
you're not a bad person

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:23,900
how do you fire so I I am a people of

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,990
people I want to care about people and

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:30,590
into these big guys for me but through

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:34,580
pain of having people with me on the

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:37,220
team for too long I cared less about

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,320
that like if you don't so I've gotten

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,990
less and less and less where it's just

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,580
like sorry you don't you don't belong

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,620
here you belong somewhere else there's

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,760
somewhere that probably fits you so you

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,429
don't belong here and I've gotten easier

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,100
about doing that and so it's really

00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:54,490
simple conversations now where first few

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:59,179
times are really hard first you times so

00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:00,830
they all set by the way yeah and so it's

00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,110
but it they become shorter because it's

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,600
like I'm sorry it's not working out and

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,830
then why I'm sorry it's not working I'd

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
love to help you with that but there's a

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,429
lot of constraints where you gotta be

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,770
careful right and so it's just that

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:17,120
there's that Billy Beane movie Moneyball

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:20,210
you know that where Jonas yeah you know

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,210
it is real quick sorry

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:26,450
Thanks it's not like that it's not like

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:29,690
that but I've gotten less you know it's

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,700
more about you don't you don't do you

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,580
freeze them up to go someone else too by

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,990
the way do you tend to do performance

00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:42,320
improvement plan before firing or do you

00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,940
go straight to dismissal not formally

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,580
and you know we're only two twenty or so

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,309
but it's it's like you got a couple

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,169
strikes yeah and if it's just not

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,960
working out I think it's typically I was

00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:56,960
at a meeting one time and we needed to

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,879
let go of a person and they had me you

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,110
know they said do you who here has

00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:04,159
someone that you know you need to fire

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:07,100
knows me left and he was like you know

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:10,909
sometimes people will stay longer than

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,950
they need to and no it's bad drove the

00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:16,970
office said sorry it's not working out

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:19,730
the person goes I was wondering why it

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,499
took you two so long you know and that

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,669
person get freed up to go find somewhere

00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:24,850
where she's supposed to be so I think

00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:28,820
it's a double thing pain and then free

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:33,350
yeah they usually know oh yeah they know

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:36,139
yeah so yeah just generally hiring week

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:39,529
we really have had some good success and

00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:41,419
found some great people hiring

00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:44,809
non-traditional where all the all four

00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:47,269
partners are from non-traditional you

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:52,460
know not necessarily undergrad she has

00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:54,080
backgrounds and so a lot of people we

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,789
hired we hired them as junior or

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,190
entry-level we've hired some people out

00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:00,740
of the same boot camp we went to and

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:03,049
actually it was interesting was I think

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,899
one of the one of the ideas that I had

00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:08,450
that I think it really allowed us to

00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:10,820
scale you know I was thinking a lot

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,950
about well what what kind of makes us

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,409
different in the context of the local

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,450
ecosystem and I thought oh yeah I went

00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:18,769
to the boot camp nobody around here

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,369
knows what to do with people coming out

00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:24,740
of this boot camp but maybe we do right

00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:27,799
so so that I think so we've had the

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,629
attitude of giving looking for

00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,020
inefficiencies in the market and like

00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:34,690
giving people shots and

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:38,290
there they typically are very loyal and

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:42,820
worked really really hard so so there's

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:45,510
that as far as letting people go you

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:49,690
know first time I had to do it it was

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:52,120
really rough it's really rough and then

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,280
I had to you know a couple three or four

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:59,410
months ago I had to let go for the first

00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:01,570
person we hired and you know I had to do

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,190
it it just it wasn't working out it

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,280
wasn't working out and and our business

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,720
is kind of pivoted a little bit and you

00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,790
know the person wasn't able to help us

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:14,500
the way we needed and it you know in my

00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:17,980
mind I just built it up as like just

00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,559
this painful horrible thing and then

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:25,240
what I realized what and it became true

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:28,570
like when when she left was we leveled

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:32,220
her up and someone else went and grabbed

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,760
her and we're we're both happier and

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,059
she's my friend

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,040
so you know like you know like I don't

00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,750
know I'm proud of how that whole thing

00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,630
worked out it's just sometimes it needs

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,960
to happen and I think you know if you

00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,730
have if you do do things in good faith

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,590
and people can sense that and realize

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,429
that I understand that I think it's a

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,880
little bit easier

00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:56,110
okay okay beyond that yeah look so that

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,590
just resonate with me too

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:03,730
so when we have fired people we have

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:05,740
probably given people more than then

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,110
maybe they should have but with one

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,450
defining characteristic I can go to

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,090
sleep at night so I do the right thing

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,679
that's my right and if I don't know I'm

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,270
doing the right thing at night and

00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,670
consider night that's not always the

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,620
case for the other person by the way but

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:25,000
if I know I've done the right thing I'm

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:28,179
good and I think too that that that

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,760
hiring process is and needs to be a lot

00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:33,760
different when you are you know a

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,350
company of five it looks different than

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,179
when you're a company of twenty which

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:40,030
looks way different when you're a

00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,700
company of hundreds yeah you know when

00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,760
when you're a small team it's

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,470
culture fit number one right culture fit

00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:53,519
and for me it was always culture fit and

00:26:48,470 --> 00:27:00,690
drive or capability and then skill a

00:26:53,519 --> 00:27:04,320
distant third Derek when when I hired

00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:13,139
Derek years ago he didn't have much

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:15,570
skill no no I mean he but he fit in well

00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:18,120
with the team and I could tell that he

00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,549
he wanted to get better yeah he was

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:24,870
really passionate about it and he came

00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:27,360
in and did an amazing job and is now one

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,950
of the lead engineers working on jet

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,250
pack having his software used by

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:37,919
millions of people every day in the

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:39,659
course of like four years that's that's

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,299
always worked out really well no good

00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:49,409
job there but there yeah that's if you

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:50,789
have people who mesh well especially

00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:53,429
when you're a small company it's all

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:58,590
about like having each other's backs and

00:27:53,429 --> 00:28:01,679
going to war together every day so you

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:06,889
have to be a hundred percent on the same

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,889
team at same page yeah

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,119
[Music]

00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:43,679
scaling is and hiring or scaling I'll

00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:46,649
let you guys handle that one well you

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,779
know I think that we had an interesting

00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:51,840
scenario with the jetpack a product that

00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:53,009
was built for the web for free it was

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,250
something that we gave back to the

00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:59,129
community for five years before we put

00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:02,929
any kind of plans or revenue behind it

00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:05,940
and now we've got a pricing model and a

00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:07,440
plan system and everything in place but

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,049
we're still kind of struggling with that

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,419
because it's built on the foundation of

00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:15,330
something that was never really meant to

00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:17,490
to grow in that way but you know I think

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,230
that what really happens for us one of

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,389
the things that I could just give you as

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,629
a tip was just internally for us we had

00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:26,639
an entire division dedicated towards

00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:28,320
giving something away for free and we

00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:31,559
had to change the entire mindset of that

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,870
entire corporate structure right so when

00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,360
it came time to scale and to kind of

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:39,090
grow out of that mindset it just took a

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,480
lot of very determined people kind of

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,220
like churning away every single day and

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,470
setting the standard it's the new

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,809
standard for the company from a

00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,220
leadership perspective so I would kind

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:51,149
of say that translates to whatever it is

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:56,210
that you're working on I'll let these

00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:56,210
guys answer a deeper level more granular

00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,799
when you scale your workflow and your

00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:10,289
process has changed they have to do and

00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:14,519
so for B it's been invest in that you

00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:16,110
know yeah because that so I guess you

00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,039
know it really depends on on your goals

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,840
right so for me I'm crazy like I I just

00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:26,379
want to ride this thing

00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,149
I want to take as far as I can right and

00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:31,389
you know there are lots of people and

00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:33,490
this is not a you know no disrespect at

00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:35,649
all you're probably much saner and

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,669
mentally healthier than I am if you want

00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:39,429
to just build like a boot little

00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:42,190
boutique operation that's that's super

00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:47,110
cool it's never really been my thing

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:49,750
and so I've I felt like I've every time

00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:52,990
that I've pushed to invest in the long

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,639
term in the long plate like okay maybe

00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,940
we're not gonna have as many billable

00:30:54,639 --> 00:31:00,129
hours this month but we're going to you

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,220
know upend our process and make this

00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:05,889
thing more efficient it's paid off

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,690
eventually so if I think that's just a

00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:10,210
great driving principle to have always

00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,919
but especially in that because you can

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:15,009
have old processes that work for you at

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,960
a certain scale are nonsense when you

00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:19,480
try and scale and then the pain of

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:25,750
negotiating that on the fly is not worth

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:29,169
it so find your your magic like your

00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:33,340
superpower and the thing that you enjoy

00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:37,149
and delegate and empower everything else

00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,740
like so I had a bunch of hats one when I

00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:40,809
first and I think okay I'll do did the

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,120
support hat this that I go I don't want

00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:45,309
this out of hat and so I was like first

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,440
chance I could here's the Hat take it

00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,389
see you later but I would say generally

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,429
speaking scale wise or whatever the

00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:53,379
magic formula is fun the thing that like

00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:55,929
drives you and that you're really good

00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:58,840
at and then get and I'm good at like two

00:31:55,929 --> 00:32:01,779
things and everything else I find the

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,940
best I can't or develop them to take all

00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:05,200
that stuff that that's their magic you

00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,240
know I'm saying and that's the power of

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,009
a team today by the way like when

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,679
everybody's jiving doing they're like

00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:13,480
the thing that drives them this sings in

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,549
their heart and that's where the cool

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,200
stuff happens yeah but the common the

00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,690
common theme with those all these

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,299
answers is that you need someone in a in

00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,039
a leadership role right to guide those

00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:26,409
individuals through that that flow

00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,970
whether it's chaos and craziness or

00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:30,250
you're just scaling

00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:33,250
and building stuff you need someone with

00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,169
the vision and and defining a vision

00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,789
especially in those times when you're

00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:38,559
starting to really start to scale and

00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,230
move up is something that everyone in

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,519
the company should be leaning against

00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,840
because then you know exactly whether or

00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:45,340
not you're you're you're moving in the

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,200
right direction and it's easier to take

00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:51,159
risks because you know that that risk is

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:56,830
defined in a way to you know promote or

00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:59,799
sustain that vision and to that there

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:04,240
was something that Corey said earlier

00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:09,220
about having a set of shared values as a

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:14,500
company and a overall mission and by

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:16,120
having that explicitly defined then you

00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,149
tell people you know as long as you're

00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,980
operating within that spirit and within

00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:23,259
those values and towards that goal

00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,120
you're doing the right thing so you if

00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:27,730
you can communicate that higher level

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,019
vision and then allow people even use

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,870
that as a framework

00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:33,610
I really like that yeah stories of the

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,500
best way to for values now I'm just I'm

00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,289
looking at risk in retrospect but

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,350
stories are the best ways to enforce

00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:43,750
that enforce and share the values to

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,059
actually resonate so we had a security

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,879
breach four or five years ago me and my

00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:51,190
right hander and Europe the team back in

00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:52,750
Oklahoma City and in spreadin hike you

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,809
know we're just getting the work done

00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:58,559
I tell it sort of all time because I

00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:01,509
want the people that didn't go all in to

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,659
understand that's not what you do like

00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,639
what we do is we go all in and the

00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:09,190
stories help with the values them with

00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:12,730
you to jesse is like its leaders you're

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,079
the lid like this guy's you can get part

00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:21,679
of the size the organization will go

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:22,829
right sorry so yeah

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,659
[Music]

00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:27,629
like reading strategically being like

00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,599
your saw so as you guys were watching

00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:32,639
that what came up for in your mind like

00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:37,559
what has been your kind of secret weapon

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:47,069
as you grow the visitors transition what

00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:49,769
are those things for I talked a little

00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:51,179
bit about risk before that's been kind

00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:53,549
of like the thing that I keep going back

00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,929
to for me and the success that I've seen

00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,930
and the work that I've been doing is

00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,359
that there's a few things that I've

00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:04,229
worked on over the last few years they

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:06,170
if I had just defined them and let

00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:08,729
people tell me how bad of an idea it was

00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,799
they would never have coming to fruition

00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:12,839
and a lot of those things that actually

00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:15,660
make up a decent amount of the revenue

00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:17,700
that we're seeing for our company now so

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,729
for me it was a risk because it was my

00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,769
job because I'm going against a good

00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:25,259
amount of people but it was also a risk

00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:26,640
because even if everybody agreed that

00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:28,039
it's a good idea it's still a risk you

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,430
don't know if it's gonna work so

00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:39,029
something like that well-defined smart

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:41,299
risks for me has been big payoff I'm

00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:50,130
gonna give you a brewery answer

00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:52,049
I'm starving as hell just like okay so

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,150
when I was so before I went to the boot

00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:56,729
camp I thought to myself that'd be cool

00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:59,819
like you know in college that like

00:35:56,729 --> 00:36:04,199
taking a few CS classes in my previous

00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:07,769
job I'd worked with programmers and you

00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:10,469
know and so my like my wife had her

00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:13,589
daughter and so it was a great

00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:15,490
opportunity to kind of put the paws on

00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,890
my career that wasn't really happy

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,660
anyway and be a stay-at-home dad so I

00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,550
did after a little bit and then I was a

00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,070
couple years later I wasn't kind of

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,840
itching to get back because being

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,240
productive is a really important part of

00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,180
my life it always has been in the

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,550
context of work so so went to boot camp

00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,410
and I thought you know this will help me

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,990
sort of get like be able to freelance

00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:40,030
and be able to stay home and work from

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:44,410
home which is something it was important

00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:46,690
to me with with young kids but then I in

00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,160
the boot camp we had you know we had

00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,130
guest speakers come in and there was a

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,310
guest speaker and he had started an

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:58,600
agency in Albuquerque they expanded out

00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:02,140
to Dallas and they did a lot of really

00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,210
meaningful work for nonprofits like at

00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,140
that like you know that kind of put see

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:11,320
like you know this this sort of project

00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,510
of building this bigger thing that got

00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,240
me really excited and so I think that

00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:18,250
was probably the beginning of it for me

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,500
and then since then I feel like part of

00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:25,180
it it's always it's just been like I'm

00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:28,180
going to prove to myself that I can do

00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,130
this enormous thing and I'm gonna take

00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,640
it as far as I can take it it sort of an

00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:37,390
exercise in like self-discipline and you

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,840
know belief which does not come natural

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,650
to me

00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:44,320
I like of course talk about reading I

00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:46,090
like reading but I don't love reading

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,930
like business books I like reading like

00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:57,760
you know Gatsby stuff like that right

00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:59,859
and and also you know you know none of

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,630
that stuff comes all that natural to

00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:03,790
meet these like long-term sort of things

00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,340
so so this is almost just a challenge

00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:09,550
myself

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:12,010
and I've also been damn lucky so so that

00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:14,710
combination of stubbornness meeting the

00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:18,280
right people a little bit of luck you

00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:19,960
make your own luck and sometimes you you

00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,400
meet many people sometimes you me that's

00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,320
another thing I I didn't do it by myself

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,950
I'd be partners I always had partners

00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:30,930
man moral support of partners

00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:35,310
just so amazing and for me just vital

00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:38,329
you know so we are now into break time

00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:40,380
if we got started a few minutes late so

00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:42,780
if you guys want to take a couple more

00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,500
questions and I'm good with that but if

00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,820
you if you want to go get a snack go for

00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:54,240
that actually I'm not sure that there

00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:57,020
are snacks but I think there may be the

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,020
leftover cookies

00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:04,099
