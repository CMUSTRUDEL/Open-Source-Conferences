Title: Bradley Maravalli: WP Time Management
Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	At my job as a web developer at GreenBananaSEO, the senior web developer without notice left the company due to stress. It was now up to me to take on his work and lead the web department. My time management skills were put to the test in order to become the most productive web developer I can possibly be.
The first half of the lesson will be the tips & tricks learned from from the popular time-management books ‘Getting Things Done’ by David Allen and ‘Eat That Frog’ by Brian Tracy. These tips & tricks can be used by anybody – designers, bloggers, designers, developers, etc.
The second half of the lesson will be how I implemented time management in WordPress development: task management, web maintenance, web development, theme development, plugin use & recommendations, launching sites, creating your own checklists, and more. All of this in order to increase productivity while continuing to build quality sites.

00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,010
development I was a software engineer

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:55,019
before this in short things it's just it

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,940

00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,519
I call it rich dad get read the book

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,370
Rich Dad Poor Dad who kind of took me

00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,350
under his wings said oh hi you on the

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,020
spot and on WordPress and ever since

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,280
it's been just been extremely fortunate

00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,619
and so I've been reading a lot of

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,860
self-improvement books about time

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,009
management about engineering web

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,630
development all sorts of good stuff so

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm really excited to be presenting to

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,100
you guys and of course I have a life

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,560
outside of development are you joined

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,890
yoga volleyball salsa dancing

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,390
woodworking just anything to break the

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,250
habit of eating on the computer kind of

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,799
like over like that and so do you kind

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,439
of start off the biggest thing to start

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,170
off with is your Y so as simon Sinek

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,899
say very few people or companies he

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:56,179
clearly articulate why they do what they

00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:56,869
did but why I mean your purpose cause or

00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,929
belief

00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:02,090
why does not why does your company's

00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:04,090
this why'd you get out of that every

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,399
morning and why should anyone care

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:11,209
people don't buy what you do they buy

00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:13,280
why you do it he has a famous TED talk

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:18,010
speech that you guys can go back to but

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,450
it just it really comes down to you why

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,430
when you present yourself why are you

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,579
gonna do this but what kind of care is

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:30,459
him so for me in terms of why I'm

00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:32,959
presenting I was at free banana SEO and

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:35,780
unfortunately my developer at the

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,579
time he was starting to get really

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,489
stressed out he wanted he took a

00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:43,160
two-week vacation two weeks turned into

00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:46,790
three weeks and then by the fourth week

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,030
he said I'm not coming back this isn't

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,590
for me so then I was the only one left

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,150
at the company in terms of the food

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,359
department so I work load has increased

00:02:53,150 --> 00:03:00,019
50% I had to take a little bit of

00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:02,660
projects and whatnot it's like what do

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:04,880
you do how do you do any of this and

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,690
there was you know really had to put the

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,760
time and whose gets to the test and

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:13,669
honestly I know we all have a bunch of

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,410
projects to do and everyone wants to get

00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:18,349
the most amount of things done in the

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,599
least amount of time so

00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:24,560
learned over the past multiple months

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,659
and being the sole developer they're the

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,389
first things first I would highly

00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,790
suggest be filtered emails if you have

00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:34,969
Gmail this is the link that you guys can

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:39,500
go to how to do that it's great for like

00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:42,049
your app notifications plugins WordPress

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,239
anything and you can - just trying to

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,189
silo all the different emails that you

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,749
come to come through I've seen so many

00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,340
people get them they don't do this and

00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:52,159
most of their emails are just stacked up

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,260
if it be eat meals a day you look at it

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,329
and it's tough because you just you

00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,949
still have those really important emails

00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,989
kind of tucked away with all those

00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:01,969
WordPress you know WordPress is just

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:06,139
nothing at this that you have 20 sites

00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:08,090
just got the updates like then you miss

00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:13,250
something it's just it's it's really

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:16,370
critical so one of the so my email set

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,759
up you got your identification so yes

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:22,669
slack Google project hub I have all

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,710
sorts of different things all set up in

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,699
your filters I got one for WordPress

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,580
where a fence

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:31,310
I always have I always keep my contact

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,599
forms saved on here just in case

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,370
somebody said oh how come the contact

00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:36,020
form didn't work it's like no it did

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,270
work and I'll keep that in the same

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,610
place so they'll turn out your Gmail is

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:48,080
highly critical

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:52,190
oops all right yeah another big ones for

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,630
how you format your emails big thing is

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,580
to try to get the most important words

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,400
at the beginning and at the end of your

00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,759
sentences that way people read it the

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,860
way people listen is that you want is

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,870
that the most important words are at the

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,360
beginning of the end

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,280
this sometimes you might hear people to

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,750
suggest that for reading purposes and

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,460
trying to read a book fast and just try

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,660
to read the beginning and some sentences

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,870
so a no honesty that the person who does

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,680
the best and I notice kind of local is

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,300
Donald Trump there's a big speech

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,790
there's a YouTube video that I can add

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,370
on to the slide if you ever see is just

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,199
just tweets or whatever he does it's

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,500
just wicked funny because he'll he'll

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,419
say you know he'll always kind of start

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,690
off with some sort of a capturing one

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:43,720
more things like close and then he's

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:46,540
like the the White House is closed on

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,930
this state and he always structured it

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,750
really well his house but really just as

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,389
the scene that's pretty much why his

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:59,440
campaign was such a success people were

00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:01,000
able to remember what he was saying you

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,120
know also the big ones to repeat back

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,970
what your client has said that's a very

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,960
military like style so military they

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:13,120
were say something like you know take

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,010
the Jeep bring it down to the gas

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,139
station fill it up with gasoline

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,240
call me back when that stuff and so I

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:24,430
suppose repeat back what they said okay

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,020
I'm gonna take the Jeep where you look

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,970
down to the gas station I'm gonna fill

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,370
it up with diesel now I'm gonna call you

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,590
it's like no no I'm not diesel gasoline

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,130
and so you want you always want to try

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,599
to repeat back what whatever the clients

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:43,360
a question from you that way you guys

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:46,449
can have that confirmation yeah

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,229
and so one of the things is that this is

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:52,150
a simple example of one of the kind

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:53,919
would say something like I was thinking

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,740
today that maybe we should change the

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,150
bar where the user sees the notification

00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,830
for next Tuesday

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,479
so my fines know that we're closed for

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,689
the day

00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:06,759
that is one long sentence I'm not really

00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:08,650
sure exactly what next Tuesday is we

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,879
said something about today but today has

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,009
nothing to do with the notification

00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,680
thing and it's just it's really

00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:17,590
convoluted so a better example would be

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,840
our store will be closed on Tuesday

00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,930
November 6 please update the

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,340
notification bar to reflect this change

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,629
something simple easy sentences yeah

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,699
what else you just want kind of want to

00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:33,400
be segmented like that and also

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,909
whitespace is huge and you guys can bold

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,580
things

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:41,229
italicize things just anything to make

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:47,229
it very easy for the reader for some

00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:48,909
note-taking I highly should just just so

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,349
that it's a simple task so that you can

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,690
avoid the step but as soon as you start

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:54,819
they have three or more items you brain

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:58,419
really can't handle more than three

00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,889
three things on the mind for a task so

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,440
one of the best things is to create a

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,029
list with checkboxes and so some of the

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,710
applications you can use this Evernote's

00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:09,639
google key Google Docs Microsoft Word

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,800
depends if the client sends you

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,839
something Microsoft Word I'll just I'll

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,300
just keep that and do a little check

00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,240
mark right next to each task or or do a

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,560
scratch outline however notice the

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,690
Google keeps are pretty cool they have

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,860
they have the ones with the check boxes

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:28,860
that's been pretty helpful and then

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,320
there's some note-taking examples so

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,060
before I said the devices to not repeat

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,190
yourself so you don't want to keep

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,539
saying like homepage do this on the home

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,180
page to do that on the home page home

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,490
pages like though we can try to set it

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,910
up where you have the home page and you

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,550
have the task that you want I always try

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:58,540
to have the type of past where it needs

00:08:51,550 --> 00:09:00,760
to be an update things like that and

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,980
that seems to be very helpful keep

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,800
everything together it makes everything

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:10,630
very clear it out what you need to get

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,720
done and so one of the things to do is

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:17,380
to use things that popular these things

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,640
have the most support they can get right

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,550
I think I think we've almost figured

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,170
something like yo ceci gonna plug in

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:26,320
it's like knowing that I have a great

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,630
support team you you always want

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,940
something like that if you don't have to

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,800
always do that but typically I was just

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,899
going with something that's popular and

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,699
if it's not what you're liking is like

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:41,380
you really be sure you know you're gonna

00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:43,390
be using it or for something that's very

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,730
unique to you it's typically there's a

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:52,209
lot of things online that already have

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:54,940
free tools that get argues - and another

00:09:52,209 --> 00:10:00,250
one other suggestions do something I'll

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:01,209
change your approach so was it you got

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,310
Tony Robbins here

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,980
he says frustration is a very positive

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,199
sign it means that your solution to your

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,420
problem is within range but what you're

00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:12,190
currently doing isn't working and you

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,899
need to change your approach in order to

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:19,990
change - in order to achieve your goals

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:21,010
I've counted as many times where you're

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,830
trying to

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,710
solution trying so how are you keep

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:29,050
trying the same same solutions over over

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,150
again it's like alright the solution

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,710
you're proposing isn't working you spend

00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,530
that hour on it spent two hours it's

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,730
this isn't maybe this isn't the way and

00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,140
if you start to start feeling that

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,650
frustration like how come this isn't

00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,490
working

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:45,100
take a breath take it easy rethink it

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:47,080
over is this the right approach to what

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,940
you want to accomplish or is this

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,840
something else that you might might need

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:59,050
to change your change change the way

00:10:52,840 --> 00:11:01,630
you're approaching your go there's

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,690
another cool one which is trying to get

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:07,180
into a state of flow so you go here is

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:11,140
to try to balance your competency and

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,710
the challenge so you want to do things

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:18,100
that are competent and weed so you're

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,480
doing things that are competent you can

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,210
meet to like board up give you

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,620
eventually your your confidence

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,180
something keep going keep going

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,920
eventually it's like oh you started

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,790
getting this like tiring feelings I

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,520
thought it's not it's not it's just it's

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,720
just not feeding or so basically but

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,100
then you also don't wanna do things that

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,950
are too challenging because then the

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,750
leads to stress frustration and this

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,770
feeling like I can't do this this isn't

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,600
this isn't right

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,430
so you want to try to get it into the

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,340
bounds of the two and that's where you

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,540
get this change the state of flow and

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,880
you guys probably all experienced that

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,970
at some point where your work on a

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,610
project in an hour or two maybe three go

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,470
by

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,390
you just don't know where the time song

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,850
it's because that's that perfect blend

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,230
of a challenge met with something that

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,420
you're competent in something that's

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,220
like just a let's just both your

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,760
competency there's enough challenge just

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,130
so you can kind of keep going on this

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,050
rocket ship up so you have a perfect

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,720
graph there's a YouTube video on this

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,120
little discussion right you want to try

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,340
to get enough challenge to get into the

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,680
state of flow or you don't want too much

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,680
of us or start getting anxious some

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,570
think you can do it then if you get too

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,600
used to what you do it started getting

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,560
bored so I get tired start to it's kind

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,570
of zoned out

00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,580
I'm really feeling up for the task and

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,340
the beginning the state of flow you get

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,000
an achievement ecstasy which of course

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,010
is a very good feeling so there's

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,190
something books I highly recommend one

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,410
of them is eat that frog 21 great ways

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,770
to stop procrastinating and get more

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:59,240
done in less time and one of the things

00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:02,240
is hit the same eat that frog which is

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,730
it's an old saying if you eat a live

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,060
frog in the morning it'll be the most

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,340
difficult task of the day but you have

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,410
that weird satisfaction that it was the

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,810
worst asset of the day and nothing worse

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,810
can possibly happen now

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,430
yeah now there's also the fact that

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,430
making you not a morning person

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,540
until their second pass so one sometimes

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:37,450
like alright I'm up I'm like you know

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:39,940
I'm a lot of weight feeling good take on

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,730
the biggest ass of the day alternatively

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,100
I've always worn so of this baby steps

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,589
formula that Dave Ramsey talks about

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,010
which is you've got a fourth task it's

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,630
small its achievable like a 15-minute

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,230
I'm gonna do this quick update for

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,810
somebody in after 15 minutes like I just

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,399
did my first task you starting something

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,140
build that momentum and then you go for

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,630
something harder and harder you try to

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,630
go up in that order if you build up that

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,220
momentum so it depends on the task the

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,560
events how you're feeling it depends on

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,730
a few things but those are the two big

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,640
important ones another big one is

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:22,089
something called a parlay dough Pareto's

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,920
principle it's also known as the 80/20

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:28,959
rule you hear the famous line 80% of

00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,600
your business comes with 2272 clients

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,760
another one is to 80% of your results

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,730
and we're pointing to send your actions

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,730
and just start to see that in your life

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,110
certain tasks you're doing and so the

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,350
big question is what is 20% that you do

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,760
they get you 80% of the results and

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,740
that's your homework for tonight try to

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,940
think of something that that's that you

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:56,560
do that if you can't focusing on it you

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:01,540
know what the results that you get

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,670
really cheap from it and so there's also

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,089
a few other things there's like three

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:10,149
steps to mastering one is 30 to 60

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,580
minutes in a book or magazine another

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:14,130
one it's starting to go

00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:17,240
events workshops of courses like work

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,290
camp and another one it's audio programs

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,940
think about how much you could have

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,570
learned on your commute here to work

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:27,779
camp most of this is also to audio books

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:31,140
that I highly recommend there's some

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:33,320
podcasts as well and pretty helpful and

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:37,470
another one that's not on here is that

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:41,100
they pass like Jimi Hendrix at one point

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:43,740
oh well how often do you play the guitar

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,170
on some he's like I practice 8 hours a

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,839
day so you're Jimi Hendrix you like the

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:51,839
best best efforts like why didn't even

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,279
play 8 hours days like that's why I'm

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,279
the best thing there is

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,310
cuz I played hours a day and so they

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:03,779
started to realize if you get up to I

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:06,420
believe 1,000 hours add something see

00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:09,750
the thousand or 10,000 hours you become

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,890
a master at your craft and so you start

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,769
to think about all the hours that you

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,839
spend a year I think 20 years about

00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:17,579
2,000 that working hours you do that for

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,160
five years you'll be a master of

00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:22,560
whatever you're doing so it's very

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,750
important to build up good habits that

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,750
work that five years

00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,630
another one is to guard in nurture your

00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:38,339
energy levels are you a morning person

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:40,140
or a night owl one big thing I noticed a

00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,940
lot of times people where morning people

00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,260
then they're going to the emails and

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,990
checking emails and spending all this

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,300
time on the emails is like it's not the

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,470
best use of your energies it's like

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,470
you're a morning person you can spend

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:55,320
all that energy ready to go on your

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:59,010
emails sometimes maybe those things are

00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,570
better off like later on I know that's a

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,760
little difficult for science might be

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,500
expecting your emails but if something

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,900
things like that to just keep it mind up

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,500
when are your energy levels that your

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,100
best right so there's something to

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,510
consider another book I highly recommend

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,860
is the 7 Habits of Highly Effective

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,890
People by Stephen Covey and so the 7

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,630
habits are one is to be proactive adopt

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:29,640
the perspective of responsibility for

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:31,020
your actions reactions and results I'm

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,170
just going to fly through these these

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,160
habits another number two is to begin

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,030
with the end of minds

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,630
make sure your efforts start with the

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,929
establishment of your personal

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,780
principles when you're trying to achieve

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:48,210
what are your goals life is this is the

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,740
path that you're going to go down and

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,740
what is it going to look like in the end

00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:01,170
like you you really want he's you really

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,060
want to think about your go where you

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,200
want to do for your career wise what's

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,810
going to look like in the end when you

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,720
spend all these hours on these websites

00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:12,360
doing these didn't ask number three is

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,280
to put things first we'll be talking

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,320
about this a little bit but spend your

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,660
time on things that are important not

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,820
the things that are urgent and this is

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,550
called the Eisenhower matrix after the

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,060
president will be reviewing that in a

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:29,190
second

00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:31,290
Oh always think about when when it the

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,030
approach of every interaction with the

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,760
perspective of trying to fix the system

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,800
not the person in order to find the

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,140
solution that is the best for all

00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,910
involved so you see that a lot and what

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,830
kind of things like it you if you get

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,630
something from me that I lost or vice

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,690
versa it's like though that's that's not

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,430
how this all works you try to you try to

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,910
create approaches like I'm gonna but I'm

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:58,890
saying you know maybe we're gonna have a

00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,270
relationship you're gonna get something

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,160
that you want we did something that I

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,020
want and it all works out for everybody

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,400
and so it's always good to have that

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,070
positive mindset number five is to seek

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,280
first to be on the stick under seek

00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,540
first to understand and to be understood

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,870
be people's need to be gone just

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,030
understood establish trust and

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:23,370
communicate your emotions and then

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,140
communicate the project last right you

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,140
want to be approachable you want to be

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,660
like I think it like that I almost a

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,150
politician because you know they kind of

00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,460
have that's squeezing this to them but

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,430
you want to kind of be like someone that

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,320
you can trust and a good realtor will do

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,690
that

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,630
many many people they can look up to for

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,860
that type of understand that everybody

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,200
kind of seems to connect on that

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,630
emotional basis I mean that is why how

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,370
we typically vote for politicians and

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,050
Generals that this base will have to be

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,300
trust them I will be feel about that I

00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:59,400
might know many many people who were

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,260
Republican Google Democrats and vice

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,250
versa just because of their their

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,560
affinity towards them

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:10,470
number six is synergize combined your

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,870
the first five habits or an exponential

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,970
higher-level effective and collaborative

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:18,150
daily interaction so that's all about

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,580
building up good habits as soon as you

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,200
get those habits in place you're not

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,780
going to even think about them it takes

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,910
21 days to build up I have it so you

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,590
didn't you know trying to build up that

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,450
habit things are just become really easy

00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,060
you're starting to enter that state of

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:36,120
flow kind of type of effects so it's

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:39,890
very important and number seven is to

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,660
sharpen the saw which is all about

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:45,930
maintaining your body you know

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,130
exercising eating right feeling good you

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,760
always want to try to build up that

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:52,440
energy in you and so the eyes insisted

00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,290
back to number three was about the

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,140
Eisenhower matrix so you have four

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,130
different boxes you have your first box

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,050
which is important and urgent you're

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,270
important not urgent non urgent

00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:10,410
important in that non important not

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:12,330
urgent to bring battle down you have the

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,670
first one which is supported and urgent

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,410
and this one so about like the house is

00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,660
on fire or the IRS the second be a

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,220
letter my passport is about inspiring is

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,020
like everything's was chaotic

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,820
you're freaking out you don't you don't

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,530
know what to do you're starting to get

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,880
nervous your stomach

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,130
do I have the money for this who have

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,500
this that it's like it's chaotic you

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,990
don't want to be here but it's important

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,730
you need to you know call 9-1-1 you need

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,320
to you need to figure out your letter to

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,220
the IRS you need you need to do these

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:43,020
things but you need to not be in this

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,450
box all the time call so you're gonna

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,300
start feeling chaotic life you're gonna

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,860
feel very very tired so the best thing

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,050
to do is trying to set up habits too

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,600
late oh my passports doing expiring here

00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:56,510
try to get ahead of the curve on only

00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,390
cents about paying your taxes on time

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,210
having having such a system in place for

00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,300
all these things

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:08,010
number two is important and not urgent

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,960
this is the actually the most important

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,500
box because it's all about learning a

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,630
new skill

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,060
reading a book attending work camp

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:18,110
trying to find time for things that are

00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:21,150
going to really improve your life and

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:23,070
it's typical things that you know in the

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,960
back of mind what you need to do it's

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,020
just the fact that you have made the

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,760
time for it all so do your best that's

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,220
another big homework these great guys

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,920
try to figure out what's good at number

00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,640
two box the important not urgent time

00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,100
for it number three is you're not

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,020
important but urgent these are typically

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,110
phone calls and emails and notifications

00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:49,260
and that annoying co-worker always tells

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,210
me how bad they have it you can always

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,910
try to avoid these things obviously he

00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,980
check your phone and whatnot but

00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:00,600
typically at work I'd keep my phone on

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,610
silent I'll check my phone periodically

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,980
but you know I don't need that constant

00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,559
interruption

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,630
a text messages and people kind of

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,970
stopped me from what to do rate because

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,950
then I lose that state of flow and it

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:16,790
just it kind of really upsets the system

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:20,150
and number four is you're not important

00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:22,460
and not urgent it is it kind of fighting

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:25,610
it is an important box as you do the

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:28,220
time to like relax how to be ambitious

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,460
and go together all the time but things

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,860
like social media movies video games

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:37,010
that's what some show it's like you

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,840
don't need this thing in your life at

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:43,160
least to the extent that we need happen

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:45,470
I think the average person spends three

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,070
to five hours of social media a day it's

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:52,070
like we what if you had time to do those

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,910
other things like so these are the areas

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,040
like you know

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:57,610
fair warning be careful but it's

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,890
important to hang out with friends and

00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,690
do things as well this is actually a box

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:08,900
I need to focus on a little bit more in

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:10,790
my life a little irony and so for a good

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,730
time management you really really really

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:16,640
want to be in this box the important not

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:20,000
urgent if you can master that black

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,730
shouldn't be really good and so some

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,309
WordPress specific tools and advice that

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,370
I can give you guys is the first crates

00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:31,429
of documentation in terms of initial set

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,460
up your style guide and launching a

00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:36,799
website and my old company we really

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,220
didn't do much for style guides there's

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,150
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,950
logo the sales reps would always just

00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:44,419
just trying to push the sale and so the

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,169
client wouldn't give me a lot of content

00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:51,230
but I took up a new job recently and so

00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:53,000
we have a style guide highly effective

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,280
trying to make even if it's something

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,240
small it always just something small all

00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,530
right these are the colors that we're

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,320
going to use these are the different

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:03,260
fonts it's like like any any type of

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,070
style guide to support it and then the

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:08,780
other two guides are more general or

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,140
like the initial setup that's gonna be

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,370
different for everybody I use live web

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,710
formerly known as Rackspace at my old

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:19,850
company now we're using our own internal

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:21,110
servers at Amazon so that's gonna be

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,490
different for everybody but there's

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,980
definitely a system in place that you

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:27,289
guys use definitely important to write

00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,990
it down it's great to have for what you

00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:32,690
guys hire somebody due or when you so

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,789
happen to forget a step it's always very

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,409
important and it doesn't have to be

00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:37,880
these you should always do the two

00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,640
things which is to have the

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,679
documentation and then to add it into a

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,539
checklist so that way when you go down

00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,250
down the steps you can easily check it

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:47,630
off you don't need to read the six pages

00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,110
of the documentation you just have to

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,820
read this one page of your notes and the

00:25:51,110 --> 00:26:00,309
same goes for launching a website as

00:25:52,820 --> 00:26:04,250
well all right there we go

00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:05,659
we have my Evernote's so this is my

00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,600
documentation for how to launch a

00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:10,700
website go review all the pages for

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,690
links and make sure the content is good

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:17,990
is it responsive is their father gone is

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,640
there forever page copyright a does that

00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,190
googling

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,679
and that's all under general and

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:27,610
everything's broken down but this is the

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,110
elite your unused content your contact

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:32,710
form set up the different plugins that

00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,929
use it makes everything very easy for me

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,940
to follow up you know these things

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:40,779
happen and I have a checklist in the

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,789
future for when the client says oh this

00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:44,529
stick Don said yes you know these are

00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:46,809
the things that got dying or I can

00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:48,309
double-check like an intern it's like

00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,049
coming did you check these off I didn't

00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:51,700
notice you didn't check you certainly

00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,260
talked to something to happen it's

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,330
really good so you guys can easily

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:59,289
follow up with what's going on and if

00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:01,570
you have any questions how to install

00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:03,940
certain plugins or how to set up certain

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:06,039
things you can go back to the

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,990
documentation but you're supposed to be

00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:10,120
building up habits so when you look at

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,490
this should be very easy we've got what

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,269
to do you just check it off and move on

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:18,340
the nice thing all right selecting

00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:20,559
plugins and there was a good speech

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,899
today about whether to view in-house

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:26,620
development or whether you should

00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:29,380
download a plug-in in my scenario we

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:32,440
were trying to build out sites really

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,200
really fast I typically would just have

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,909
one day to build out a website so I

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,860
would just have something that's like

00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,929
alright well time to build plugins

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,240
sounds like how about what do I do with

00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:45,190
one can sort of use so it's always use

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,769
the most popular trying to use the most

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:52,149
popular plug-in unless you have a really

00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:53,409
good reason not to and and it's really

00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:56,049
helpful because there's typically a

00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:57,639
community that can help you with these

00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:01,419
types of things so always

00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:03,429
for most downloads and then it's most

00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:06,099
typically the most Alice's and sometimes

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:07,479
I'll look at the ratings to see if

00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:09,039
there's good support stuff you always

00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:13,149
want to make sure there the plugins are

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,469
have some sort of you know so the

00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,709
frequency of terms of like with these

00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:20,559
states and updates it's like that

00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:22,179
sometimes you see things haven't been

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,019
updated in a year

00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:28,779
alright that's it's not looking so good

00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:30,729
so you can still use it but you really

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:32,859
really be aware that this plug it might

00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:36,729
not be supported anymore and try to have

00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:37,899
a better plan should that happen as I

00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:39,609
always say why I build something from

00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:42,519
scratch we can modify what somebody

00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:45,009
already has made that's been the big

00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:50,469
thing when I was angry free banana and

00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:53,950
trying to achieve and so some of the

00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:57,219
plugins that I recommend was Google kid

00:28:53,950 --> 00:29:00,789
page essentially you can duplicate pages

00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:02,739
posts public house it was really cool

00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:06,009
because you can start to build out pages

00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:08,589
really really fast trying to get

00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:10,690
something done demo content and if you

00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:12,940
already have a page setup of a sort of

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:15,749
style he already likes you just keep it

00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,749
in the duplicate button

00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:23,210
so that was one really good plug in

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,690
another one is this plugin called insert

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:29,149
pages this is pretty cool because you

00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:32,570
can build out like typically have build

00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:36,970
up footer in Nevada and I have a nice

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:40,759
like visual use a visual editor has also

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:42,350
you know parallax picture contact form

00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,989
and everything's nice and neat

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:46,700
but then we want to put it on every page

00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:50,330
we want the foot we want this like very

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,889
stylized footer on every page how do we

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,649
do this and so there's this cool plugin

00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:57,590
Oh insert pages you just insert the

00:29:54,649 --> 00:30:00,350
shortcode so I'll have a page called

00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:06,289
footer I'll insert that footer with the

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:08,059
shortcode and the WP footer template and

00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:11,419
all of a sudden I'll have this really

00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:13,759
pretty footer on all the pages and it's

00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:17,109
like weird honestly that's cool alright

00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:19,369
and then we move on to the next task

00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:23,179
another one was this better search

00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:25,009
replace essentially it only does is it

00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:29,139
replaces replaces your Texan code

00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:30,830
throughout the database some people it's

00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:34,600
difficult sometimes you get into the

00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:37,879
cPanel login it's poor great is that

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,100
skipped all that steps this plug-in does

00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:42,200
it all your place your code your phone

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,859
numbers email addresses you do it all

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,619
globally the only big thing is you need

00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:50,269
to save your database or at least

00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:56,570
understand what your gonna be changing

00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:59,600
you don't if you changed your you change

00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:02,499
your URL address be very very careful

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,669
you might end up breaking your site so

00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:09,379
before you do this

00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:11,869
and log back in to your database to try

00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:15,799
to update your your levels using this

00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:21,559
type of play that happens you guys

00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:24,710
always contact me and another one is

00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:27,499
page las' this was a cool plugin we use

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:30,230
this a lot for SEO purposes to build out

00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:33,590
of a sitemap you literally only do is

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,749
ensure the shortcode page list and it

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,350
generates a sitemap and you're done

00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:40,850
that's it that's all you need to do and

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:44,259
yeah just another quick way to get

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:47,239
things done and the least amount that

00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:48,320
and so selecting a theme I've always

00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,629
just stuck with the Bata

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,570
we kept using different themes to

00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:57,169
purchase of different things and then as

00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:59,480
you know theme options things are the

00:31:57,169 --> 00:32:03,019
places for different themes and wonders

00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,129
of where we're going where we're gonna

00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:07,460
thank you spending all this time

00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:08,269
researching and eventually I said that I

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,429
have had enough

00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:12,470
I'm sinking to the bottom of theme I'm

00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:14,720
just gonna know where everything is

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:17,590
even though this is one thing running

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,669
back and it's been extremely successful

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,989
to the point where I have built out of

00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:24,109
sight like four hours

00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:27,919
nice bye-bye paste site contact for all

00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:29,570
sorts of different things so if you get

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,379
really good at one theme know it really

00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:36,739
well develop some CSS they can implement

00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:39,799
that you typically use really trying to

00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:43,789
turn out site like good-looking sites in

00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:46,389
a short amount of time and so one of the

00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:46,389
things is

00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,970
a quick example would be one sensitive

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,590
things I want to hide things easily

00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,539
write something like this like not sent

00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,970
there touch the line cemetery to your

00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:59,260
code as soon as you have a code why you

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:04,150
want to center everything that you just

00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:05,620
insert that class name center well you

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,980
do that with like background colors as

00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:11,230
well something like BG red was on their

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,480
covers all your background colors are

00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:16,620
all red anything to just try to make the

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:20,440
process much faster or much cleaner a

00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,559
big thing I always recommend this is to

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,840
read up the bootstrap documentation

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,220
because you start taking out all sorts

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,140
of different lessons of how they

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:33,760
structure their CSS and and how how they

00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:38,380
achieve things so they'll do something

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,030
like red or primary color this back and

00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:46,750
you just started turning the classes and

00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:49,120
all set you're starting there and so I

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:51,340
have a big list all the things that use

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,360
over and over again all sorts of the

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:59,770
Bata stuff so typography things so I'll

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:03,370
have something for like it'll be like h1

00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:05,830
red H wine see it's to read all these

00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:09,580
different things just trying to get oh

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:14,320
my coloring right those sorts of things

00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:16,389
for like the contact forms and just

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,330
makes it that life really easier the

00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,230
current year for the new copyright dates

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,630
you said I realize you're going to

00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,520
repeat this is the work that you do

00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,440
like the other things that you've got so

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,580
if you're trying to save up all the

00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,680
things that you've done and make them

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,170
try to generate yourself a process

00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,750
you're becoming a lot faster a lot

00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:37,600
cleaner

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:40,060
and last but not least is to learn you

00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,680
won at once so I always recommend

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,310
everybody should learn like the one on

00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:48,820
one's about writings design development

00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:52,210
Photoshop business sales SEO just the

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:56,290
basics so like I haven't learned

00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:58,360
Photoshop I'm a little job and just oh

00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,780
you only really need to do is to be able

00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,430
to the crop images how to how to

00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,620
optimize your images how do I have a

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,950
color overlay I'll get a logo that's

00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:11,050
like black and transparent oh this is

00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,780
good but then you realize the site they

00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:15,670
want is it's also black and it's like

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,650
okay black I'm black that doesn't work

00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:19,960
out at all so to be able to go into

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,700
Photoshop and add a over way to make it

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,200
white something like that is very

00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,400
critical so that way you're not always

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,830
hanging on to good designers or the

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,620
other people at work and you start to

00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:34,630
realize like that red oaks law which is

00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,460
a 20 role that you only need to know

00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,260
like the 20% of Photoshop you don't even

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,050
know everything about it but you'll

00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:44,200
achieve 80% of the results for knowing

00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:46,420
that and so it really helps you become a

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:52,990
more self independent self efficient

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:57,300
type of developer and that's it so if

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,300
you guys have any questions let me know

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:36,400
yeah I could not like you get it up

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:36,400
there a day everything's my website

they said I know what it's like to do

00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:53,569
I said not suggesting that you guys have

00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,160
oh you know freelancers are on your own

00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:58,190
but like I know what it's like to not

00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,849
not know where to go what to do is that

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,740
so

00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,910
you know oh it's God left me always try

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,089
to at least put you guys in the right

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,089
direction

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:27,960
to make sure that we're not wasting

00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,960
power on something you thought

00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:39,010
yeah it's time you the best thing is to

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:42,040
try to keep a record of all the things

00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,050
that you've done in terms of like how

00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,880
how long does it take so that way you

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,310
can have this history of like how long

00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,980
sort of did you take let's say I had a

00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,320
contact form to your website this is

00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,390
take 30 minutes to save our trying to

00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,910
try to find that ranking to what it

00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:03,310
might take and then I always add an

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:09,010
additional 50% in terms of time wise all

00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:11,560
right this try to do like a ring so I

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,600
think it's gonna take an hour to do

00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,030
something I'll say hello it's gonna take

00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,270
an hour to two hours just just so I can

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:21,340
have that way if somebody else says what

00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,600
that are better suggestion I'm open to

00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,760
it but that's typically what I've been

00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:28,650
doing and have my new job you don't have

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,650
to do those things anymore so

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,880
well I'll do it early then they'll be

00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,410
like well some point things didn't only

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,930
show it's none of them

00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,119
what smell yeah typically we dude by the

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:12,880
hole so typically then after the story

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:20,230
about it but at the same time we do the

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:22,720
duel called harvest we have harvest is

00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:27,970
an invoice in timing tools and then into

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:31,440
graduated base camp or - well oh and

00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,440
what it does is it takes all the timer

00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:45,190
selector switch okay you can see what

00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,050
you're doing over the course of a

00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:49,720
project you can get a break down exactly

00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:52,570
where I'm at and so our clients love it

00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,430
because it sighs no employers will bill

00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:58,140
every 15 minutes you know them very

00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,140
minute increments but they get all ready

00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,370
or that's you know a bunch of you know

00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,980
pretend minute tasks I'm going to ask

00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:07,980
moment tasks and you know then we can

00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,100
and you can probably create you know

00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,020
you're doing a lot of like smallish

00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:26,230
websites you know most websites are the

00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:29,470
same overall so this website project

00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:34,000
master tasks I'm just kind of running

00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:38,290
through that back in time and say okay

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,430
it takes an hour takes two hours average

00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,430
takes three hours

00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,160
I just says the main point I always

00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,840
found it very helpful to make sure my

00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,100
clients understand that websites are

00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,410
works in progress

00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,580
they aren't done finished completed

00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:02,590
things like a brochure or a catalog yeah

00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,200
just say that you know what they see now

00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,670
they are not limited to and the website

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,730
will look different a year from now the

00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:11,710
what it does now yep and also to if I

00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,950
have the client at once you know write a

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:16,720
blog just have them write the blog in an

00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:20,260
email and sends it to me and I'll get it

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,320
posted in in WordPress don't try to make

00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:25,900
your client learn how to create posts in

00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,620
WordPress them unless they like work for

00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,660
us because I'll just get frustrated and

00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,730
have to write them if they have a blog

00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,510
with different just have them send it to

00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,660
you in an email

00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,880
I'll get up and posted in 30 seconds

00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,650
that would take them 10 minutes 40

00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,950
minutes to do it's a huge time-saver

00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:46,690
it's funny cos sometimes we'd go back

00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,670
and forth about this and I still don't

00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:53,050
know what the best solution was which

00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:55,060
was sometimes somebody really wants to

00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,310
know I'll send them a documentation like

00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:03,240
oh like here you go this is how you do

00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:05,740
this is how you do this do it yeah

00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,620
that's unfamiliar without a great post

00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,300
at work WordPress just time send you the

00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,090
blog in an email you'll get it posted

00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,680
it's more work for you but it's well

00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:18,550
worth the time yeah and it's a little

00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,260
fuzzier all right it's done the top you

00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,290

00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:26,800
images and impose some things like that

00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:28,240
do you need to be fair to banana it's

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,970
