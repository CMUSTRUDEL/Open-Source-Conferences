second time to Portland and I paid Sam

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,260
not to mention any of the shenanigans

00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:14,379
that we may or may not have done and you

00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,209
know in the past but uh these are always

00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:18,310
telling somebody at lunch today these

00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:20,710
are always hard because how do you tell

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,570
like there's several tracks here use

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,640
your track business track developer

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,400
track and so it's already always hard

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,590
but this has kind of been resonating

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,800
simmering I think in me as like Sam said

00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,719
earlier this year we we were acquired by

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,840
liquid web so the business that ran for

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,300
10 years sold and just it was kind of a

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,450
nostalgic time of just thinking back ok

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,410
what how how the heck did I end up here

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:49,030
I'm very grateful and fortunate to be

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,720
have ridden the WordPress training for a

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,149
long time and so it's kind of just

00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,980
thinking back and it just felt like it's

00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,149
obvious to my wife she was here she

00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,120
should actually give the talk because he

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,950
doesn't bet she knows me even better but

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,530
so I wanted to share what I think is my

00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,840
what I shouldn't say I think I know is

00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,490
my secret weapon for success so I'm

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,039
gonna take you back twelve years ago I

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,899
was sitting in an office in a church in

00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:15,939
Oklahoma City and that was my job I was

00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:17,109
the communication districted so I'm

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,850
telling you these things I want to

00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:20,709
contrast some stuff and then I want to

00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,109
share my secret my dirty little secret

00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:26,259
so 12 years ago I was basically like a

00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:29,229
glorified copiers guy like I was doing

00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:30,999
the bulletins for the Wednesday and the

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,369
Sunday church services and things like

00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:38,079
that and I was sitting in the barrel

00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:40,060
desk my office had to like the weird

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,349
doors you know that only I could not

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,719
locked it of course there's one behind

00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:44,770
me but the transition was really

00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,200
interesting and I had really only

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,259
managed the part-time person up to that

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,789
to that point and not for that job at

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:55,659
the job previously and the guy that was

00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:57,999
in the job that my previous job that

00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,380
I've managed basically was a grad

00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:01,749
student that could have done the job

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,340
that basically trained me so to say I

00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:04,679
managed the part-time person was

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:11,590
probably a little bit of a stretch too

00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:12,850
so then then 2008 like Sam said by the

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,890
way when I was sitting in that office

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,780
and everything at night I was blogging

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,290
with

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,770
WordPress and I start with blogger

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,980
quickly found this thing called

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,870
WordPress and put myself out there

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,870
my idea is to be potentially criticized

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,670
but also save my people and for a long

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,959
time a brag that my one subscriber was

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,590
my mom and eventually that built into

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,660
things and then I put a free theme out

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,370
because I wanted to learn web design I'm

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,330
not a developer by the way they'll try

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:49,050
to even pose for one on TV but so in

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:52,590
2008 pitch to my two partners the idea

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:56,670
for what would be AI things but you know

00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:01,620
this so so the ten year journey from

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:03,570
2008 to 2018 culminating with being

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,160
acquired by liquid web like Sam said I'm

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,340
still running

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm still running our team within a

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,810
bigger 500 person hosting company so my

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,230
title has changed a little bit huh oh

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,360
I'm sorry

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,140
but somebody said something I know I

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,940
need hearing aids so anyway um but you

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,580
know just looking over that ten-year

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,150
period of time where today we have about

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,090
20 people we have seven people in seven

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,250
US states four countries and two

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,280
comments and I like somehow I went from

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,720
this little copier guy glorified country

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,970
I did a lot more with a desktop

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,910
publishing but I made copies of those

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,340
things and then to the incredible ride

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,980
that I'm thankful we had and I things

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,530
where we built great products talking to

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,269
some customers at lunch actually and it

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,299
was a fun time but when I look back I go

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,940
how did I get from here to there and by

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,890
the way I'm I'm this kid from a town

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,780
called lone Grove Oklahoma it's in

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,959
southern Oklahoma there's 3,000 people

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,640
in the town and there is one sonic like

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,079
there's a sonic we have a sonic drive-in

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,700
in lungo and one stop line so how you

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,859
know I kind of picture myself sometimes

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,109
going how did that do all this so I want

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,260
to share with you my secret Wieck weapon

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:24,000
okay of when I look back and I go this

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,919
way there's a lot of ingredients that

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,580
went into success collaboration of a

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,199
talented talented team

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,669
really good relationships with people

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,069
and things like that well I think how

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,990
did I go from this to start managing

00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,750
people to building what I think is a

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,470
really good culture at our at I themes

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,669
that people want to work at I themes

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,949
here it is now this is the grand finale

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:49,900
and I tell somebody this last night and

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:52,220
kind of like oh that's what you're gonna

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,960
well now I'm gonna have to actually come

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,120
and listen to your tongue I said it's

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,949
probably might probably unpack it a

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,380
little bit better tomorrow but anyway I

00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:05,120
read but I don't just read so I've read

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,470
not just going back 12 years but my

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,479
entire life I remember going to the

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,919
Chickasaw library in Ardmore which is

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,620
the bigger town you know there's a small

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,240
town the bigger town and just grazing

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,360
the aisles of the library sounds like

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,680
this this is like all this knowledge and

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,360
everything put in these cool little

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,840
forms called books but I've always read

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,520
very voraciously and but I really I've

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,110
read strategically so that's what I want

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,259
to kind of impact for you how I've read

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,150
how I've leveled up and done things that

00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,699
honestly I wasn't trained to do but I've

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,919
went probably by problem situation by

00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:42,530
situation gap by gap every gap that I

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,409
had I'd go acquire it find the right

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,659
book and read it and I want to change I

00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:50,389
want to share that with you exactly so

00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:51,680
reading has definitely reading in a

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,110
different way reading strategically

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
that's the way I read has changed my

00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,639
life it's making me money

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,940
you know I when we were thinking about

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,069
the potential deal from hiring our first

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:07,490
person I went and found books that would

00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:09,979
would help me educate me and become a

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,779
more confident person or creative person

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,159
innovative what I'm trying to tell you

00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,889
is I'm not that smart to do all this

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:18,650
stuff I had to go find what people that

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:22,370
would help me do it but also to become a

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:25,759
better dad better father husband and I

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,139
think human so okay last couple months

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,740
this has kind of been simmering so I

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:33,560
went back to Amazon and licked and this

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,070
if my wife sees the statistic she can

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,930
really be mad at me but like I realize

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,080
just from when I could get my Kindle

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,629
purchases

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,910
on Amazon it must be came out in like

00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,830
2010 or 2011 or whatever last eight

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,960
years I was like eight hundred books

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,840
holy cow now let me give you a caveat

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,110
I've not read cover to cover all those

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,639
books but what's so interesting is the

00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,560
trail when I started looking through

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,449
this list I had to copy and paste into a

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,509
spreadsheet and try to look through them

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:08,020
and I go I could see seasons of times in

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:09,849
my life where I bought this collection

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,009
of book just on the purchase situation

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:14,610
kind of interesting if you do the math

00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:19,710
which my wife has recently this year

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:23,319
it's a small fortune in books and but

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,090
the beauty is I carried around with me

00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,310
like all of those books I carried around

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,909
have access on the phone I'm gonna talk

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,110
to you about that in just a second so

00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:33,280
books for magic now you guys are

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,750
probably readers you're here you're

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,479
learners and things like that but I

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,030
think books are magic because in a $20

00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,889
little package roughly $20 mil packets

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,629
someone who has spent years and years

00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:47,710
and years experience and expertise all

00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:51,550
that has been forced to put all of that

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,960
in a very clear succinct manner so I

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,300
think they're I think they're pretty

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,360
magic and then I get to carry it around

00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,509
in my pocket now but my lab my library

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,550
has been my board of directors my

00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,659
council of elders my taters and teachers

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,279
all these years now I've had a lot of

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:14,219
help in person health but dead trees are

00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:16,900
a big part of my success so I think

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:18,400
reading and reading this specific way

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,169
has definitely helped me and I'm gonna

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,840
share some examples of how specifically

00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:25,330
when there's moments of the gaps

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,789
realizing like I'd not really managed

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,340
any person and then all said in the

00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:32,110
first year we had four people how those

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,690
things really helped me but I honestly

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,279
believe best investments and by the way

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,680
so thinking about next chapter in my

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,740
life what am i doing I'm reading I

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,829
actually did pick up a print copy of a

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,020
book on purpose and meaning from HTR at

00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:50,020
the at the airport because I didn't want

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,490
to drain my iPhone battery so I mean

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,840
just thinking about next steps I'm still

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,340
doing that best invent best invest

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,570
ever so I read to get an edge I read now

00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,240
these are my dirty little stickers by

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:06,820
the way because I I have met people that

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,500
can out hustle me way smarter than me

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,230
actually have really good original ideas

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,320
and I knew I had to find an edge

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,450
somewhere so to get ahead stay ahead to

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,430
level up mind the gaps every every big

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,680
major event around I themes I was

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:26,660
looking in books and then taking those

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,600
ideas and inspiration to use in our

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,400
business and in my personal life so this

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,589
is the key read for inspiration and

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,180
ideas but there are the cheat codes so I

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,690
started thinking through like all the

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:44,000
books I read or have read strategically

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,260
not comfortable by the way these are

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,450
these are the things that I've gotten

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,610
from them I mean courage is on there so

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,070
reading stories of how someone else did

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,529
something but the templates perspectives

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,480
formulas models processes I have a

00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:59,030
surgically extracted those from books

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,120
over the years you know when we were

00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:04,490
thinking about new products strategies

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,030
for being a very small team and

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,770
outnumbered and out moneyed whatever

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,270
that phrase would be having more money

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,040
than what we did I went to books and

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,260
trying to find okay is there a case

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,360
study for some you know David versus

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,540
Goliath kind of thing is there some

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,420
model of thinking strategically that you

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,490
know in my limited creativity so these

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,390
are mighty Coates books or mighty codes

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,550
and we give you some examples so 2008 by

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,880
the end of the year we had four people

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:37,310
and I had never managed anybody so these

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,860
two books I mean in the third that I'll

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,570
mention in just a second are how really

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,730
the cheat codes for how I have

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,680
approached our building our team

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,750
recruiting people maintaining the

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,850
fantastic culture that people want to be

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,820
there and then also do their best work

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,200
so 12 elements of great managers by the

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,670
way these two books I'm currently

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,100
there's two people on our team on the

00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,360
planet coaching and I'm having them go

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,400
through these books because they were so

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,500
instrumental I was looking back because

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,470
I haven't reread those books in a while

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,480
I was looking

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,520
content ago yep this is basically the

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,020
blueprint or thing we've done one of the

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,370
chapters in the great managers book

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,340
which by the way is based on Gallup

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,370
research was have a best friend at work

00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,320
I was like duh and the happiest times

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,500
I've had is when I've had really good

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,450
friends so you know we did not everybody

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,590
on the team is best friends maybe not

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,450
everybody likes each other at every

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,820
moment but we at least enjoy each other

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,910
and so I'll give you an example police

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,770
is one of our awesome team members she's

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,540
been with me for I think it's six years

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,880
now I've done it great we were looking

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,380
for a new person to couple years ago but

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,380
she goes well my best friend Sarah

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,860
listen talk to Sarah and Sarah has an

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,680
MBA and now she's doing a great role but

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,420
they they literally are best friends and

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,710
not work together but I took some of

00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:01,200
those elements of these things another

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:02,940
thing was I think second chapter is make

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,880
sure this is obvious stuff right

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,850
but I think it it's good stuff for me

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,370
but it was if make sure your team has

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,920
the right tools and equipment you're

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,650
like yeah I mean how can you not do your

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,150
work but I found out one of our

00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,380
developers for like three months when he

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,850
first started it didn't have an external

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,750
longer hey I'll get you a monitor I want

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,220
to make sure you have all the right

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,560
tools anyway that stuff came from here

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,180
leadership challenges one is modeled

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,650
away inspired by shared vision as I've

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,030
been kind of coaching and walking

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,520
through some of our team members of that

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,080
I'm going this is this is just copy and

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,290
paste what I've been doing for ten years

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,630
so that one's good how to empower others

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,370
have you anybody read this book yeah

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,640
okay well I'm sharing something new okay

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,050
it's called drive by Daniel pink

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,150
basically the premise is this autonomy

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,860
mastery and purpose that's what we want

00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,660
right think about your job you want

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,390
autonomy you want the freedom to like do

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,120
your best to pick you you know to pick

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,950
the things that you do do well master

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,170
you want to master what you're doing and

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,300
then purpose you want it to connect to

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,560
something like helping people those

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,510
three themes are the things that we just

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,630
do have done it I themes in it

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,750
I took the cheat code right I had to go

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,970
now

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,370
how do we do that because then we get

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,680
gay people way too much time and maybe

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,360
sound took advantage of ok well it's

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,960
having me with guardrails you know on it

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,160
so anyway the culture and the team and

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,390
the great things that we've done over

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,270
ten years has been shaped by those

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,250
thirty books okay so how to how to think

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,420
better or less okay you know sometimes

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,970
the machine up here doesn't work the

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,890
best that's a fantastic book how to

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,550
think through things I used that when we

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,320
were trying to plot big strategic moves

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:50,200
think through you know new initiatives

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,090
stay competitive in the game this is a

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,280
great one how to be okay saying no

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:57,640
basically if you're like me you're

00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:00,370
probably like you know not a lot of

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,870
boundaries fantastic book it gave me the

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,030
freedom and confidence to say no to

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,510
people and and still feel like I was a

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,630
good person

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,430
okay so here's another one navigating

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,190
midlife I'm 42 now but a couple years

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,830
ago I was like it wasn't necessarily a

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,770
crisis but it was brené Brown calls it

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,930
done and then I'm unraveling and I was

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,070
like yeah I was unraveling so you look

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,060
at my purchase listen you go okay I

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,970
found these two books and they were

00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,010
incredible help me have some I don't

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,520
know I can't hire those people you know

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,870
what I mean

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,000
I can't get in front of them but I can

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:35,050
go take their wisdom distill down into a

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,730
book and do that so I said my purchase

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,740
history is like a trail of my life and

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,530
it really has just going back like in

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,320
2010 or whatever from that just a Kindle

00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,490
side of things I was like I know exactly

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,930
what I was going through you during

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,210
these periods of times because they were

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,820
I was just going to book my book trying

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:54,670
to navigate with myself to these periods

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,650
of time so okay let me give you here's

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,510
my keys this is where I want to drill

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:04,720
down next to be really as practical as I

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:06,280
can in X amount of time okay so the

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,120
first is some of you gonna fight me on

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,620
this but I had to ditch you know it's

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,900
been about eight years but I finally did

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,510
my whole needed all I love the philip

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,700
taper fame in the book in front of my

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:22,500
face it's into the copy should have me

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,500
like I read you know

00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,900
I finally had to get over that little

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,910
thing now every now and then it's cool

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:37,320
to have like Harvard but anyway the

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:39,900
Kindle is the best tool ever for reading

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,870
like this if you don't and I'm not

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,490
talking by the way the Kindle is not

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,980
just the physical device you can buy on

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:50,100
Amazon it is basically the Kindle is a

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,540
reading platform and it is a ways to go

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,550
I wish amy was all like call me and I

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:58,830
would help with some stuff but like but

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,600
the Kindle it you've got reading apps

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,030
where like I said you can take your

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,290
entire library here on your phone you

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,970
know we used to go on vacation I'm

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,710
taking like three books and it's like do

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,870
you have underwear Cory in your suitcase

00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,190
something is very heavy with books but

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,900
did you know forget some of the

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:17,640
essentials now I get to take them on

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:19,170
with my book but my iPhone but I would

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,940
say if you're really serious if you get

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,980
serious about this this is the only way

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,210
to go because you can make highlights

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,810
you can store it all on your reading

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:30,870
platform it's access its convenience its

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,270
efficiency it's cool to read a book and

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,160
then tab you know tab over the thing or

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,810
highlight it but when you want to go

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,250
back and try to find some cool quote

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,170
that you you want to share with somebody

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,510
or you're trying to remember something

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,000
it's kind of hard to like oh man that's

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,560
at my library and you know my bookshelf

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,860
at the office and I really need it right

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,570
now

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,170
now I can search those things on the

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:54,660
Kindle so I mean if you really love the

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,790
print stuff Seth Godin says buy the

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,680
souvenir papi so the books that really

00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,970
resonate with me I go buy the print book

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,880
you put it on the shelf sounded cool

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,470
whenever it comes into my office and can

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,590
also point and learn them out too but

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:10,440
the Kindle that's the way to do it so I

00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,840
don't read books I use them and there's

00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,520
some key things here I think that we

00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,890
there's there's a way to approach

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,000
reading that is casual and fun and

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,950
entertainment that's not what I'm

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,470
talking about here I don't just read

00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:26,160
books I used those books as tools for my

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:29,730
life so I read for me and it's the if

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,800
this in that statement so if I'm in this

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,690
situation and I'm starting to catalogue

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,070
all my books and go here's how what it

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,090
resonates when I say the trip will not

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,070
tell you about Drive

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,200
but Dr Tana mainmast repurposed kind of

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:45,210
thing trying to categorize that by going

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,909
okay if this situation then that book

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,470
and come up with some of those but I

00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:50,760
think you have to be clear obviously as

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,650
you're reading strategically you got to

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,840
get clear on what you're looking for and

00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:58,440
specifically its the gaps challenges

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,960
problems in situations so I approach

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,539
every book on it like the book I bought

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,880
at the airport I was like that's an area

00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:09,720
a gap that I want to kind of strengthen

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:14,070
what I do to have confidence and so in

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:17,460
my head I make sure that that book

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:20,669
somehow fills in helps me with

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,070
confidence information for action to

00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:24,059
figure out one of those things but you

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,500
got to be clear on what you're looking

00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,480
for and there's still there's sometimes

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,120
some book um there's a book I'll find

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,510
and I'm like it's a cool book and I'll

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,159
buy it

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,210
but it goes in the bookshelf it goes in

00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,950
the Kindle you know I don't read it

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,510
instantly but I know it's simple and

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,130
I'll probably come back to it so anyway

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,559
clear on what you're looking for but if

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,899
you really distill it down this manner

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,279
how I read is I read for confidence you

00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:47,159
know somebody said why do people ask

00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,690
advice ask others for advice it's

00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,260
because you lack confidence on what

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,510
you're doing

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,480
I like confidence in all the areas of

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,279
those 800 books that I bought and I use

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,960
those books to have more confidence

00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,450
about what I was doing specifically

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,110
applied to ideas and inspiration right

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,820
ideas for how to attack that problem

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,559
inspiration for more creative innovative

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,309
things that I can do in the business in

00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:13,140
my life okay this is something everybody

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,600
gets held up because when I tell people

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,890
I go well just 800 you know books on

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,500
Kindle they're like you read all those

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,000
no I don't read all those because I

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,730
don't insist on reading cover to cover

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,350
so now I think maybe in our education

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,809
process or system or something that we

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,909
have to go I have not read the book if I

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:31,440
hadn't read all the acknowledgments and

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:34,559
gotten all the way through the appendix

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,360
to the last period boom got it I think

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,549
that's that's that's okay but that's a

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,080
different kind of reading so don't

00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:41,580
insist on reading cover to cover so I

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,080
think it's the biggest mistake we make I

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:48,419
read like a surgeon I'm going to dissect

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,230
define isolate extract dissect those

00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,240
Chico's

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,100
right so often in the Kindle there's a

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,309
part of our highlights thing and that's

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,350
where hundreds perhaps of people have

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:00,210
gone on this is why the Kindle is the

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,340
best today maybe that changes in a year

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,520
from there right now I can go into any

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,200
book and see where people have read the

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,750
book so there it's kind of like you know

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,919
if you did this in college ideas we've

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,540
got the used books you want the

00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,460
highlighted part you get that with

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,610
Kindle

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,380
yeah gorgeous come on

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,880
only the people that did the highlights

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,700
want the first round is anything no no

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,990
no I'm like no there's people have

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,299
highlighted that I think it's great but

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,690
Kindle has that so I read for precision

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:33,179
extraction on a focused mission now so

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,620
when you're looking at but and and on

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,919
Amazon you guys from familiar with how

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:41,010
Amazon works most every book has a look

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,380
inside feature so the table of contents

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,320
is the map to all of the gold all the

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,169
cheat the cheat codes now I get really

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,910
frustrated because when I think a book

00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:53,160
is like gonna help me with some gap

00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,169
challenge need problem and I get to the

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,450
table contents and they're really cute

00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:58,350
they're like you know life is like a

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,620
fluffy bunny

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,390
and I'm like no tell me exactly where I

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,890
can find it cuz it's my map so if they

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,650
try to be keep seeing stuff I get kind

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,320
of frustrated I had this all but I got a

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,330
book last week and I'm blanking on it

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,760
emotional agility no way

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,410
no it's called 18 minutes and I was like

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,400
gosh dangit this guy he's trying to be

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,990
fluffy and everything and I just

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,490
realized right underneath was the the

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,059
one I'm looking for in the table of

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:26,130
contents and so now I'm like ignore the

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,870
fluffy bunny description and go down to

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,929
you like the right juice but this this

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,450
is where everything the map of the gold

00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,160
is now even more extended map is the

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,799
introduction and usually on Kindle you

00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,510
can you can download the book and read

00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:41,370
the introduction if they've done their

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,940
job right and I have been through the

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:48,330
commercial book author process before

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,380
they have been forced to really and I'm

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,880
talking about non-fiction books here

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,650
right but they have enforced an

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,470
introduction to really unpack even

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,380
further the map of the book so you can

00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,790
actually get really good context for the

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,160
table of contents in the introduction

00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:06,070
but that's you know they say don't judge

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,470
by its cover absolutely judge a book by

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,120
its table of contents and if you need

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,490
further proof go into the introduction

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,130
if that didn't sell you it's not worth

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,480
20 bucks often nine times out of ten

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,950
it's not worth it if they haven't done

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:24,310
their work on the table contents in the

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:25,480
introduction so here's the critical part

00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,860
you can get all the way through here

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,900
table of contents get the right books

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,660
with the right situations in mind and

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,790
you can forget or not forget or just

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,660
leave off the fact that you're not

00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:38,620
translating transferring what you're

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,220
reading into action so reading

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,780
strategically the way I've read is I

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,400
people go why are you so compelled to

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,470
you know read as much as you do this

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,660
because I'm looking for ideas and

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,820
inspiration to apply in my life like a

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,110
scientist like in a lab like the

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,980
business has been allowed for ten years

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:59,830
in my life how how do I translate these

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,450
ideas into specific action small little

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,190
experiments that you test and see how

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,730
the work and functioning results that

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,650
you get it's by asking the question how

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,750
can I use this tomorrow like I'm always

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,880
easily I'm at night you know reading in

00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,980
bed or something I'm like huh okay how

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,440
can I apply that in the situation but my

00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,500
book I've done that so you got to have

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,780
your journal handy so I use a journal

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,050
app called day one I really like it so

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,740
I'm making all my phone typically and

00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:32,740
then I'll copy it copy some quote idea

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,260
thought I switch over to my day one app

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,790
so I can capture those I think this girl

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,350
you can do it however you want but this

00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,060
is the way I happen to do it cuz I want

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,690
everything electronic record search out

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:48,010
remember some kind of quote okay so I

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:49,990
try to distill the the key ideas now you

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,030
know my dirty little secret of success

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,730
I'm really not that good I just read a

00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,960
lot and I find the cheat codes you guys

00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,640
know what the cheat codes are right you

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,550
back to the Nintendo days and or the

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,620
gaming days that's all I'm doing I'm

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:05,950
just a small-town kid still reading

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:10,860
finding buying cheat codes so go read

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:14,050
your way to success that's me thanks

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,050
[Applause]

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:45,320
oh yeah any moment I have free time any

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,150
any moment so now I wouldn't try to read

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,510
because I'm I wanted direct with people

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,610
here but you know I'm on the plane

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,970
unless I have a headache or just worn

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:59,080
out I try to find anytime possible for

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:01,370
me so I don't know if I have a specific

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,309
time that works best for me and maybe

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:06,080
it's you know person specific that's why

00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,400
I like taking my library on the phone

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,080
because you're in the date you're

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,660
waiting on the dentist right you're

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,400
gonna do something and it's redeeming

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,799
the time it's making use of the time and

00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,030
so I'm always just gotta find the cheek

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,700
oh it's got a thumb cheat codes kind of

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:22,030
thing so that's a good question I hadn't

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,030
thought about that

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,830
yes yes because this is totally

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,870
different purpose right one is we want

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,750
to be careful of the stream screen

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:49,179
counting stuff but like we do want them

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,010
to have that so yes they have and this

00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:52,450
is my wife no maybe I can't take your

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,880
head of work I got hundreds of books

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:58,029
you're on the house they read books but

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,980
I yeah definitely we so we're starting

00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:03,460
some transitions I've got five year old

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,380
in three year old but it's reading as

00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,409
part of their life I think you know I

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,419
want to transfer that skill and at the

00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:14,440
appropriate time if the Kindle still the

00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:16,169
best I'll be like really the kid or get

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,230
the kingdom version yeah

00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:21,519
yes it you do are you okay so this is a

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,799
great I think there are different

00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,870
learning styles that's not that's not my

00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:28,480
particular lifestyle but I know a lot of

00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:31,360
people that love audible I think that's

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,059
absolutely fantastic I do very

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,049
specifically for audible when it's more

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:39,669
parable but and it's better for me and

00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:41,950
that's just the way I'm wired I still

00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:44,139
think if I should put this on here if

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,120
not candle an audible or audio is the

00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:48,490
way you've learned then go that route I

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,090
just think it's harder to catch notes

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:56,409
but that's do readings strategically how

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:57,760
you I think learning I tried to I was

00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:59,350
taking I was doing a commune up to

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:05,769
Kansas City when I was in graduate

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:08,019
school and if you never see us Lewis so

00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:11,409
I was listening ceaseless and dang near

00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:13,260
true fell asleep and drove off like no

00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:21,570
more audiobooks

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:21,570
this is incredibly track yeah yeah yeah

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,470
good question yes so you mentioned

00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,650
growing small team to managing large

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:39,840
game or so much you read how much that's

00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:43,200
influenced your management style

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,030
do you ever recommend a series of books

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,280
or maybe a snippet of quotes or

00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:51,270
something for your team that you find

00:27:47,280 --> 00:28:06,930
helps build a janitor synergy

00:27:51,270 --> 00:28:09,150
well first generally speaking we

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,890
actually did that we we loaded up a

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,360
physical the heart of the divide we

00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,980
bought a couple of Kindles and getting

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:19,350
the people free by the way I'm sorry I'm

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,330
not answering your question but find a

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,270
way where somebody else finances your

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,760
books so for the last ten years

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:33,410
business is finance my book impart don't

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,410
tell my partner's but okay thank you

00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,900
really kind of brings it together or is

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,280
that like kind of there's probably a set

00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,320
of books that I would recommend that

00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,200
anybody and I had recommended to the

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,370
team good one that wasn't on this but it

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,250
would be on women that finally get my

00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:00,610
catalog going is on writing well Bob

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,530
Williams isn't that one I would

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:07,150
recommend to anybody in half to my team

00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:16,030
because I'm writing well yeah it's like

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:21,900
in the 25th and I have a kid to book

00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:21,900
list on my personal website good to see

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,000
so generally yes I think recently I've

00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,610
been more specific seeing where they may

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,930
need to level up or something like I'm

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,850
trying to prepare the queue Ken boomers

00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,980
we have right now of course I think the

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,910
leadership management opportunities so

00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,800
there's a challenge and great elements

00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,880
of great managers to we're going through

00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,880
week by week with each other

00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:56,470
it's mealtime pushing it's just more

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,880
common so my company we have a book and

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:02,660
would like took an hour in the morning

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,570
every month to discuss book we've all

00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:08,510
agreed to be together usually someone's

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:10,750
leading the discussion but we typically

00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:13,760
don't read my business books it's

00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,500
actually more efficient and yeah if

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:20,150
we've always kind of wanted to read it I

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:21,980
guess my thought is that there's some in

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,510
the process of sort of thinking about

00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,790
what you're reading and being critical

00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:34,400
the kind of growth of sort of critical

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:36,230
thinking skills or yeah so that's like

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:42,020
but but it's interesting that I've never

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:46,580
even thought to read some of these yeah

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:49,220
when we hired our first second executive

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:56,180
assistant we did math my right-hand guy

00:30:49,220 --> 00:31:01,240
took Patti through how to be a bad a for

00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:03,500
the recording okay you got it about a

00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,360
executive assistant and they went book

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,490
or chapter by chapter each week and it

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,120
was really foundational right so we have

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,480
a book club

00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:14,330
- looking slack you know and it's like

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,250
that the team is reading all kinds of

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,730
stuff all the time and some of it is out

00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,500
of my reach strategically category I say

00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,290
every once every three years I read

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,910
fiction and my wife we went on vacation

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,490
a couple weeks ago and she was like did

00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:31,100
you buy a fiction book in print and what

00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,750
no and I know why she's saying that she

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,370
says because I'll get hooked and

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,140
obsessed on the fiction book and if I do

00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,400
it on print I don't have that Kindle

00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,200
where I can switch back and forth and go

00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,290
this I want to get something else so

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,530
every three years like after Harry

00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,530
