Title: Pratik Ghela: Our 6 months journey around AMP, WordPress and AMP Stories
Publication date: 2019-04-13
Playlist: WordCamp Portland ME 2018
Description: 
	Google AMP was announced in 2015 and has been in the headlines for past few years. Many developers find it pretty difficult to adapt this latest technology. Pratik aims to make it simple and easy to understand Google AMP and will walk you through his journey where he and his team built a website using Native AMP and now developing a product that helps you build AMP Stories.

[Music]

00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,670
[Music]

00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,270
so

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,650
you see that it comes up very quickly

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,229
and the content notes very far so same

00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,950
as with Apple news so Google came up

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:34,040
with this concept of EMP and initially

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:45,950
it was published only for publisher but

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:50,390
then to who gives this and so this

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:52,759
Facebook and Apple where muse ventures

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,190
supported wire here so you need to open

00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,710
the Apple music for this you need to

00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,619
open the Facebook instant articles and

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:03,560
that's exactly where Google wanted to

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:06,740
change from Safari tools to open that

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:12,019
and that stuff came into picture with

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:14,120
Google and focuses on their ultimate aim

00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:15,650
is to load the page within one second

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,470
and how do they do that

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:22,280
yes one second looks very much too

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,670
promising

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,590
but how do they deliver as Google caches

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,150
each and every page that you have in

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:34,160
their own cache so when you go to Google

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,290
website pages are not served from you so

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,370
but they have that delivered from the

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,959
Google cache so and there are about 20

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,630
pages that are being cached

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,489
every second on the Google app cache so

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,489
that's how Google just price

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:58,420
so if you see this this is a small

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,099
[Music]

00:03:22,300 --> 00:04:11,630
because and so if you see this this

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,170
website this is a website and we just

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,630
got an this here and you can see that

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,700
we've got a spoon lightning bolt so if

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,550
even if you see in the search engine

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,610
rankings Google says that it does not

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,100
prioritize and pages but it's kind of

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:32,260
trying to show people that with this

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,260
lightning bolt that this particular you

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:41,640
so so Germany developer clients and

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,070
present managers I think everyone needs

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,020
to understand very well because this

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,360
suite people don't get along with each

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,600
other the project where it is kind of

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,690
father's trying to bring it up for a

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,660
specific point on the same page and each

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,580
track record these days are very smart

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,990
so they try to come up with their own

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,530
notion of every technology so that's

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:10,590
justice right that I'm from them

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:12,780
another thing that you see these days as

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:16,620
Google this point to push ramp in

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:20,160
certain way so this is website called I

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,260
think with google.com and if you go

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,580
there and you see best website but I

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,640
think with google.com

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,800
and you put in all your site so it

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,370
checks your website on a 3G connection

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,980
and then once the site loads and if it's

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,660
not loading under three seconds it gives

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,230
you all the things that you need to do

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:44,130
and then it says fry accelerated mobile

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:46,470
pages now the funny thing is that this

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,350
website that I am checking it's already

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:54,000
built on ALP and it's still telling me

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:57,120
to build using ALP so who is like a use

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,340
EMP it's like I'm not telling you but if

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,730
you use it it's good for you so here is

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,340
valve and finally actually one second

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,940
okay so if you are doing building

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,240
websites and you are using

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,520
and yes and all those things Google does

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,060
what what normally happens is that all

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,250
the JavaScript and everything is loaded

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,140
right on the web check so Google uses a

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,780
synchronous JavaScript so it does not

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:28,630
load your JavaScript Facebook it loads

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,610
that after your dog is loaded another

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,100
thing it is that they took the

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,010
discourage usage of any third-party Jets

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,950
so if you're using ELP you cannot use

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:41,140
cheap way of wheelchairs or any other

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,350
third party cheers to my growing with

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,370
and if you do that the Google is going

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,830
to America

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,100
I'll be patient another thing is that

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:54,070
all the CSS that you write you cannot

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,130
make its own only if you write the CSS

00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:59,940
we use a link attribute and we linked

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:04,330
the CSS that's not something you do and

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:06,580
in you use it on the style space

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,750
ampersand when you write all your CSS

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,250
where is it textile and custom tag and

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:18,280
there is a restriction on the sides if

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:21,250
it needs to be under fifty eight so now

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,580
when you are using Google and there are

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:28,060
two versions the subversion and the ALP

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:31,240
version so this was how it was their

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,370
condition so your website page is going

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,840
to have two different versions and say

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:41,530
normal normal HTML that is the position

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,540
of your page and within the there is the

00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,330
header tag you have to write this thing

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,570
called relation

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:52,150
so what humor it does it goes to your

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:55,000
page and finds of what the and version

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,650
of your page and it will go in system so

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,260
this is how you need to do cannot be

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:06,520
particularly information so if if you

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,950
want to very game here Google + page you

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,860
need to go to validator and projector

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,250
Kawachi and you need to put your link

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,250
over there

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,390
so you're gonna box yeah

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:53,269
so so this obviously was pressure on top

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:55,610
is not an MP so this is a normal page so

00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:59,110
you need to go to this URL validator and

00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,110
when you get here you are

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:08,510
so once you have validated you will have

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,070
the tracking code symbol that are shown

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,720
in the so so these are the restrictions

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,120
that you have so you cannot use any

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,579
third-party like integers get worried

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,860
you cannot have all those fences sliders

00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:24,950
arousal image creditors except for that

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:29,269
you have so you cannot link any third

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:32,690
penny CSS external CSS and all the CSS

00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:35,000
they try to finish under 50 kV another

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,519
thing that all the developers we do is

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,380
we write important tag you cannot have

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,270
important in your CSS

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:47,209
you cannot embed myself directly then so

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,670
you cannot use carpet from plugins like

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:52,160
under from 7 gravity forms and all those

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,500
things out of the stands that we are

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,050
used to writing the IMG tag video a ice

00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,339
cream you cannot just write it directly

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:03,529
instead you have to use its own HTML

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,870
that's called M PI ng ends video my

00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:07,579
friend and if you want to check out

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,839
check out this website called and

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,839
projector to Archie

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,190
and then you can you go to reference

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,940
components and there you can see all the

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:25,820
HTML that you can even use so there is

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,589
this so this so one thing that you need

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,410
to understand is that if you are using

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:32,720
em there is a whole new learning curve

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,910
attached to it because it's like you

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,610
cannot use your muggle HTML so where you

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,850
you have been using all these years and

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:45,110
has like the proprietary and - for

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:47,389
everything like image videos I French so

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,600
you need to go through this whole thing

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:52,519
and you have pretty very documented so

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,959
you can just go through and projector

00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,959
Kawachi when you fire

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,630
but there's still certain misconceptions

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,820
about a people think that and this early

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,769
for mobile web well it's not the case

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,959
because if you see the amp projector

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:42,820
towashie website its built using an HTML

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:45,010
do it because their technology people to

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,260
forget effective looking website just

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,310
for the kids because if you see amps on

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,959
website it's pure then move restricts

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,089
your layout and design capabilities

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,510
that's not too thin you can design any

00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:06,600
kind of action that you want using here

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:09,940
then people think that people think that

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,100
because because and does not want you we

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,220
use jQuery corral so the spiders so

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,750
people think that your website cannot be

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,060
interactive but that's not the thing

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,100
because now these days you've got CSS

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,579
viral CSS carafe so this accordion

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:27,100
everything is in CSS so we've been using

00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:29,740
jQuery I don't know for the wrong

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,750
reasons that is what we but we started

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,699
reading ham to a good thing that you can

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,339
do that within using CSS because that's

00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:38,050
the power CSS is as in itself and then

00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,570
people think that you need to make it

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,240
too

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:44,720
what is the ampere second one is another

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,570
subset so that's not the thing if you

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,970
use media and you can just use one

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,040
website for both the non-death version

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,650
so that's so with net event there is no

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,210
bond opponent it's just we have version

00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:00,260
of your project that's the other thing

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:03,790
that you have so now let's start to how

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:08,330
do you amplify your WordPress version

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:11,450
using plugins now I will do that so

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:15,680
let's see coding your own HTML using

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:19,250
naked man so so there are two plugins

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,310
that excess right now one is built by

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:25,130
automatic hwp and Google that's called

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,270
and for WordPress and the another one

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,330
that we have used

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,430
it's called apps for WP and both of this

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:34,430
are pretty confusing because only thing

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,280
that changes is WordPress and WP nothing

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:41,300
and to be honest I didn't write the

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,680
official one like the official version

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,050
because it's much easier to implement

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:49,850
and that's what we have implemented on

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:53,180
the website so here are the pros of

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:55,640
using and for WP it's it's quick setup

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,590
if you if you just want to help you find

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,740
out WordPress version you can do it

00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:03,620
within minutes then so so what does

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,440
website does is it takes a video tags

00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,570
the images tax and it just converts all

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,030
of them into n by using and video

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:15,950
automatically and it has a nice

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:18,320
interface it generates per unit HTML and

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,310
what it does is it removes all the GS

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,520
that your team has and all the MS

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:28,900
CSS and if you have if someone opens

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,529
here particularly image on vocals it

00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,450
will be next

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:36,520
automatically to the amp version of that

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:39,670
particular force constants that it stood

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,550
on a field visit for your club and right

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,800
now it renders only the wp-content in

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,810
the free version if you want to render

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,150
ACS fields you need to buy another

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,990
plugin that is no free support for

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:55,000
contract forms and has a very basic

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,890
implementation and for everything that

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,290
you want to do you have to buy atoms and

00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,650
the atoms are like $9,200 squared

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:06,370
opposites it's pretty expensive

00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:08,620
so these are the few cons of three so

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,510
here is why I was talking about not

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:16,600
using the plug-in and taking another

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:19,630
that is native man so if you record HTML

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,120
developer and you go CSS pretty well you

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,100
just need to so because this is what was

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,320
happening with my team we were using a

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,620
lot of important text and we were using

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,690
a lot of repetitive CSS if you have

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,110
learned about to not read video

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:47,410
selecting fry concepts if you use all of

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:53,500
that you can you can be used CSS page

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:55,930
and so these are the basic rules for

00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,620
native and if you follow this you don't

00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,620
need to have

00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,259
so yeah so step 1 prepare for the

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,899
nightmare if you as an HDMI developer

00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:11,379
have expired CSS we're using important

00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:14,439
times big passing and repeated CSS step

00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:17,290
you need to do is change your HTML to

00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:19,809
the HTML space and so that basically

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,629
tells Google that this is the amp page

00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:24,459
and that what you do is you use the

00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:27,100
script from Google or

00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:30,490
Siri enter and projector or cheese -

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,589
versions even RCS everything hat and

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,019
yeah just don't do this with fried

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:38,860
rivers what we did is we just downloaded

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:42,009
the old chairs and then we just uploaded

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,980
it to us so if you do that you build is

00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:47,860
going to mark your pages in there

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:51,730
because what Google does is they have

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,220
cached this home video p0 got yes in

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,189
your browser

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,319
so when you go to your website it does

00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:08,079
not have to do a round trip to print

00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:11,500
that gs5 so don't be smart and so now

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,260
initially what we did is we were we had

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,539
a donation tab that says relation is

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,399
equal to an HTML and it was pointing to

00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:24,579
another and so now this particular

00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:26,760
relation points to itself because the

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,760
page

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:35,810
then so if you want so after their so

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,780
even if you want to use an an iframe you

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:41,720
need to include a chance for my friend

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:45,380
and you can find all the list of HTML

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,630
tags that de credits of course so here

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,360
if you want to use the app video you

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:54,500
have to have the Nvidia so these are the

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:57,230
tags that campus support a partner so

00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,360
you can just go through this and you can

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,650
find the list of scripts that you need

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,670
to include so this is pretty

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:08,420
contradicted because a stupid it tells

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:10,970
you to not use spiritual God and that

00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:14,090
for everything that you do you will ask

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:22,250
you to add a new script so this is

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:26,000
pretty good so this is a study on how we

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,710
started doing video first and press

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,450
website

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,220
initially when I told my team that we

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,110
need to reduce the build a website

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,940
received a team and my team did not

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:40,490
believe so it was like the whole team

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,380
was divided me versus the team the

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,070
team's telling me that we cannot win

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,070
everything

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,519
[Music]

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:07,680
and so

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,930
[Music]

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,079
[Music]

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:50,580
from and if you want to see this

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,759
[Music]

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,680
[Music]

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,960
there's something for the stamp

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,960
animation

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,490
so so this whole thing is just just

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,290
shoulders they have a comforter so

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,770
everything that you want to do jeaious

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:13,820
 you have to go to the SEC okay you

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:15,950
have that and we'll stay okay eggless I

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,590
have a component for that and for every

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:22,310
component that you use there is a good

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:24,560
amount of documentation so so it's a

00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:29,020
it's a huge learning curve that you have

00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:32,360
to go sacrifice tomorrow yeah it's like

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,540
the whole life you were told that hTML

00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,640
is your mother and comes to you we're so

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,890
alike of you whether we have pushing for

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,160
standards for so long and now we say not

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:45,350
forget the standards definitely happens

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,890
with relational database and go sequel

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:51,320
like all the life we did was relational

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,810
database and then there's mo mo DV

00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,760
firebase everyone came and they said we

00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:59,240
don't need relational database we are

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,970
going back to find this system and so so

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,740
here is a thing

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,170
this was my own personal experience it's

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,020
not that program for something metric

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:16,370
but the movement my team built one and

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:18,110
website their HTML and CSS has because

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:22,090
Google wants you to do

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:26,980
let's stop abusing the jQuery the CSS

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:43,790
HTML because if you put one WordPress in

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:45,060
first but I used one theme for this

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:49,440
website and you can see

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:52,490
pudding headshots and I'll show you

00:22:49,440 --> 00:23:00,620
another website that was dead it's not

00:22:52,490 --> 00:23:00,620
but after using and you can see the

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,239
[Music]

00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,690
[Music]

00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:08,019
the correct manager for him and he was

00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:10,720
specifically asked as Google is fine and

00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:12,460
for spam so he says that we are not

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,679
doing it we are just trying to

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,929
standardize everything but I think one

00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,240
thing that this failed in doing was

00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:20,980
having components for everything but

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,480
they would have a component for keeping

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:28,210
or video for isolate that kind of sucks

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:40,179
and then you cannot even have inline CSS

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:49,750
right you cannot have a space style so

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:52,840
that's what our story is the power so

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,580
yeah so then we bootstrap of so here you

00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,940
see like this is a good example

00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,669
then bootstrap we were using 121 kb we

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,669
cut it down to this somewhere about 16

00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:05,860
kilo bytes because there was a lot of

00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,490
unnecessary bootstrap CSS that we've

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,529
been using

00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,870
so we'll just ripped it off and we just

00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:13,320
use the amount of CSS that we needed

00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,320
from

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,690
[Music]

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:23,769
example and you can see all the

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:28,870
components and now we use contact form

00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:33,340
seven percent but cf7 uses jQuery for

00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:37,059
validation and submitting the the output

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:40,990
to returns so what we did is we give you

00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:43,960
all the J's file that hundreds of seven

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:47,080
must use it we just removed all of its J

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,919
spent and graded code our own extension

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,660
in consumption and to do that you just

00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,190
need to

00:25:51,660 --> 00:26:02,730
this amps bomb that tells you how to

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:06,200
submit your phones using EMP so again

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:10,920
with this you need a bit of knowledge of

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:15,810
angularjs because you weren't using any

00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:18,950
chance so kind of proprietary do because

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:23,870
regular GSS butyl then HTML using

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:26,400
angularjs so we did like a bit of

00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,890
angularjs a while ago so that helped us

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,960
so if you have been doing all of this

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:34,380
like stripping of the CSS and writing

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,350
over CSS carefully we were most packed

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,690
67p location which was 17 to go back to

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:43,050
more than what Google has set the limits

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,050
for so the next thing that we did is we

00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:48,660
replaced across names so we had when Vic

00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,240
passed in that dot header or my top

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:54,900
header bottom adder we just removed them

00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:13,080
and we had dot a dot B dot C dot y 0 CQ

00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:16,680
we had two beings and we can be right

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,620
now so we just might have a good time

00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:25,190
with programming in PHP that does it for

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,190
us and compiler to fire

00:27:41,190 --> 00:28:20,070
we put it on and then in the issue IMG

00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:56,170
in which so you can do a PhD able to the

00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:59,890
browser you can change all the text so

00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:09,370
that's it was validated so now what we

00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:14,050
did is we so so this was the initial

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:16,320
visit we were loading in around like one

00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,320
point

00:29:28,890 --> 00:30:30,550
so we tell you what we are number one

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,170
thing that we're doing is the cash flow

00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,660
it's called cross with the core of

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:38,069
tennis riders that

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,069
[Music]

00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,900
[Music]

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:30,649
because all it does is it just their

00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:33,259
social sharing button and yeah reactions

00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:37,460
so you can have facebook like reactions

00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:40,220
on your so we are taking to have this

00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:43,119
somewhere in the world ranking because

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,119
to work with them

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,950
we already have so if you give someone

00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:56,409
wants this we can give you the copy of a

00:31:51,950 --> 00:32:07,190
plugin and what it basically it just

00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:12,200
replaces all the text IMG and so if you

00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:14,779
search for you here so there is a

00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,049
component called amp - look

00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:19,970
so what you do there there's nothing you

00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:28,549
just give him the data-video-id

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:32,059
----video for you in the answers so you

00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:35,740
so what we did initially we went to

00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:35,740
youtube click on the edit button

00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:41,510
and then put it up over here on your

00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:44,000
website you understand but if you to do

00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:47,090
this use em YouTube but again we used

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:58,370
until you you need to have the amp

00:32:47,090 --> 00:33:09,830
YouTube channel so that is something

00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:12,740
that we are we are still working on yeah

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:15,260
so so the another amazing thing that

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,450
Google has come up with is something

00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,440
called as m.stuart so just like you have

00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:24,770
stories for Facebook Instagram snapchat

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,790
it's all proprietary to the to the app

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,980
that you'll use it

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,110
so now Google has brought it out in the

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,160
open back so now you can have your own

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:37,520
stories on the web so the this is one

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:44,590
story that people become bit on prints a

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:48,890
and their home garden be a doozy then so

00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:51,980
this is the video of how Google wants to

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:56,030
use so so there was the Stanley Cup that

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,830
was going on social there is this story

00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,960
and and all the stories come with this

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,179
kind of item and you click this and

00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,030
these are the kind of stories that right

00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:05,950
here so this is something really amazing

00:34:05,030 --> 00:35:05,460
that Lewis

00:34:05,950 --> 00:35:05,460
and this is because if you know you can

00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,550
[Music]

00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,530
[Music]

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:53,420
and open source so I just kind of put

00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:57,040
predicted but if the one I can show you

00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:59,990
there in person but if you suggest an

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,990
interesting of the restaurant it changes

00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:05,420
its special menus every day so what they

00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:17,120
can do is they can have this whole story

00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:20,270
is created on the very small today's

00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:26,480
menu scan the QR code and the specials

00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:29,090
menu comes up straight away so another

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,500
good usage of this is if the amount of

00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:38,180
beautiful so so beautiful it has a

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:41,030
beautiful - so you just have the QR code

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:52,010
on your kit you just scan it and it just

00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:54,710
gives you but it's it's more of

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,990
affiliate marketing because now Google

00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:00,680
has generous so you can include ads

00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:03,550
within your answer so I think Washington

00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,550
Post Jetta

00:37:38,520 --> 00:38:41,290
so if you see this and you can see all

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:45,550
the stupid classes name is empty chair

00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:48,520
si HB so this is how we just comprehend

00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:51,390
and you and all your CSS needs to go

00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,390
inside this

00:38:52,490 --> 00:39:37,160
I mean yeah so this is how the question

00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:42,550
here is all your CSS goes when you can

00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,550
see this so here we had another issue we

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:55,400
then when you are doing a regex

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:58,150
replacement we say that PHP 5 don't use

00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,150
this fast

00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:14,340
so here it it's like Oh doc go space us

00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:18,690
best away and then you also need to

00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:23,040
verify this so so if you are using

00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:33,510
something like like SAS where you can

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:38,180
kind of monitor all this thing so these

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,180
are the names that we use so

00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:03,119
yes oh so original CSS does not be the

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,680
one that we're seeing here it's

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,680
completely different if I can

00:41:25,720 --> 00:42:11,080
so so so

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,350
[Music]

00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,690
[Music]

00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,860
[Music]

00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:42,570
so if you see this when you quit from

00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:45,869
this you see this because basically cash

00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:48,450
is your entire page so this thing is

00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:50,460
actually not being served from CNN

00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:53,400
website it's actually being served from

00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:56,940
the Google cache so next and Google has

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,220
car shows across so what it does it

00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:02,780
takes so basically it takes away of pain

00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,780
of using a CDN

00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,530
[Music]

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:28,520
but it really pushes you to like work

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:31,520
with instructions Jesus feet up this

00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,520
