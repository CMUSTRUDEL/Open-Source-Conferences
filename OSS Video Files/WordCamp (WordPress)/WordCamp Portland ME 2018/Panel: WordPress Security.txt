last session of the day and we are going

00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:12,210
to go out with a bang

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,519
rich and Jon and Adam here three

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,070
security experts who proved to us that

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:22,079
any security expert has a last name that

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:27,540
ends webinar so that's good to know you

00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:33,480
guys want to get enlightenment implement

00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:38,280
our sound crazy new you guys going to

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:42,180
give us a 15 30 second bio sure so rich

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,290
I work for jetpack primarily on rewind

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,430
and ball press which are two of

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,340
automatics security focused products got

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,590
a lot of experience scaling media

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,000
companies also handling security and

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:59,930
performance everything I'm John I work

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,060
for Bluehost I'm on a team that

00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,720
primarily our job is to contribute to

00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,000
core in the community or press corps

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:13,020
before that I was at Boston University

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,520
so both both areas I've had to security

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,250
is always in the forefront and making

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,570
sure our code is secure because as a

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,060
hosting company in the university were

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,680
always targets for security breaches we

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,680
always have to make sure we had all that

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,990
conflict so my name is Adam Warner I'm

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,790
the community manager for SiteLock a

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,600
company that provides cloud-based

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,130
website security services I am a long

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,880
time

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,850
WordPress user since 2005 I am NOT a

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,439
developer and I'm not a designer and I'm

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,479
not a security expert in terms of code

00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,579
but I try to spread the good word of

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:54,710
security awareness and best practices

00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:57,170
for protecting your site or business and

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,750
as we're going along if you have any

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,860
questions you can text them to me and I

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:10,099
will pass them on to the panel so to

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:14,349
kick things off it's a lot of people

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:18,110
recognize that one of the biggest

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:21,769
potential vulnerabilities on any site is

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:27,819
between the keyboard and the chair how

00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:35,090
do you what are some ways that you found

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:39,560
success in educating users on being less

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:42,560
vulnerable well so that's that's kind of

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,720
where I come in because I'm I don't like

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,510
I said I don't write code so I don't

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,209
come to website security from that side

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:53,840
but I come to it from the side of

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,730
educating end-users the importance of

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,790
website security so one of one of the

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,310
things I do to relate the importance of

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,049
security for your site to people is to

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,709
put in terms that they can understand

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:09,560
and what that usually means is anyone

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:11,660
who has a website typically has a

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,030
passion or a business and that's the

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:18,230
purpose of their site so when we talk

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:20,389
about website security to them we put it

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:25,819
in terms of protecting your passion or

00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:27,470
your business right and in from where I

00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,139
come from it's all about educating

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,299
people about security and in my my talk

00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,889
earlier that is kind of the theme

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,109
throughout because a lot of people when

00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,140
you talk to someone the average business

00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:39,330
owner or maybe the

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,460
technical person they here website

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,160
security and they go either one of two

00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,750
things my catalog isn't important enough

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,140
to protect why would anybody want to

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,520
hack it or Security's way too technical

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,930
it's over my head I don't want to hear

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,450
anything about it

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,780
so if you if you kind of communicate the

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,690
the basic reasons why websites get

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,870
hacked it's a lot easier for them to

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,990
process the importance of it and I think

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,090
from a different perspective like a

00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,240
developer perspective someone that's

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,000
writing code for your website following

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,519
best practices knowing about different

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,370
like current exploits that are going on

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,950
and how they're being mitigated and

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:26,070
prevented for the future and just just

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,540
following WordPress does when they do a

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,800
security release and other open source

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,110
projects when they do a security

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
released a detail what it is and why it

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,820
happened and how it prevents it so these

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,290
things are very important to kind of

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,470
have your thumb on the pulse of what's

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:45,120
going on there and it's also an

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,220
education thing a lot of people I have

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,210
some friends where they use they say

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,979
they use the same password for

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,770
everything but they don't really

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:55,260
understand why that's bad or it might

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,060
just be their dog's name and their

00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,200
birthday and they may not understand why

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,700
that's bad so a lot of it is just they

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,070
don't understand how someone would go

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,020
about trying to exploit something so

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,360
maybe if you explain to them well with a

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,760
computer that would take three seconds

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,310
to get into your website and maybe show

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,050
them a little demonstration and then it

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,510
might click and then they might have

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,660
that more secure mindset in the future

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:25,330
sure yeah so I'm an old school code

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,740
hacker right this this social

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,230
engineering thing is actually a little

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,810
bit above my head but it's it's the new

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,910
scary thing right like there are not a

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,340
lot of kids in their basements you know

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,480
writing programs that are as dangerous

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,800
as social engineering has become

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,360
responding to the wrong email clicking

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,210
the wrong button these are the things

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,430
that really get you in trouble now and I

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,610
think the solution starts here in this

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,110
room right now right spreading awareness

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,720
explaining to you why password security

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,340
is important why social engineering is

00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,960
something you should recognize and have

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,460
training on yeah and clickbait and fake

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,650
news and getting people to share things

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,020
that aren't true and people just don't

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,530
read they just see that headline and and

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,950
so just a more intuitive mindset of

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,110
asking why you're asking who what where

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,030
this is coming from and just a simple

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,320
follow up or a simple Google search and

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,110
a lot of time disproved a lot of this

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,900
stuff work prove prove it

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:28,210
you know so that that's just a very it's

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,940
always why and and how come and then

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,660
just being analytical and more intuitive

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:39,040
and questioning things is another way

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:41,130
you know and when you were at you how

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,680
prevalent did you see

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,970
fishing and spear phishing attacks

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,390
internally we got a lot of different

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:52,720
emails so it was everything from hey

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,550
there's new HR training to sign up for

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,860
discounted health insurance as an

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,230
employee we got some really strange ones

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,880
the most popular one was probably take

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,610
this survey like we're trying to get

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,900
information so a lot of times in

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,640
sluggers made to look like was it a

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,660
general survey yep it was basically like

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,380
hey we're looking to get employed

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,039
feedback so I wasn't uncommon probably

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,229
once a month there would be some

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,050
posting in slack hey didn't anybody else

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:20,809
get this is this legit and then someone

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,460
would follow up with people in other

00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:25,520
departments that would have issued these

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,289
research initiatives to to say that when

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,969
we had an email to forward them to as

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,809
well and a lot of times they would

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:36,949
confirm or deny the legitimacy of it I

00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:39,710
know it an automatic a few years ago and

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:45,639
that might have been before you join one

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:48,229
of the projects of the week a group of

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,469
automatic employees tried to fish the

00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:53,860
rest of the company and get them to

00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:56,779
enter their wordpress.com password and

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,419
they were able to successfully get

00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,039
credentials for more than 50 percent of

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:05,289
the company

00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:11,300
and these are you know tech savvy people

00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:12,529
including a number of members of yeah I

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,959
think when you when you talk about

00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:18,409
security one of the most important

00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:22,189
places to start is that awareness right

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:24,559
and so I tell this story walking through

00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,830
the city of Chicago after seeing a

00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:29,389
concert coming from the Chicago theater

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,849
with my wife and getting that uneasy

00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,529
feeling you know your intuition my hairs

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,139
on the back of your neck and I look

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,419
behind and there's a guy about a half a

00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:39,949
block away and so I get that easy uneasy

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,419
feeling I moved to the other side of the

00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:42,649
road he moves to the other side of the

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,540
room we moved to the other side of the

00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:45,920
road he even was back so I was like hey

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,449
honey why don't we duck into this bar

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,190
and get a drink and it didn't tell her

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:50,829
anything that was good

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,600
we walked in there and I'm not

00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:56,230
exaggerating he walked by and went like

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,180
this just steered right at us as you as

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,940
he was walking by talk about a creepy

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,069
feeling but you relate that to website

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,870
security and in your daily interactions

00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:12,220
right so it's good to be paranoid every

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,410
day and aware of security issues every

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,579
day but you have to really try and find

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,089
that balance so you're not walking

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:21,129
around you know peeking around corners

00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,540
so things like you know we're talking

00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:26,139
website security but things like

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:30,970
personal identity security if you're

00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:33,040
going to an ATM you might want to look

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,949
at where your card goes oh there's a

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,319
video on youtube look for ATM Vienna and

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:40,870
you will see it's one of the green

00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:43,029
covers a guy goes up there he notices

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,490
little beads of glue on that on the edge

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,889
of the green cover shakes it and it's a

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,920
it's a card skimmer so stuff like that

00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:52,839
every day that you can train yourself to

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:58,360
be aware of and then relate that

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,980
obviously to your site as well gaspar

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,930
soon they started putting those stickers

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,930
over the over the

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:11,200
the theme the seam of it yeah yeah if

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,490
you're interested there's a great

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,910
episode of the podcast reply-all

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:23,260
what kind of idiot gets fished and in

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:26,110
working on the story I think most of the

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,960
members of the team were fished while

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:33,070
working on a story about fishing and

00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,260
looking at it every day so yeah that's a

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,630
hopeful exercise to like maybe you work

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,510
with a couple executives and a member of

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,340
the security team if you have that and

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:45,250
you know try to fish everyone in this in

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,540
the department and make it so you can't

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,970
see their password but you would know

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,530
that they put their password in and just

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,630
as an educational thing like sometimes

00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,690
it takes that to kind of wake up and

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,770
realize what you've done

00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:01,590
and I think there are some companies

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,590
that you can hire to try and fish you're

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:22,000
right yeah yeah make sure they're not

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:24,310
the fishers so you're talking about

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,140
awareness in your daily life and then

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,990
kind of the second base line for me is

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,540
password security that we kind of just

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,300
talked about it and secure and unique

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,660
passwords for every single volume that

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,300
you have from your home Wi-Fi to your

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,610
local machine to every internet site

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:46,600
having unique and strong passwords for

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,550
for every login and then of course how

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,980
do you keep track of that to define

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,780
unique and long yeah

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,410
and for those of you that saw my talked

00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,720
earlier I've mold them where I

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,490
previously worked I decrypted everyone's

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,500
passwords to prove a point

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:07,420
guess who's got decrypted all Silla I

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,119
thought it was good it wasn't good like

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:13,939
to consider what unique

00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:16,429
meets and consider purchasing the

00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:21,229
password manager or something there's a

00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:24,289
there's a great xkcd comment that talks

00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:31,849
about password strength and bits of

00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:36,729
entropy and how as you every time you

00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:40,359
had a character it becomes significantly

00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:43,339
takes more effort they would say yeah

00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:45,859
yeah I saw something a little while ago

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:50,539
and I'll try to find it and I'll post on

00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:53,359
Twitter but it was a dataset where they

00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:56,259
analyzed I think they took all the all

00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:59,749
the publicly released password hacks

00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:03,499
that were available and they analyzed

00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:06,439
all the passwords and they posted some

00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:08,839
graphs and some he maps as to what what

00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:12,799
was going on and the heat maps made it

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:15,829
very clear that when a password requires

00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,359
capital letter 70% of people whatever

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,639
the number was had it the first letter

00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:24,019
they needed a special character it was

00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:25,759
almost always at the end the numbers

00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,969
they had a chart of the the number

00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,429
frequency in in and it basically

00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:34,159
indicated that it was like birthdays or

00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:36,319
birth years or anniversaries and it was

00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,229
like it was interesting how it faded off

00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:42,139
and you could very clearly see like what

00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:43,489
patterns were in people's passwords so

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,549
just being aware of those things and

00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:49,219
knowing like what common human

00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:50,479
behavioral elements are that people just

00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:53,089
are comfortable with and they just

00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:55,699
that's how they think but being secure

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,089
is sometimes reversing that or doing the

00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,819
unexpected in order to

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:02,809
be more secure yeah after all I just

00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:05,699
wrote up there it's have I been poned

00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:07,229
or.com for size passwords if you put a

00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:09,179
password in there that you've used in

00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:12,389
the past it'll tell you if it's appeared

00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:14,099
in any data breaches and your your your

00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:19,829
email - it will tell you if your email

00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:21,269
appears anywhere so like I think I think

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:23,339
when I know so I don't say I think

00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:26,819
LinkedIn had some data hacked a while

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,589
ago but it will say whose email like the

00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:30,179
emails that were hacked but it will also

00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,399
tell you what data was hacked your

00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,529
birthday or your friend list or your

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,369
your password and then you can make more

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:41,339
informed when your privacy levels in

00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:44,479
your password isn't something it always

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:47,009
jumps out as a red flag to me when I'm

00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:51,479
setting a password somewhere and they

00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:54,389
have limitations on length or what carry

00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:56,939
house you can yeah I mean you should be

00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:59,549
hashing passwords and if you are the

00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:03,199
none of that should matter so it's kind

00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:07,289
of a scary scary thing when you see that

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,339
it was a in WordPress is everybody

00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:11,039
familiar with the password strength

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:13,109
meter so that was one of the first

00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,079
things I brought up to add to WordPress

00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:19,859
but that's a Dropbox library and it was

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,439
a library that they built in JavaScript

00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:23,189
to calculate the strength based on

00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:27,719
different factors

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:30,899
it's called ZX cbn it's basically just

00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:34,669
the bottom of the keyboard to end but it

00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:37,079
it talks about that and it takes several

00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:39,899
popular websites including some banks

00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,549
and some big financial companies and it

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,730
talks about the limitations and

00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:46,740
characters and how that affects

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,100
the entropy of the password and how

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,950
secure it is and it's very limiting like

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,780
like an eight to ten eight to twelve

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:58,770
character password can still be cracked

00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,990
usually in like an hour at the most

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,350
even if you're using good practices and

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,760
in your password so those limits are oh

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,740
yeah they're always alarming it's like

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,900
what all my money is in here and I can

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,900
only put a 6 character password yeah

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,710
yeah that's what we get in such a frenzy

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,750
when we're told you know you go to log

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,570
in your bank or whatever and take your

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,770
password we're such a work we're rushing

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,440
we're in such a frenzy that we just

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,210
throw our birthday and then we're like

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,150
oh I'll go back later but but we don't

00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,460
and the implications of that

00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:36,000
far-reaching because all of these

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,930
services are connected yes I think I was

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,150
just saying I think it comes back to

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,740
again human behavior you put in what

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,290
you're used to because you remember it

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:47,220
but things are getting like the new iOS

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:49,740
you can have on most apps there's a

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,270
button you click it and it uses it pulls

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,960
up your password manager and you can put

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:57,360
it in and so when you enter I use one

00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,060
pass so it's hooked up to my iPhone and

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,910
if I'm on my computer you know and I put

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:06,600
in a password it syncs over in my iCloud

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,280
and I can put in as long a password as I

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,860
want because it's gonna help me as long

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,170
as I log in whatever means it will let

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:17,520
me just paste it in iOS pelvis awesome

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,170
it's it's super sweet

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,329
not everything supports it yet and I

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,150
always um I call how did I live without

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:27,740
this before but no it's not a solution

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,740
to one of the biggest frustrations

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:41,330
if I'm going to financial site 70 seems

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:44,050
if I type in the wrong password three

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,050
times right thing

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,409
that can be hard yeah that's basically

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,720
to prevent brute-force hacking so that's

00:17:55,409 --> 00:18:00,600
basically they set up a computer and

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,570
they just try every single password that

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,400
it can and eventually it's gonna get it

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:09,840
they might take millions of years it

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,940
might take 10 seconds you know so it's

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,710
it's that makes it harder to get around

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,929
that but then they also introduces a

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,770
user frustration like well I I really

00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,549
just can't remember and you know and it

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,260
doesn't tell you the password

00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:24,090
requirements either so you don't know

00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,700
like oh this one requires a capital so

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,080
my dog's name is capitalized in my night

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,030
all it needs numbers that put his

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,200
birthday you know whatever so you don't

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,669
know that and so sometimes you just

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,190
forget but yeah that's that's hard to

00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:40,289
get around then it's probably ways well

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,380
that's where that's where you jump off

00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:45,720
of passwords and you get into to factor

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,600
and multi-factor authentication right so

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,419
you've all tried to log in somewhere and

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,250
you have to first to have a code that's

00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,870
sent to your phone so you can enter the

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,260
code I'll get to the login screen

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:01,679
that's two-factor multi-factor is the

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:04,909
same but you have a phone and some other

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,130
method that you have to verify to now

00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:09,780
who knows in the future maybe you know

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:14,100
we've got fingerprint already on our

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,570
laptops and our phones there's nothing

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,940
that says in the future there might not

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:23,130
be a DNA based security for any kind of

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,490
devices or even our vehicles our homes

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,650
or who knows you know the that's the

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,150
kind of stuff I'm I like to read about

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,309
and I'm interested in because at some

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:36,500
point passwords are going to be cracked

00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:39,000
and it won't matter if it's a 64 length

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,900
password at some point the computing

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,419
power is just gonna be there right so

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:48,030
and so I think nowadays right like Brune

00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:51,210
forcing your financial institutions

00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,669
password at with you as a specific

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,220
target sure might be tricky might be

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:58,980
doable might not but when you look at

00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,250
the entire scope of all these millions

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,559
of users at this financial institution

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,570
and you go mm-hmm download that data

00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,000
they're gonna have hits they're gonna

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,710
get in to some people's accounts now if

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,390
you've used that password somewhere else

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,909
it's a good chance that's how they get

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,250
into your specific account if you have

00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:17,960
practiced good password security and

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,460
you're using a long evening password for

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,220
every different thing they're not

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,539
getting into your pay not that way

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,960
that's one of the nice things that one

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:29,780
password does as well as they compare

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,960
your data against the half iPhone you

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:37,640
know debase so it'll show you this this

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,230
password was exposed in a breach or and

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,240
and sometimes it's just they take the

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,549
email and the password there and they

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,039
hit every single site in their list they

00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,630
might get into a couple they might not

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,600
and sometimes like the data that's

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,030
published to educate people they use it

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,270
against people so maybe they hit the

00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:59,120
bank and they try the bank might not

00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,159
walk out different username attempts it

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,690
might not use IP address or machine so

00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,990
they might hit every single possible

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:08,390
username with the top three passwords in

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,940
the world and they might hit something

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,770
they might not but if they get into one

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,049
and there's a couple thousand dollars in

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,220
there this is like 10 minutes script

00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:18,799
that they wrote to go through this

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,000
database of possibilities sometimes is

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,000
more than worth it

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:31,649
y'all share a stat that some of you may

00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:34,169
have heard earlier but hackers will tell

00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:37,409
you even hackers that aren't world class

00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:39,690
best in the world hackers if they're

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:43,200
targeting somebody they will compromise

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:45,479
them 100% of the time if you become a

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,440
target you're gonna get owned like it's

00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:48,960
that simple

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,690
whether you're a business or personal

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,070
they love to brag hackers love to brag

00:21:51,690 --> 00:22:08,039
usually well that's how the majority of

00:21:53,070 --> 00:22:11,249
them get so there are a number of them

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:15,839
out there I would say the most popular

00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:20,339
ones are security I theme security and

00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:24,269
word fence so in my opinion any security

00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:30,049
plug-in oh and sorry and Jack has the

00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:33,269
brute force and also scanner don't think

00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:36,059
they're all good right they all do good

00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:39,179
things and what you're seeing with those

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:41,369
solutions are immediate feedback on kind

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,729
of the security the baseline security

00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:47,429
health of your website so I wouldn't

00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:51,149
recommend one over the other I would

00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:52,799
just look at the specific features and

00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:55,979
benefits of each one and then make that

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,049
decision just you know based on your

00:22:55,979 --> 00:23:02,639
personal preference but I would also

00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:04,889
argue that in addition to plug-in based

00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:07,799
security you would also want to look for

00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:10,799
something that's cloud based as well

00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:13,799
so whether that's a scanner or a web

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,070
application firewall web application

00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:19,150
firewalls in my opinion are probably the

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,800
number two most important thing or

00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,350
for one most important thing that you

00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,059
could do to help secure any website and

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,950
for those of you that don't know what a

00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:28,240
Web Application Firewall is it's

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,340
basically a hardware and software

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,930
solution that sits between someone

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,960
requesting data from your host and it's

00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:40,840
designed to automatically block excuse

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,210
me malicious scripts because that's the

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:49,030
majority of the hacking that happened

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:51,970
it's all automated BOTS so so a Web

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,500
Application Firewall one automatically

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,240
stops malicious scripts because it

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,559
identifies them before it even gets to

00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,020
your web server before it has a chance

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,510
to look for weak passwords or look for

00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,700
outdated software but then if you do

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,530
experience a DDoS or some kind of a

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,410
brute force attack usually the Web

00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,870
Application Firewall will recognize that

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,260
as well because those are kind of AI

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,450
based so they should be able to

00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,600
recognize that sort of thing I would add

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,040
one thing to that I don't know the

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,330
advantages and disadvantages of all the

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,580
different products but whichever one you

00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,950
do select make sure they have good

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,290
support so that if you do have an issue

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,610
you can talk to a human and they can

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,620
help you work through it because unless

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,210
you're a dev or an engineer like you

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,760
might get stuck in being a worse

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,230
situation right just knowing you've been

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,059
hacked or knowing there's this attack

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,429
going on doesn't really help you solve

00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:43,690
the problem and if you don't have the

00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:45,460
level of confidence to get through that

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,610
definitely make sure you have good

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,940
support on the other end and in to add

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:53,260
to that too don't go crazy don't be I'm

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,240
gonna have the most secure site I'm

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,050
gonna put all of them on inactivate them

00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,900
all at once

00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:00,910
then don't always work but the right

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,120
plugin will also be different for every

00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:06,220
site you might be for some reason very

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,170
susceptible to brute-force attacks you

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,270
know someone else might be very

00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,100
susceptible to DDoS attacks or someone

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,990
requests your site a millions of

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,450
millions of times a minute and it just

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,429
brings your server down so then the

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,470
needs are gonna be different from a bank

00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:23,580
to you know your blog that you write

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:28,530
about political things or whatever your

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:31,230
content is well yeah it's it's that you

00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:33,120
might be able to use some in tandem but

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:36,750
it's usually better to pick the one that

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:41,160
best suits your needs and use that on

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:43,440
the wide area concept one thing I like

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,050
to recommend is cloud flare so cloud

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,320
flare has that concept but it does it on

00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:51,990
the DNS level so it intercepts part of

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,710
the like earlier in the request it's

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,240
also similar to how jetpack does it and

00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,360
protects against the brute force is a

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,490
kind of crowd sources the data so if

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,410
your site gets attacked and it's this

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,720
bot and it gets identified as malicious

00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,520
and you're also on CloudFlare and then

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,850
it goes and attacks him it already knows

00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,460
that that's a bad person so it's like by

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:18,140
crowdsourcing the data it makes it more

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,500
powerful much better to protect you

00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,500
however many

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,800
who's got the next question I think we

00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,800
have about eating that

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:49,610
I wish that everybody used a VPN that's

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:53,630
a virtual private network so when you're

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:57,380
connecting to the University Wi-Fi or in

00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:59,059
the coffee shop you activate a VPN on

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,010
your laptop or your phone and it

00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:06,730
encrypts the data that's going between

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:10,820
your device and the Wi-Fi because Wi-Fi

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:16,580
Road wi-fi's and Wi-Fi sniffing is a

00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:18,830
thing search Betsy Davies and she's an

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,660
11 year old girl whose dad showed her a

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,750
YouTube video and she went to the coffee

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,210
shop set up a fake Wi-Fi signal and then

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,730
started sniffing everybody's traffic I'm

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,740
looking at the data on their devices

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,410
it's a real thing and just be aware too

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,090
if you go to a Starbucks it's like some

00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:43,010
Google Starbucks but it's not Google

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:49,070
Starbucks plus them us em it's not us

00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:53,240
and guests with two S's I think they

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:57,559
have two one is on us as web industry

00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:00,470
people versus HTTP so having an SSL

00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,360
certificate on your site is free now

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,270
there's really no reason why you

00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,740
shouldn't have it at Bluehost we it

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,210
doesn't matter we automatically

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,330
provision you with the let's let's

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:13,730
encrypt SSL certificate and it renews

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,740
every three months and it just is there

00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:18,080
for you but it's still something that's

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,870
not not widely adapt adopted by many

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,760
sites and so basically what that will do

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,100
is it will protects your traffic with

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,390
your users from being intercepted

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,920
between their computer and your server

00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,270
so it's just it's a very easy thing to

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,100
get set up a lot of times you can just

00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,080
reach out to your host support and ask

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,780
them to configure it for you and they

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,980
handle it there are it's very expensive

00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:44,980
ones but they basically they've ouch and

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,400
they audit the server a bit

00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:51,040
to make sure that it actually is secure

00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,530
but a general free one is more than good

00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,750
to at least get you started on that and

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:59,820
the other one would just be higher

00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:02,620
higher requirements for passwords or

00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,720
maybe you have a bunch of developers on

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,360
your repositories in your organization

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,250
your organization on github can require

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,520
two-factor authentication for all your

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,620
your your members so taking that

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,210
initiative and and increasing your

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,630
security in your organization and lead

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:21,760
by example is another one and yeah just

00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,559
like I said before just helping to

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,540
educate people and opening their eyes

00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,400
and trying to get them to realize why

00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:32,290
it's important for them to for this to

00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,840
be important in your business that's all

00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:37,929
very very sound technical advice and I

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:41,380
completely agree but my number one thing

00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:44,080
would be awareness right like ask the

00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,750
question am i secure have this

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,400
conversation with somebody else have

00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:53,169
this conversation with the people in

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:56,980
your family you know we're starting to

00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:59,049
see how deeply embedded security is into

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,570
our lives I mean people's financial

00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:04,059
lives get ruined you know their

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:07,720
reputations get ruined and this is only

00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:12,210
going to get far worse if we don't start

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,210
spreading awareness so that's my tip

00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:20,820
Adam do you still see VPNs and being as

00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:25,139
valuable as they were say five years ago

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:28,350
with the wider proliferation of SSL

00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:34,080
certs I know like personally I don't use

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:37,049
a VPN as often as I did because almost

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,679
every state has SSL yeah well I do think

00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:43,559
it's still as important just because of

00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,779
that simple fact of its it's not just

00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,820
it's not just the site you're visiting

00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:49,769
right it's the it's the data that's

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,749
floating through the air

00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:54,119
and in terms of connecting to a Wi-Fi

00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:57,779
signal I think that's where it's

00:30:54,119 --> 00:31:00,269
important yeah comes in right but you're

00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:02,970
right it's it's there's there's probably

00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:05,879
a good a good debate there whether it is

00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:11,039
as important as it used to be but for me

00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:13,379
it is yeah I think it is because a lot

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,779
of times now you're not just protecting

00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:18,299
yourself from hackers but you're also

00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:20,249
protecting yourself from people that

00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:22,289
don't maliciously have malicious intent

00:31:20,249 --> 00:31:25,080
so maybe your internet service provider

00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:27,809
has server logs of you as a customer

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,700
what sites you start visit you stop

00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:31,769
visiting so maybe you go to something

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,840
very controversial and then somebody

00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:35,789
gets a hold of that list and you might

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,320
have been just researching something but

00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:39,690
then all of a sudden you're associated

00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,909
with this website and that's that's now

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,070
dangerous and you might not be able to

00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:46,499
trust these big corporations and I'm not

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,269
trying to be conspiracy theory making

00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:49,649
you all scared but it's something you

00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:51,899
should think about it we all know it

00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:53,489
happens it happens and it's happened in

00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:56,369
history and it happens in other

00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:57,749
countries that are less politically free

00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:59,730
than we are you know and there's

00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,850
oppression so it's it's something to

00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:05,609
think about and it's it's a healthy

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:08,789
discussion to have and but a VPN would

00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:10,200
in most cases prevent your internet

00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:12,360
service provider from God knowing what

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,820
you're going to yea

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,580
internet law is still very much the Wild

00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,250
West like we don't know what's gonna

00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,810
happen and you don't know who works at

00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,270
the company maybe the company is very

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:27,540
good but they might just get this one I

00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:32,640
kind of a bad example but with the whole

00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:35,730
the guy that Edward Snowden like he

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,110
worked in government and he saw

00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,640
something and he blew a whistle and it

00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:43,290
was a good whistle blow but you know

00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,520
who's to say it's a good whistle blow

00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,260
maybe someone thinks they're doing good

00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,930
but they're actually doing harm by

00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,400
exposing certain things and so it might

00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,400
not just be a company it might also be

00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:57,920
one person acting with data they have

00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:00,780
that is indicative of something you do

00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:06,030
do you have a VPN solution you like I

00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:09,360
like tunnel there it's tunnel bury aside

00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:12,840
from having a super cute mascot it's

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:17,010
that they wear dress yeah they have a

00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,540
free free level but then the paid level

00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:22,080
I think starts at nine bucks a month or

00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:23,330
something is it too late that's not

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,009
usually one if you have

00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:41,809
the best go no it's never too late start

00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:44,539
now started today I like to the answer

00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:47,419
to that question from me as two things

00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:50,299
there's no such thing as 100% security

00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:52,999
in life or on the internet there just

00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:56,330
isn't and there never will be so in my

00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:58,700
mind it's about reducing that attack

00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,909
radius right so when you're using a

00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,409
password manager you're reducing that

00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,139
attack radius but there's still that

00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:12,460
chance that that password manager

00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:15,109
service will get hacked potentially yeah

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,179
LastPass has been hacked before but the

00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:19,159
hack didn't because because they're a

00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:22,839
security company and they put a bunch of

00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,369
different layers of protection in the

00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:27,169
people who hacked LastPass didn't get

00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:30,799
access to the actual usernames and

00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:33,109
passwords and I'd rather entrust all of

00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:36,049
that stuff to a company that is that's

00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:38,329
their core business right instead of my

00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:40,210
notepad in my drawer that is also why

00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:42,740
enabling two-factor authentication

00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:45,349
everywhere that you can is very

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:47,389
important yeah good question though cuz

00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:50,389
that is nice it always comes down to

00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:54,710
that I know I know one password your

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:57,260
your vault is encrypted locally so it's

00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,390
synced in their servers between devices

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:03,260
but they don't have access to the data

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:05,839
in your in your fault

00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,849
because that's the one password you have

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,460
to remember and that one can be really

00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:11,690
secure and really long but it's the one

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:16,829
yep

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:19,529
1password yeah I think in the other part

00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:21,569
of that too is that hackers want the

00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:23,849
easy wins they don't want to spend their

00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:25,740
time on the on the passwords that they

00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:27,420
gonna take down three days to crap

00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,880
most of the time if it takes more than

00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,190
like 20-30 seconds they're not

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,660
interested they want to move on and it's

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,779
about getting as many people as they can

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:40,859
as easy as they can and so being

00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:42,480
proactive and 2fa having a long password

00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,640
secure password that's hard to crack

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,490
these are just things you can do to kind

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,220
of get them to move along all right

00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:57,210
thank you guys very much for your time

00:35:50,220 --> 00:36:00,269
and expertise today and look forward to

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,420
seeing everyone at the party in what it

00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:02,420
