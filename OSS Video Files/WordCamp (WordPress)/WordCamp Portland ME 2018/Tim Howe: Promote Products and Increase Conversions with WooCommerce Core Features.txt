this is the commerce talk about

00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:12,610
promoting and increasing conversions

00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:17,210
with WooCommerce core functionality so

00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:19,120
begin so real quick my name is Tim how I

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,420
work for our Paul internet marketing

00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,250
where a woops Bert agency I'm a web

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,590
developer by trade and that is my

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,540
twitter handle i tweeted out these

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,379
slides earlier so if anyone wants to

00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,870
grab a copy or follow along just check

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:39,649
that out what we're gonna be topping

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:42,800
talking about in this is really quick go

00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:45,199
over some core features that are in

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,890
commerce that I think are sometimes

00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:50,780
overlooked or underutilized and we're

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,749
gonna just cover these topics of real

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,870
quick product types related products

00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:59,629
upsells cross sells ways to promote on

00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,809
your site and then kind of the sales

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:06,260
coupon deal all the fun stuff

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:08,450
just a quick note this is all gonna be

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,119
stuff that is available in WooCommerce

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,040
core but it is very helpful to also have

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,850
a theme that is will commerce compatible

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,840
to make sure all these items work so

00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,420
real quick we're just gonna start with

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,670
product types a lot of times it just

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,280
it's important to make sure you're using

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:31,909
the correct product type for its

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,340
intended need real quickly the primary

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,020
ones just about 90% of sites will use

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,930
are going to be simple and variable

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,899
products really quickly simple products

00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:45,170
are essentially I have a beanie hat one

00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:47,390
size fits most its comes in one color

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,700
there are no options so it's a simple

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,460
product variable products or something

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,229
more like a shirt I sell this t-shirt or

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,560
I sell this shirt it comes in different

00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:00,770
sizes small medium and large so we have

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,979
that we allow the customer options on

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:07,369
selecting in that product essentially

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,780
that product is in that scenario there

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,160
are three options it

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,650
similar to having three separate

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,980
products but then displayed and promoted

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,630
on a single page additional

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,390
opportunities which we covering later

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,450
are grouped products these are one of

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,500
the items that is often underutilized it

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,970
can allow you a additional page for

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,220
getting more traffic something else for

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,140
people to land on but it's more for

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,020
products that you have in your catalog

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:40,820
that may be sold as a group together so

00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:43,880
I sell a full outfit of shirt pants and

00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,590
hat all those can be sold separately on

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,870
my site but then I can also create them

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,150
as a group product so it alleviates a

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,100
couple steps for my customers they can

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,920
then just purchase this one group

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,019
product get all three items sent right

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,640
to them and additionally I then have

00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,400
another landing page where I can write

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,900
unique content and copy to drive more

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:08,030
traffic to my site and last external or

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,280
affiliate products we aren't really

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,200
going to cover these but they are a nice

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,590
little feature in there if you do any

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,670
affiliate selling so this is especially

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,890
handful if you want to do like drop

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,440
shipping or something don't want to deal

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,750
with actual inventory warehousing or

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,910
actually shipping you can create a

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,799
product page promote that product and

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,290
hopefully you'll have an affiliate link

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,150
and then it'll actually send them to

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:37,700
another site where they make that

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:39,739
purchase the idea being you're providing

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,440
the service of marketing for that other

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,299
company and they're handling all the

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,709
actual logistics of running the

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:50,329
e-commerce side for you

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,680
so there's also visual virtual and

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:54,410
downloadable products we are going to

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,709
really cover but in case your product is

00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:01,790
virtual or downloadable so no actual

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,930
stock on hand so related products

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,620
upsells and cross-sells

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,590
this is one of the bread and butter of

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:14,079
WooCommerce it helps you organize and

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:16,430
kind of catalog and set up your site to

00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,280
essentially allow customers to find

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,440
exactly what they want

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,130
and potentially something they didn't

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,980
know you had it's important to make sure

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,950
you're categorizing and tagging products

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,620
properly categories would be more

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,650
general things for throughout your

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,330
entire store I like to think of again

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,430
going to the apparel like selling

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,540
apparel or outfits you may have a kids

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,880
or you know men's women's kids

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:50,590
categories as well as you know shirts

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,630
pants all that so tags are a little bit

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,330
more loose so you could use tags to

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,830
maybe denote like colors but then it

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:02,490
also offers you another option to help

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:06,190
customers find what they're looking for

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:10,060
those that tax on those taxonomy z' are

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,730
what really drive related products so

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,130
related products are basically anything

00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,290
kind of related to the current product

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,750
they're looking at it's helpful and

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,150
we'll go through a couple examples of

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:26,290
kind of link building and showing off

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,690
what you have in the store upsells are

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,200
also usually displayed along with

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:34,479
related products on the product page

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,180
these are helpful to allow you to kind

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,080
of push people to buy higher-margin

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,390
products so things that I'll get you

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,180
more revenue and then cross sells are

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:46,150
usually displayed within the checkout

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,340
our cart area it's just another

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,830
opportunity to kind of get people to

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,040
hopefully buy more suppose start looking

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,370
at a couple examples of that so here's a

00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,640
real simple this is just using the

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:04,600
storefront theme with stock WooCommerce

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,330
and the WooCommerce sample data I set up

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,860
a store related products so these are

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,710
all kind of related because they are

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,200
under the accessory category so I'm

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,500
selling a hat hey you might want to buy

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,540
some slick shades to go in your hat so I

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,440
want to make sure you know I have that

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:26,560
and potentially you'll buy a $80 pair of

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,790
sunglasses as opposed to an $80 hat or

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,280
hopefully both the benefit to this to

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,390
is it's going to get you link building

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,180
throughout your site

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,490
so as crawlers come here or even users

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,110
they're gonna come to this one page and

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:46,540
then notice you have a lot more

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:49,720
accessories to offer the one item that

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,300
might prevent you from wanting to put

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,030
related products on your product page is

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,040
if they are on a very high margin

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,580
product for you you may want to not

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,370
include them just to you know try to

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,840
help push them through making that

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,590
decision for the higher margin Pro

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,830
higher margin product so will now look

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,820
at a couple other examples upsells I

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:18,040
find these are almost rarely used but

00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,410
they're extremely helpful so in this

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,750
scenario I have the beanie with just a

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,700
logo knowing that you're looking at the

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,160
beanie with the logo I could try to

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:30,970
upsell you to why not get the whole set

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,410
so this is a group product it offers

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,080
more to my customer

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,230
it's just higher value higher revenue

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,590
and hopefully efficiency so they go from

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:46,240
buying one to buying you know three

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:48,310
products from my store here's an upsell

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,820
example of kind of like an alternative

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,250
option so in this scenario I'm thinking

00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,230
I'm selling this beanie they're both the

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,900
same price so it's not necessarily more

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,000
revenue but this beanie might be cheaper

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,570
to manufacture so then I'm not printing

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,750
a logo on it it's you know 18 dollars

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,700
for both but I may be only spending five

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,470
dollars to produce that beanie and six

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,570
dollars to produce the one with the logo

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,000
so it's a nice upsell to be like if

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,470
maybe this is another alternative for

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,370
you it's gonna be a higher margin for me

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:26,290
and then lastly similar product but kind

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,560
of the reverse they might have the same

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,510
margin but obviously this one being

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,210
twenty dollars versus eighteen dollars

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,040
if they're still kind of I'm paying six

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,840
bucks to produce both I'm gonna get a

00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,320
higher margin out of getting them to

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,860
spend

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,840
more on my site so those are upsells

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,670
they're always per dude they're

00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,230
generally shown on the product page and

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,300
again - they have the benefits of the

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,650
related product but hopefully you're

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:56,250
gonna be getting more money out of these

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:58,170
items and last but not least cross cells

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,450
so these are kind of a little

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,880
interesting there usually want to be

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,040
products that are complementary to the

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,140
item they're getting so again these are

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,170
kind of accessories along with the

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,390
accessories are currently buying the

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,960
hope being that you've come here and

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,220
you've committed to buying the beanie

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:23,830
maybe I can convince you to get the

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:26,620
sunglasses - you might to run into a

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,360
scenario where it might not be in your

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,700
benefit to include cross sells on that

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,220
checkout process if they've already put

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,840
the beanie in their cart you might want

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,520
to distract them with something else and

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,290
try to push them to that proceed to

00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,870
checkout to get them through the

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,060
conversion process faster but it's

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:49,030
definitely a tool in the toolbox to keep

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:53,860
in mind when building the site next

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:57,160
promotions I find a lot of times these

00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:02,140
are the most underutilized almost not

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:05,350
known about items low solo stock

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:09,610
notification in the in the WooCommerce

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,980
settings you can set stock notifications

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,960
this will basically appear and let

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:19,630
people know how many you have on hand

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:22,270
and you can kind of create some urgency

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,100
and this is right in core so it's not

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,710
like a third plug-in you have to add in

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,460
and it's just a handy tool

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,710
additionally store notice if you do a

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,720
fresh install of WooCommerce a lot of

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,760
times the store notice is automatically

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,960
turned on and it says like this is a

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,790
demo store so you know things aren't

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,290
actually being sold a lot of times I

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,819
think people look at that store notice

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,589
and say

00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:49,019
okay I see the point of this is like

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,999
kind of to alert people this sites and

00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,379
development are under destruction what

00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:55,919
they don't realize is they can change

00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:59,189
that messaging so it's a handy tool it

00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,229
usually displays at the well in the

00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:02,699
storefront theme at the very bottom and

00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:05,699
we'll take a look at that example

00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:09,299
that's a nice unobtrusive way to kind of

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:12,389
have almost like a pop-up or a notice on

00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,829
all your pages about just about anything

00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,989
you need

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,699
and then again grouped products we've

00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:21,629
kind of touched on this we'll look at a

00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:25,169
more concrete example it's really just a

00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:27,660
nice way to create more pages that

00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:32,100
aren't necessarily just copies of an

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,479
existing product so if we look at so

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,850
here's the low stock notification

00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:38,429
example I basically just set I'm

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,910
managing stock on this project product

00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:45,629
I've only got 12 left I accept the

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:48,209
notice to to kind of use that phrasing

00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:50,699
of I only have 12 left to kind of create

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:53,939
that urgency and I hate to use this term

00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:57,629
but the fear of missing out a lot of

00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:59,399
times that will just push the customer

00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,689
over the edge to make that commitment to

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,809
start going through the conversion

00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:06,509
process and then again it just informs

00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:09,869
the customer so whether that's

00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:13,109
necessarily true or not you know you can

00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:15,869
fudge it a little bit but a lot of times

00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:18,119
if you're willing to do inventory

00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:22,879
management as part of kind of like the

00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:22,879
workflow this can be a helpful tool

00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:29,429
here's the store notice so you can see

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:31,319
down below you can just access this in

00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:34,889
the customizer turn it on and even

00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:38,939
schedule it so I set up a coupon that's

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,350
gonna go live at midnight tonight and

00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:42,089
then I can also set the store

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,279
notification to go live at midnight

00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,970
tonight and I just informed my customers

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:51,989
hey you save 25% this week on t-shirts

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,830
only that will automatically add it's

00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:55,839
nice and unobtrusive

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,320
unlike kind of a third party plug-in

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:03,120
where you might use a pop-up in fact

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:07,029
Google kind of likes using these low bar

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,329
like at the bottom of the page displays

00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,920
as opposed to pop-ups because yeah they

00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:14,050
will ding you especially on mobile

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,779
taking over somebody's screen with a

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,880
full pop-up will kind of hurt the mobile

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,070
experience and could potentially hurt

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,430
your search score and this is right in

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,920
core and unobtrusive follows those

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,870
guidelines and you can really have it

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,490
say anything and a lot of paired with a

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,890
couple other extensions if you get any

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,200
ones from like the WooCommerce

00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:45,070
marketplace it's an extremely powerful

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:49,420
tool and then store are saying it I made

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:52,690
a typo grouped products so it's more

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,390
products more revenue an additional

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,459
landing page so all of these products

00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,860
have their own landing page essentially

00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,750
their own product page I'm getting

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,930
surfed traffic to those additionally I

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:08,020
can with some minor content tweaks

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,820
promote those products as a group item

00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,579
so now I have another landing page that

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll hopefully appear in SERPs if

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:18,220
somebody searches you know for my smiley

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,870
face beanie a smiley face beanie I'll

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,850
come up first and then this group

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,550
product will come up second so are you

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,130
just getting more spaces in those search

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,290
results and hopefully streamlining the

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:35,770
process for customers to buy more from

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:39,010
you and these ones are a bit more

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,180
utilized and understood but I think

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,270
they're not always used to their full

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:47,350
potential is sales coupons and free

00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:50,170
shipping so sale prices can be set on

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,709
the product level and it's just a simple

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,899
sale of it was this price it's now this

00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:58,839
price and you can schedule them both to

00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:02,890
start and stop it's an extremely handy

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:05,140
tool coupons coupons can get pretty

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,880
complicated and be kind of daunting but

00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,910
out of the box

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,950
Commerce offers a lot of simple coupon

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,290
interactions and these can be used just

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,440
to nudge people to kind of get through

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:21,160
and do those conversions and then last

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,190
but not least free shipping generally

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,280
you set this free shipping as an option

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,930
either with a coupon and a minimum spend

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,510
or a coupon or just a minimum spend I

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:37,420
find using it offering it with just the

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,640
minimum spend is astronomical and

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,340
helping you push people to buy more and

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,320
hit that like mark for the free shipping

00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,990
so we'll look at a couple of quick

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,110
examples of that so these products are

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:53,770
on sale as you can see they're tagged

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,870
with the little sale tag next to it and

00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,960
then you have the visual of like it was

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,850
this price now it's this price this can

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,980
help people think well I'm getting a

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,320
great deal I've got our pounce on it now

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,840
if you tie this in to with the store

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,310
notice so you're saying like sale on all

00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,850
t-shirts you don't even need a coupon

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:15,340
just go to the t-shirt category and

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,620
you'll see everything's on sale this

00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:23,920
week only so you then created kind of

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:25,510
that fear of missing out and just you've

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,850
kind of presented it out of that lower

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:31,810
price point so they better hop on the

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:34,270
deal additionally to there are like

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:37,510
short code aspects to this so like in

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:40,510
this example I've created a page I've

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,910
used the sale shortcode so basically

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,910
this page will show everything on my

00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,130
site that is on sale and that is a great

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:51,160
tool to set up and then you can just be

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:53,050
like I'll run a PPC campaign just drive

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:58,260
all my traffic to my sale product and

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,260
get rid of all my overstock items so

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:08,829
coupons so again everyone loves the deal

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:10,510
you can set these again kind of in

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,270
tandem with the store notification I

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,220
think they help create kind of that fear

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,530
of missing out the opportunity for a

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,850
deal and can get you just to push people

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:24,140
to make that commitment

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:26,690
in purchasing the product they can also

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,330
help you kind of if you have overstock

00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:32,300
items kind of similar to sales just

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,910
deplete those items the added benefit to

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,800
these over sales is there's a lot of

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,750
tracking demographics to it too as

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,060
you're asking kind of users to do that

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,210
other step that allows you to kind of

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,790
track okay I gave them this extra task

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,230
they're willing to do it for it and then

00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,050
you can kind of see kind of that

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:54,970
penetration of all the promotion for

00:17:51,050 --> 00:18:00,520
that coupon and how effective it was and

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,520
then last but not least free shipping

00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,970
using it with the coupon is a good

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,160
option I think though using it with just

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,920
the minimum spend is the way to go if

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,720
you can swing it and you probably could

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,940
depending on where you set the free

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,920
shipping threshold you just eat that

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,260
shipping cost but you know if you can

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,250
push somebody spend $100 on your site

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:24,380
they should more than make up for it

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:27,350
should be on to use it's really just

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:30,530
kind of moral logistical question if you

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:34,960
can swing it or not but it's an

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,960
extremely helpful tool to get people to

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,440
places place all and they realize

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,320
they're just there it's not costing

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:56,530
everybody

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:58,810
oh yeah yeah that's perfect especially

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,630
two if you can do that nice pricing math

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:05,710
of to get over a hundred you're actually

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,900
a hundred and five but it's again a

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,510
extremely helpful tool and everyone

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:14,110
loves the deal and also with the culture

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,540
of kind of Amazon Prime it's almost like

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,330
you need to offer it at this point so it

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:24,220
might not be today but everyone wants

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:25,720
free shipping so so yeah just some quick

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,410
final thoughts to kind of wrap up

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:32,050
everything all these items were just in

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,540
commerce for so if you have no other

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:36,610
plugins installed you can go and have a

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,580
low commerce site set up you can go home

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,140
today and start enacting all these

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,960
changes

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:47,050
additionally WooCommerce documentation

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,350
is excellent they have a lot on store

00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,780
managing using all these core features

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:56,110
kind of use case examples just about

00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:58,360
everything you need so in these slides

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,520
to anything that's been underlined is a

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:06,160
link to the documentation for that item

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:07,570
as well and I would just say explore

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,910
your own site settings and themes

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,920
there's a lot in there it's a lot to

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,500
take in but you know just go through

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,530
everything understanding kind of like

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,630
the settings and the status reports will

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,660
just help you improve your business more

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,950
and more and that's kind of like a bonus

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,570
thing I know a lot of people like to use

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,520
third-party plugins I would strongly

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:35,320
suggest checking out the evil commerce

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:37,120
marketplace those ones so like if it's

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,010
in the dot-org repository it has gone

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,300
through a vetting process if it's in the

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:45,220
WooCommerce extension marketplace it's

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,850
gone through a more extensive vetting

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:51,160
process additionally it does cost money

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,080
but it's kind of a scenario you get what

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,660
you pay for so if you're getting a free

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,140
third-party plug-in or just be weary of

00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,320
you know

00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,030
how much they're gonna support it and if

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,720
it's gonna actually do what you want

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:07,880
again don't try it out if it works

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,410
perfect great go with it but I would

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,190
definitely check out the who commerce

00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:14,450
extensions because a couple of those

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,830
combined with these core features and

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:21,530
you can really get your site plumbing so

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:24,130
thank you very much and there any

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,130
questions

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,349
[Music]

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:52,760
the reason I'm here is I'm wondering who

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:57,370
could help them I first and I'm not sure

00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,370
as far as how specific

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:09,720
so that's kind of a interesting question

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:13,710
so you can do a lot with variable

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,799
products I will say there is an issue

00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:19,440
with them as you add more options it

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,080
gets exponentially more complicated so

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,850
like with this shirt example if I offer

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,999
at a shirt and small medium large that's

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:29,549
three sub products under that if I also

00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:31,889
offer it in red green or blue that's now

00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:35,570
six and then you're gonna just keep

00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:38,850
multiplying and multiplying there is a

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:43,470
theoretical limit to how many sub

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,460
variations you can have so some things

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,940
to look at

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,700
I would say outside of core you can look

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,700
in the e-commerce marketplace and

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:58,610
depending on how customizable the items

00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:02,789
are you could look at a couple of I

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,799
would Google like e-commerce route or

00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:07,309
clustered products they have a couple

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:12,330
extensions like chain products

00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:18,899
mix-and-match products and component

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:20,970
products additionally to there is a I

00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:25,830
don't know if your work with gravity

00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:29,039
forms gravity forms is a plate form yeah

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:32,190
so it's a paid form plug-in but I think

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:37,830
it's worth its weight that can actually

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:40,559
be attached with a WooCommerce plugin so

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,360
you can essentially it's usually used

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,210
for products so like if I was selling

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,330
your ring I can have a gravity form

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,919
added to the product page to say what

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,230
would you like engraved on it and then I

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,570
then have a text field and that text

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,909
field then gets added to kind of the

00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,909
order meta so as the order goes through

00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:01,690
I then know on the ring I need to print

00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:05,530
like love forever and ever

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:08,710
or something so those are a couple

00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:13,360
resources I would check out additionally

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:17,650
to I would just mess around with the

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:21,910
different attributes and see if you can

00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:30,030
just get it as a straight variable

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:30,030
product any other questions yeah

00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:38,510
those options you piloted more traffic

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:08,780
um yeah I mean so if you have like super

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,179
high stock levels that are not gonna run

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,490
out you can kind of synthetically so

00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:15,320
just say like I only have a hundred left

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,740
in a display I only have a hundred left

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,230
the one issue with that and there is a

00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,770
setting for this too is I would set up

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,630
low stock notifications there's another

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,390
notification setting to basically say

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:32,059
when this product is getting low and it

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:34,159
hits this threshold email me so that way

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:36,110
you know you've kind of synthetically

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,210
said you have a low stock so you say I

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,370
only have a hundred of these left as it

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,200
starts draining it'll kind of create

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:44,539
more of that buzz and that fear of

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,030
missing out and then realistically I

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:49,250
still have 200 and back so once it hits

00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,260
that threshold I then pump it back up

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,090
and you know it's kind of a standard

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,320
business practice because it's like you

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,320
just got more in so

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,190
yes

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,830
and

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:36,030
possibly I mean the biggest I find the

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,510
biggest pain points with running an

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:46,590
e-commerce site is taxes and shipping

00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:49,200
because it's just yeah yeah so I would

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,900
think it might just be kind of a deep

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,240
dive into kind of the UPS documentation

00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,240
and reviewing the settings

00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,770
any other question

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:12,030
cool I think we finished in just the

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:14,360
right amount of time a side for some

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,360
