[Applause]

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,900
I know this feeling

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,640
who here would like to make 250 bucks

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:24,100
give me a price to wrap my Honda you

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:27,490
came back with these screws so I want to

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:35,859
draw your attention to my tag line ed

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:37,689
evasion calm because everyone wouldn't

00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:40,869
it be funny if I do a big black line

00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:43,359
through me and put needs and then drove

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,939
around town I thought about it for a

00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,819
couple seconds I thought no because this

00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:51,429
point the buck stops here and I need

00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:55,040
people to have confidence that I am the

00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:58,009
good editor right in spot a typo

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,820
this is a two thousand dollar contract

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:05,630
how long would it have taken that person

00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,740
to review his work I can't relate about

00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:13,489
eight seconds

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:16,069
my friend comes out to 250 bucks they

00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,800
lost my business by not taking that time

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:21,290
and proofing my work if I tell you what

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,540
anybody's work at that would be an

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,550
editor so what happens when you go

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,800
through your work and you put in good

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:38,720
work online for a client and there's a

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:40,880
pretty tight bow on the first page you

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,550
can't track someone think about who

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,870
doesn't this guy wasn't super excited

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,660
she claims that she's the wordpress

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,600
advisor but if she can't spell word

00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:54,530
advisor how much confidence do I have in

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,200
her ability would I pay her to give me

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,670
the wisdom if she can't so word and buy

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,579
it does he put her stuff there spell

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,900
check give me a break so what we're

00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:05,329
gonna do today that we're talk to you

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,310
about excellence I'm not gonna talk to

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,940
you about perfection because this is a

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,670
place where you can be perfect just by

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,820
the big guy upstairs you can't carve out

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,140
perfection in your written words and I

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:24,079
wanted you all to take a deep breath

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,030
relax a little bit Tory got Serena

00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,980
Williams almost serene Williams she's

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:32,209
been dominant and winners

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,340
quite a while now - your question which

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,239
will be playing its first steps on the

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,049
tennis court

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:43,280
do you think she cared about the width

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:45,799
of the court the height of the net the

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,129
length of the racquet were the size the

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,680
ball I contracted here geez if she

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,269
didn't get boosted second clock she was

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,129
there to play tennis she was probably

00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,780
thinking about her create topspin lob

00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,480
but she didn't care about the

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,000
fundamentals the foundation that creates

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,549
the game of tennis because three bullets

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,890
no but if you change one of those things

00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:09,440
you can change the link the height the

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:18,949
width or the size you might be playing

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:22,340
game but you're not play top 12 things

00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:22,669
you need to know about in American

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,620
English

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,400
these are the fundation foundational

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:33,400
fundamental things where there is no

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,400
discussion any question

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,970
[Music]

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:04,629
[Music]

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,640
our

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,010
just keep unit flow through it

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,440
I'd like to see to get through but you

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,470
can't not to work we're going to go over

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,420
the material in this quiz and then we're

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,760
going to take a second quiz because

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,020
studies have shown that people retain

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:27,090
new information 87 percent more if

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,800
they're retested on new information we

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,570
meet with following the first time you

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,550
order we're going to take a second quiz

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,560
and I'm going to blow your hair back as

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,740
you can have a lot of time the four

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,740
minutes turn right now let's say

00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:16,009
strange we all know this

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,600
I want to redo this

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:56,430
it is so you've got I can punch of us

00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:01,980
person IPS we were going to tell me what

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:07,950
IP box BS means it also means it's a

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:09,839
contraction so that now is IPS boy that

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,420
trips me up all the time

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,550
it really does but fortunately I always

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,350
do searches if I'm doing wrong - I was

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,940
researching for votes if some um some

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,370
big spellcheck is not going to catch

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,050
that might be blue London ain't gonna

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,690
give you a redline consistent real word

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,120
so make sure that you know in your heart

00:11:24,690 --> 00:12:23,940
in your soul in your bones that this

00:11:27,120 --> 00:12:31,020
rule is very important to you or a

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:35,339
plural pronoun the never here is site

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:38,550
builder site builder site builders site

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:42,060

their car you have to say in his or her

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:50,100
path or the easy work around this site

builders floral sites builders that's

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,000
pretty easy

00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,839
no it's not no it's not it's it's

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,939
there's move towards that and British

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,139
English and British English is actually

00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:09,059
okay but the last time I looked

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:10,619
I'm standing in the United States and if

00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,379
you want to connect with people quickly

00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:33,499
and efficiently through your writing you

00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:33,499
need to write like them so English

00:13:36,379 --> 00:14:05,459
American English if you are right and

00:13:49,230 --> 00:14:08,549
there is an agreement that's the most

00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:13,949
real team of any hosting company they

00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:17,160
know their craft the first group of

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:19,819
people have seen your name you are my

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,819
audience

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,489
[Music]

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,100
[Music]

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,369
[Music]

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:03,620
Peter surely likes to drink wine loosen

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,550
ball so Baltimore Maryland with her

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,550
husband and two dogs

00:17:17,940 --> 00:18:56,960
it's completely okay we use a lot why

00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:01,370
not set up

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm watching faces on both of those

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,380
here's a here's another sentence number

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,150
eight

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,540
someone's looking to get my business

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:13,010
because they have testimonial on your

00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:15,330
website but that worked by posting

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:20,070
problem with this sentences they put a

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:24,630
hyphen in fully the image never put a -

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:26,400
after ly adverb never and unfortunately

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,880
it sounds so right it sounded like it

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,480
should be joined but you never put an ly

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,230
adverb after you mean you've never - 8 +

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,300
ly adverb the 16-track because of that

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,300
one part the punctuation because of that

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,210
yeah I remember the sentence prior to

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,700
that is so I have to go back and look

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:57,270
but for this for our purposes the

00:19:50,700 --> 00:20:00,450
problem is the C - answer the question

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:03,180
was they've been a perfect fit so Gigi

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,830
was asking about bag and because I don't

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,300
have two preceding sentence in there to

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,250
see if she was talking about a teen or a

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,970
company or whatever we don't know

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,230
whether name is used correctly okay

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:18,720

off the rails about catherization

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,620
client who wanted to capitalize the word

00:20:24,150 --> 00:21:30,830
visitors he thinks he honors visitors

00:20:27,620 --> 00:21:40,580
I rule in this situation absolutely

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:47,720
should have been capitalized 11 are we

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:50,270
going to 11 oh I see this a lot EEG is

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,620
always oh it's always always followed by

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:56,059
a comma

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:59,630
no exceptions whatsoever I need an eg

00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:01,080
always follow I promise now etc you know

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,340

each he needs for example there's a lot

00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:32,460
right now he's an example starting to

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:38,369
sing they like so eg for example and

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:49,919
IEDs storm in other words so I in other

00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:53,309
words how I keep them straight I love

the whole thing pretty quality content

00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:57,539
that engages the customer and is also

00:22:55,169 --> 00:23:00,539
keyword rich while we're training the

00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:05,220
branding of your company is e to having

a successful website now I'm gonna hire

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,710
somebody writes this itself accessible

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,389
and you know something else

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,539
they just bother to put it in word

00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:17,759
because these are both red wine red wine

00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:19,739
which they cannot be published and yet I

00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,009
pop them right off a WordPress

00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:28,429
developers website would I hire that

00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:28,429
person $50

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:51,140
respect these here we have two sentences

00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:55,670
with what are called prominence a

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:57,950
homonym is oh so nice actually that are

00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:01,400
spelt differently mean different things

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,320
but are pronounced the same okay so if

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,490
you're thinking your words and you're

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,590
not paying attention you're spelling

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:11,300
you've got to be careful because the

00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:13,760
first the person is your eye in visual

00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,830
design is only due to the context of

insurance car insurance boat insurance

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,710
motorcycle insurance we need any shoe

well no it doesn't really work about

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:34,640
sentence context it's not it's not quite

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,860
work should be I'm sure under the heat

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:48,320
see those who have spell peak the way

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:52,220
this needs to be so somebody wasn't

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,660
paying attention because it's right but

00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:58,730
it's not alright this is a little deep

00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,809
thoughts I earned only eat dive overlap

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:04,370
myself for my three minute boot camp

00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,600
okay I'm gonna talk about quotation

00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,250
marks that see them all over the place

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,429
today and our team all over the place

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,559
American in WordPress sites and this is

00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:16,760
America we've already discussed it so

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:19,539
I'm going to look at 1560 and 1563 now

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,779
okay when you are in America

00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:25,179
you are writing for Americans you always

00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:27,340
meet with double quotes and I will tell

00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,899
you what there are no exception to this

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,269
none of these things actually I'm

00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:39,999
talking about today

00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:42,399
exception once I said oh we got the

00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:44,739
signal books we might be writing for a

00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,159
British audience but you are incorrect

00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:49,029
or American oh so you gotta have two

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:59,619
double quotes

00:25:49,029 --> 00:26:02,109
once I saw leave you have rotation works

00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:04,239
they are always placed outside periods

00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:07,149
of problems and I need always note

00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:10,929
session always periods commas quotation

00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:13,619
marks are outside semicolons and colons

00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:16,869
the quotation marks of inside and

00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:19,330
question marks and exclamation points

00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:21,369
depend on the context of the sentence

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,049
but just don't worry about that way you

00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:25,210
know what we're talking about periods

00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,979
and commas quotation marks double

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,769
quotation marks single quotation work

00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:32,499
publication work outside periods and

00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:35,820
commas yeah this is really interesting

00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:35,820
oh yeah cathartic said all this

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:45,360
family anyway really is wrong on some

00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,490
accounts here's one of them we're really

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,300
sad it's that quotation mark Thomas have

00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,300
to be in pairs

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:58,440
all these appears no no no no I want you

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,600
poor thing you know who you happen to

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,300
want on your shelf and I want to notice

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,910
that meet you be into a you know your

00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,100
character speaks into a second pair wrap

00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:14,850
there it is million quote which means

00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:18,540
they're not appears alright look at 17

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:20,190
this is something I made up I'm talking

00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,140
about the rule of paw because it tells

00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:34,860
you when you need to use quotation marks

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:38,010
and use italics alright

00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:41,540
we do have used to be in my trial record

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:46,740
album okay but the newspaper a magazine

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:49,410
divided the pot a pot the pot itself is

00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,690
put into the towers so the New York

00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:54,180
Times is in italics the pieces of the

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,550
pie are in quotation marks so the

00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,170
article in The New York Times is in

00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,440
quotation marks but the New York Times

00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,540
is in italics the article the magazine

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,670
the song title those pieces those

00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,550
divisions of the pie are in quotation

00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:11,580
marks but the record album title is in

00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:14,070
italics so when you say that you've

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,600
invented the internet doesn't really

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,310
sound like I have a lot of infamy

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,330
because how I mentioned

00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:23,430
should be in italics italics now if you

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,250
talk about those I didn't stick with us

00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,750
and somehow - he ate and ate did not

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,680
show up but there are two correct ways

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:34,410
to show time in American English the

00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:38,040
first one is to use lowercase no spaces

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:43,200
but periods you always have mister 3:30

00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:46,560
space a period mm period or I don't want

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,290
to use top of the hour colon zero zero

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:53,460
in that clutters my throws so i'll just

00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:56,310
say for space lowercase P period

00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,980
lowercase M period that's how you can do

00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:01,260
that one style the other ways other

00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,390
cases you know period there's always in

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:06,090
these space between your number and

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:09,210
you're paying or Peter Pan you see that

00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:14,210
mistake a lot we have everything correct

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:23,970
yet nineteen here's some sloppy writing

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:27,960
this led to liam transition there this

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:31,470
led to Liam's transition from a career

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,480
or be so Liam transitioning from career

00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:37,710
but Leah's did not Church trans

00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,580
transition from a career we want careful

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:44,360
edits

00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:50,100
careful with talkback and there between

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:54,320
our marquee programs are what may be are

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,320
a re but they're not

00:29:59,960 --> 00:31:32,429
this is something really speak in this

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:36,059
prose is when you speak I guarantee you

00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:37,859
my this is the joy of being an editor

00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,749
because it just comes up and slash

00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:42,539
upside the head

00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:43,830
no no I'm sorry there's anything up in

00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:52,799
the heaven like that's an idea when you

00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:54,090
do not want me to but you know something

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:59,249
ladies that's not it

00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:11,580
that's just me okay I'll say well 15 16

00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:13,109
17 is where we got directional two

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,999
different kinds of directional and we

00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:19,109
got one right another direction

00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:23,489
oh that is not good writing

00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:26,789
you must pass title you must establish a

00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:29,159
beachhead before you invade France and

00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:31,649
you would say that our style is going to

00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,869
be directional or non directional

00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:36,839
quotation marks he's going to establish

00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:38,820
a style saying this is our this is the

00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,190
way we're going to tell time and we're

00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,929
going to do it through out through out

00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,339
and they even change from client to

00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:48,559
client maybe one fight we'll have a

00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:51,330
preference but you must establish style

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,849
you really might otherwise write these

00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:56,960
with the all good place it's anybody you

00:32:53,849 --> 00:33:01,849
work for company that has a style guide

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,849
you got one man we've got two ladies

00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,799
that you all consider

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,860
your company needs to establish a tires

00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:26,140
on the side that is imposed on not only

00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:31,630
your material for your own website but

00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:34,210
for everybody else's correct system the

00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,970
consistency is where you find your

00:33:34,210 --> 00:34:32,890
excellence so here's a little bit closer

00:33:36,970 --> 00:34:34,139
to my conduct in this room a lot of

00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:37,249
things have changed

now you could actually put but I mean

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,910
you wouldn't come out wrapping like

00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:40,040
practices kirigi period premises no the

00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,240
whole string absolutely that's actually

00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:49,690
the best way to do it it's the most

00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:49,690
popular way is to put for example
