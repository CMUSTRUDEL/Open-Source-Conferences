Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Bangkok 2019
Description: 
	Dreb will go over the the importance and the process of code review in delivering a secured and performant WordPress powered sites. Heâ€™ll mainly touch on a few things such as what are the most common things to check or look for when you review code, ways to remediate potential flags or errors, and how we can simplify the code review process by taking advantage of several open-source tools.

let's get started welcome to this happen

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,170
in session but like I start you stuck by

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:32,610
me she's from our language come stai say

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:35,640
say it with me come stop poverty so at

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:41,270
least I tell you more about myself later

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:43,980
on so I hope you're all having fun and

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,739
you're very joining the word come so far

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,940
and we appreciate you guys thank you for

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,800
the joining us to this event today so

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,430
before anything else I'd like to

00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,449
introduce myself my name is my name is

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,260
Trevor I am a senior whether near a food

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:08,400
is fully distributed company called tena

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:11,430
I'm also how I meet up I also have

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,770
organized peanuts in my hometown in

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,020
Davao as we also have like we were

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,990
growing WordPress community groups in

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,000
there and I'm also trying to support the

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,080
WordPress user groups in the Philippines

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,420
and also I'd be partly involved with a

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:33,750
global community team of the open-source

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,530
WordPress project these afternoon are

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,630
you ready

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,570
so this appala I'd like to talk about

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,729
very important processes in our workflow

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,149
that is that's a site from sleepy also

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,409
right sometimes if you deploy your code

00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,719
so I like to eat on the very important

00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:55,719
in our club and should be for everyone

00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,780
when shipping and launching secured

00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:02,319
clean and perform at work past our sites

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:05,619
and this process is called the desert

00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:09,129
it's code review you would probably

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:12,129
start asking now what is the hope of you

00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:15,750
and why should you care about community

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:18,610
process let's simply look at the display

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,090
visiting a wordpress site may run

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,890
smoothly on a few visits but what if you

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,560
have a site or what if you are building

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,549
a site for enterprise level of sites or

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,840
sites that gets thousands or millions of

00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:37,750
pieces a day we besides like CNN or New

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,590
York Times or TechCrunch or even Voogd

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,010
you can name

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,650
so this type of size don't have work

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:48,819
though they cannot afford to go down

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:52,090
even for a few seconds so how are you

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,980
making sure ask their partner in the

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,630
degree of the best experience to their

00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,060
readers that you and other engineers or

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:04,450
developers working on a project

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:08,739
pollutant code that can scale and ready

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:12,040
for high-traffic situations that is what

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:15,069
code review comes in and that is the end

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,799
goal why it is very important to have a

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:24,510
code review process in place before you

00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:28,419
ship or deploy code Mario Keshav CEO of

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,180
Derek's is also an agency the similar to

00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:34,430
town

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:37,579
Millis endings large fortune large-scale

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:41,920
wordpress platforms he made this

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:45,409
statement that what makes a 500 dollar

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:50,359
project different from a twenty thousand

00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:52,700
one : quality when I read it I could not

00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:56,540
agree more to it I could not agree more

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,239
to a statement because being a partner

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,569
to you to your client that would mean

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,239
that we would have to go extra miles to

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,909
make sure that their that their business

00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,959
or that their business based online and

00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:15,190
running which actually we need extra

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,889
time and effort and resources as needed

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:23,780
there is no better way to make sure than

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:27,740
to check each other's work okay let's

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:31,520
feel why didn't you go to you and what

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,639
are you code reviewing on so there are a

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,909
couple of factors that you take into

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,639
considerations when or every time you

00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:44,389
send your code to your life site you

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,210
can't although you can't the point where

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,669
certain cases when you overlook certain

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,460
pieces of your code to go against these

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,270
factors and that's that's perfectly

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,610
normal

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,150
like we are Ubuntu into making stage

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:03,979
light so code review is meant to be your

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:09,259
Baca and allows us to less likely if not

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:13,159
at all cheap unwanted code so let's

00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:15,169
start first persevering becoming you

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,979
code review because you would want to

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:22,400
make sure your code is secured it is

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:26,900
very essential to keep the website since

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,850
the one is free just like how it is

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,880
like how sweet is to everyone's some

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:37,100
people are also free teas went for their

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:40,639
evil doings we have some preventive

00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,610
measures on your site this tactile size

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,590
would be that easy prey for the for

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,900
these hackers and their deparias

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:52,820
activities as a way to for example

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:56,180
verify that each new code that you push

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,940
stirs I would would it cost or does it

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:02,840
put aside a twist you would want to

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,889
check if data are sanitized out put our

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,710
escape data gets validated correctly

00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:11,690
nonces are in place and you pay extra

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:16,130
attention to you here is where you could

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:18,590
possibly do sequel injections oh man

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,050
actually I just hated the whole summary

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,720
of what to look for when we think about

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,580
security okay so let me back up and

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,780
let's start with some tightening and

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,349
speaking your data

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,650
that's the first item then so during

00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:36,470
your review you would check the inputs

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,639
these are the data that you take in from

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,710
the users they should be sanitized and

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,690
outputs these are all the data that you

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,419
would display back to your to the

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,320
browser version client browser they

00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:54,470
should all estate workbook provides a

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,050
number of api's depends on the type of

00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:01,370
data that you are trying to sanitize or

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:03,919
state such as sanitize text field for

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,430
your regular text field needs and

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:12,199
sanitize email or email while we have my

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:14,750
very favorite 1sp HTML for speaking for

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,360
generally removing extra special

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,919
characters from a string before you

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,349
display to the browser and you have

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,350
skate URL in this game each type should

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:28,460
be honest

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:31,680
you can use to sort of escape whatever

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,840
necessary characters that you want that

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,700
you would want that you would expect do

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:43,710
you have enough URLs training do include

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:48,270
review so to remove you know also flag

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:50,880
code that area validated it takes a

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,360
square for example we need to call WT

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,150
mail and we gotta make sure that the

00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,930
data analytics that we supply to the WP

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,880
mail call is actually indeed an email so

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,120
WordPress has this function is

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,650
underscore underscore email that you can

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,200
use to validate that use it than done

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:16,320
the good old piece be such as in the

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,990
list below the you know PHP has a number

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:24,360
of validation functions - such as he

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:26,550
said MT in array or count we are not in

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,120
short supply of this validation helper

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:33,810
so feel free to use them as a rule of

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,580
thumb it is very much preferable to over

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:42,030
validate than to under Molly

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:47,100
alright so move on to the nonce okay so

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:49,710
I see a corn or an action that allows a

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,950
user to process a certain piece of code

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,380
that you want introducing what I would

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,110
go straight into looking what would be

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:02,430
necessary requirements to allow them to

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:05,430
process the action my friend if if you

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,520
don't have any months in there I would

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:11,150
not let that code deploy because not

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,220
with basically that security guard in

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:16,240
order to in order for something to pass

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,410
you then you have to have

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,559
something that allow you to kinda like

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:27,309
process the request so in the WordPress

00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:29,079
language I'm not sure if you can see

00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:32,170
that theory but into that in the word

00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:35,350
miss language he use WP nonce field or

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,990
BB pigments so I'll go back here so that

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,649
the WP nonce field and that would be

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,929
create nos so these are the API that you

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:47,259
can use that will generate a token and

00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:52,029
then the other one is a WP very finance

00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:55,089
that is the API order that's why you can

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:59,829
use to verify the token that generated

00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:05,949
from the to ABI above so it might sample

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:09,869
here I'm not sure if you can see this so

00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:09,869
it's not beautiful enough sorry guys but

00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:16,800
so so for example the above example is

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,959
an unsafe way of like processing

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,910
something which doesn't have like a

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:26,290
check point and then here I've

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:29,230
highlighted in red there is a WP verify

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,869
on so meaning if you don't get that

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,040
token or the past then the whole thing

00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:39,699
here oh thank you so the whole thing

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:43,389
here gonna be skipped so you don't allow

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:47,019
this right here to be processed it is

00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,819
here so I call this area here the

00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:52,290
security guard so if you don't have the

00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:59,820
token if you don't have the pass then

00:10:52,290 --> 00:11:01,920
to go or to enter right so so yeah so

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,839
that would be an extra layer of security

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:10,680
in your code and lastly we pay extra

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:15,240
attention to to when things get into our

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,970
database so what the pdb prepare would

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:24,029
be a very useful man when there's a need

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:27,000
to run a custom database query and yes

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:31,440
oh i know you are trying to spin shut up

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,079
they go ahead a couple one two three

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,600
four five but don't worry because we

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,649
have a whole ton of info of a security

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,300
tape and sanitization and escapement and

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,420
validation and there are very much

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:52,440
available in WordPress support teams

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:56,420
clearly handbook it says being there but

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,850
these also apply to plug-in development

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:03,810
so I'll give you the list later as well

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,940
as slide the copy of the slide next for

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:10,170
four months you could give you because

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,610
you care about performance so you come

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,699
to you because you would want to make

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,800
sure your code is designed with

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:19,680
performance in mind if your code

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,410
optimized enough to endure and could

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,370
scale weather site it's the busiest time

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:28,920
of the day if not I would take a step

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,949
back and clock out the effective code I

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,579
would start checking if you are using

00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:38,839
any attached functions or requesting and

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:43,050
cached queries keep an eye or at least

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:47,660
for this several functions yet post-term

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,660
exists yet page by title

00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,509
current user host experienced that

00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:57,110
person how it could really hurt your

00:12:53,509 --> 00:13:00,829
site if you spot them in the code this

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:04,339
pattern should not go and - so if you

00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:07,279
will need to use them make sure you

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:09,679
catch them in your code so that next

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,869
week when it will just pull the copy

00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:20,329
from the cache all right

00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:23,809
so hope you can see this one how do you

00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:26,929
know how do you know they are catch well

00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:29,660
if you expect that a source code of the

00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:33,499
API you can see that for example the get

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:36,139
page by title it's running a database

00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:38,540
query that yet underscored by it

00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:43,009
underscore bar bars basically going to

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:46,309
run a Walkman so meaning that whenever

00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:48,910
you call it get paged by title is going

00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:52,600
to request directly to your database and

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:56,149
that is not scalable my friend so

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,610
another thing to look is if you're

00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:02,509
running more queries than what you need

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:06,199
for in case of a new tt query instance

00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:09,880
by passing some queries such as sending

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:12,339
no pound rose to true yeah

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,190
ooh that would skip the queries that

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:19,360
basically run to calculate the

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:22,240
pagination and setting the update post

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,329
meta cache and update poster tasks to

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,910
false will basically skip priming the

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:32,110
cache of the term and the meta of a

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:36,430
certain post those things although they

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:40,209
look small but they would go a long way

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:45,149
when it comes to thinking about the

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:48,069
performance of your site and yep I

00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:50,889
wouldn't let you get away with that

00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:53,889
request from a third party API without a

00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:58,959
connection in place certainly under

00:14:53,889 --> 00:15:03,430
watch and glas.t so we've got to the

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:07,149
security performance and lastly because

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:09,819
of readability you contribute because

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:12,220
you would want to make sure that code is

00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:15,040
formatted in a way that engineers and

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,310
developers with able to understand it

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,800
and engineers that will inhibit interior

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:24,220
project would be able to carry on

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:28,449
without much friction making it

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:32,769
developer friendly ask me well part of

00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:36,910
that is making their code readable it's

00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:39,630
very easy for like the use of like

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:44,529
flagging the use of space over tabs or

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:49,269
the user or not keeping your markup

00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:53,439
balanced with PHP blocks ok I know you

00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:59,350
feel me - when I say that who would want

00:15:53,439 --> 00:16:01,300
to work on with movies like this okay I

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,950
think we're good I can work with the

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,680
movies

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:10,589
yeah but our but I would estimate my

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,970
client with a crazy number of hours for

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:19,440
me to meet that what if you have a code

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:21,510
like this very much documented right so

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,870
this is the good thing about the core is

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,910
because this is an example from course

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,779
so that feeling when you have this kind

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,709
of existing project and it's so easy to

00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,470
understand

00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:38,250
rather than this project it will take me

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:42,600
a day just just to maybe understand a

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,940
few lines of code this one is like sorry

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,120
this is very really small but this one

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,250
right here are comments of the API and

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,899
then some arguments down though but they

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,389
are structured and for a minute in a way

00:16:51,899 --> 00:17:00,600
that's very readable from a developer's

00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:03,060
perspective thankfully we have we have

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,339
many generous people from the community

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,640
who put together coding standards that

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:12,449
we can all agree on this is our own

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,069
version of pixel-perfect code base so

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,500
imagine if we don't have polish brothers

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:23,480
in place in WordPress it's likely that

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,480
people would contribute more in so

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:31,770
how do you commit you I mean what can

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,590
you use and in what ways so there's

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:39,090
there's two ways in how we can do code

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:44,480
review the first one automatic has in 1t

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:47,820
and man I'll review among other tools

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,880
PHP code sniffer is very popular out

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,820
there for automating this process PHP

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,690
code zipper so anyone familiar with PHP

00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:01,700
code sniffer

00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:05,240
wait oh oh all right

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:08,870
attack violation of a device setup code

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,149
inspectors and good news there's even a

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,299
collection of PHP code sniffers that

00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:17,389
co-sleeper standards for WordPress

00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:21,529
so you can download and read a lock it's

00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:24,889
github repo and it's open source as

00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:25,639
always so yeah I'll give you the

00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:27,769
call later

00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:29,929
I'll change you can see but it says

00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:32,470
WordPress codex Panthers WordPress Cody

00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:37,940
Saunders if you search that Google would

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:41,059
lead you to way so when money HP code

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:47,480
sniffer with WordPress Thunder this is a

00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:49,639
video alright so this is a example so

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,450
when one English becomes deeper with our

00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:56,419
quest standards it scans the code cache

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,529
common security issues like missing

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:04,370
input sanitization output escaping

00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:07,190
missing nonce checkpoints etc and

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,559
actually even validate that that

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,200
everything's well documented for example

00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:18,279
image you stack or you miss a couple of

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:22,909
tags so in example I here

00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:26,179
so there are issues when expected one

00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:30,350
space before closing a bracket so it's

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:34,070
also so found like some sort of

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,220
formatting issues and then I'm

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:40,059
highlighted here

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,850
so rusting form the rusty form data we

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:45,340
have nonspecific Asia and thirst the

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,070
lion has acceded to the left far left of

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,289
that there's the line is the line of the

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:55,950
code so you can't expect and go and find

00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:55,950
a file and do the cesarean changes

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,989
and you can also

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,659
libertage continues integrations or

00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:20,549
known as CI that the drama piece piece

00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:23,129
needs to be co-sleeping in the

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:25,919
background or any custom screen or

00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:28,830
however you are connected in so long as

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,679
it allows you to automate the process of

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,259
code review team that would be for sir

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,340
uses PHP code sniffer to but it's more

00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:40,889
of like a another way is manual

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,230
review but most of the time you would

00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:46,649
want an automatic customized welcome

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:50,190
both code review setup because in that

00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:53,249
way that would be very very effective so

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,139
there are tools that would allow you to

00:20:53,249 --> 00:21:00,659
conveniently you in code review or

00:20:55,139 --> 00:21:03,899
Unicode changes such as beatstock

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:09,359
anybody who are who have used this or

00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:11,249
have been using it lab you have the

00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,470
pocket what other tools you're using in

00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:19,830
your workflow or in code reviewing if

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:25,009
you guys have already give mom okay

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,009
perfect we also use a little high

00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:37,769
alright so so for instance it has this

00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:40,409
very beautiful UI and it allows you to

00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:43,649
comment on the line of code wherein you

00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:46,380
can provide feedback or even suggest a

00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:52,070
bad way that's more in line with the

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:52,070
I suppose with you for example I spot a

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:59,580
user input and then you trust and the

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,270
sort that is based but you didn't have

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,310
any sanitization in place then I would

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,860
like to point the for example I will

00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,780
point the light code then there would be

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:15,980
like a pop-up on that'll allow you to

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:15,980
track comments not sure you can see here

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:30,000
Matt will be resources on us peer code

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:33,170
review as it goes in to ace when we new

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,780
code that others have written number two

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:41,010
when when you have their code reviewed

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:44,610
by your team and the best thing you will

00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:47,730
learn a lot in the process there is no

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:50,130
better and fastest way to grow than to

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,260
learn from your past mistakes and you

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,390
learn and you will experience this that

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,990
you will you have tons of experience

00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,750
about it in the code review phase and of

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,660
course you can definitely do some review

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,790
as well and if you're using gifts I know

00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,060
a lot of speakers are talking about

00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:13,200
gifts and I hope you're all the room you

00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:15,330
know yeah which I think the case that

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,230
would make it even more easier for you

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,690
to code to sell code review so we have

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,950
source tree I used to

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:29,330
a working machine as well as github for

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:35,299
desktop or you can solve it by your if

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:37,549
you're using some web text editor so

00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:40,609
even in our reference English system

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:43,489
code review plays a very vital role in

00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:46,570
keeping a state and help the platform

00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:49,279
for everyone earlier this afternoon

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:53,889
there was a great talk about making her

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,929
theme on worker support standards so

00:23:53,889 --> 00:24:00,200
better job there in explaining what

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:02,149
process goes into reviewing a P so I

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,820
hope you didn't he said what and if you

00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:07,039
did there would be a we played a

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:13,700
recording of that video in WordPress

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:15,559
that TV so astronauts philosophy goes we

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,509
should not take shortcuts that

00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:21,139
compromise the end you the end

00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:23,779
experience for the user that being said

00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:27,289
we have to make sure you review our code

00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,599
and they find that we follow as an

00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:31,669
engineer of the site we follow the

00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,409
wordpress code expanders and the

00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:35,749
engineering best practices that the

00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,200
community have helped to made over the

00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:39,019
years

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,320
so here the Tanakh has an engineering

00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:45,080
best practices and we always check the

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,349
code against these practices and make

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,080
sure that the new changes follows

00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:55,309
whatever whatever is here along with the

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:58,759
word press release letters we are well

00:24:55,309 --> 00:25:01,779
on our way to dominate web actually we

00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:05,570
aren't 33% of what you see lead to him

00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:09,259
let's meet Alex how villain we have to

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:12,580
be a better place to making to make sure

00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:15,940
we ship well engineered

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:20,020
and once that is doing that is to make

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:23,290
could be part of your engineers DNA or a

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:26,680
developer DNA or better yet make it part

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:29,799
of your team culture thank you very much

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,799
