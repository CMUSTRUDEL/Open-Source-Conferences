you so many teams on what they start out

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,230
mainly will focus on this thing is

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,990
really how we can proceed how you can

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,460

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:30,190
is really you may have these questions

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,250

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,590
course your team must be in what place

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,110
dot are these standards your team must

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,570
follow the what they started guidelines

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,640
otherwise your team will not get

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,650
approved and you are planning to

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,590
contribute as a theme reviewer you need

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,750
to know this guidelines of what they

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,370
start up teams you may have contributed

in documentation you may have

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,750

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,190
rwby session so i think this session

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,080
will be very beneficial if you are

tried reading teams or good you did love

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,330
mayor actually they're both team for

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:44,260
wordpress.org or something like that

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:46,090
yeah just for crimes that means are you

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,580
properly follow the coding standard of

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:55,630
world peace or something or not you need

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:58,900
okay okay maybe maybe of condensation

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:04,390
from the next day I think you will do

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:06,340
these practices as well now if you are

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:10,390
capable or if you are if you are

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:13,209
planning to start a team review set up

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,489
team develop in environment first you

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,019
need to make the environment to develop

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,959
team and you need to make the

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:23,980
environment to review things first how

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:27,610
we can in your in your WordPress files

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,470
debug to interview be convicted because

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,530
it shows the inner hand warning while

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,360
developing teams are while living teams

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:40,060
check this file probably considered PSP

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:43,270
and enable de devote to mode and import

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,460
demo data from those import because even

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,580
imported this demos data so that you can

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,440
check the line mean the design how the

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,810
post looks how the page looks for that

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,540
this is beneficial to check the design

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,430
proposed so if you review teams are if

00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,170
you developing team without the demo

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:04,330
content I think it's not easy to see the

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,480
layout and the look so this is very

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:11,290
important for you and we have three

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,940
plugins they just--they mod it and this

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,190
is thin check and this is thinness

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,590
Nepali this thin checked bag easy

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,520
plug-in is available in wordpress.org

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,950
repository

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,170
what is this thin sniffer and team audit

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,450
are on in github you can download those

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,000
problems from github and install it on

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:32,170
your local environment and then you can

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,480
start reading themes just install these

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,420
three plugins these three plugins will

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,220
help you to start reading and this

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,040
problems holes will show you lots of

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,210
issues is delay just you can install

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,190
this and you can check inside a

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,840
appearance and then Tim check RT mod it

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,530
just you can click and steady the themes

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,940
all the readers warning notices will

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:56,050
display there and you need to check them

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,270
all the notice the warnings shown by

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,020
these problems are just a recommended

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:05,320
part is recommended to solve them

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,690
however those required things are alert

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,030
and required things need to be solve

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,640
otherwise you will not get approval what

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,740
this total maybe your River will close

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:20,200
your team instantly or he will seduce

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:21,910
you to solve this is use now what are

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,300
the things standards what your team

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,830
should have you need to know if you are

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,630
planning to develop themes or if you are

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,170
trying to review the themes you need to

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,850
know these things what are the standards

00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,190
what are the standard that you need to

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,950
worry while developing

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,020
while living things now your team must

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,020
be GPL compatible how many of you are

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,530
aware about this license GPL license no

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:51,940
general public license you know yeah

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:54,250
GPL because what this is totally gpo

00:06:51,940 --> 00:07:00,250
even parlance even themes everything in

00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:04,090
workplaces CDL and this thing is also

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,460
GPL all the images all the libraries for

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:11,500
example the CSS whatever you use in

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:14,440
theme it must be GPL this for example if

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,020
you are using images in your theme that

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,690
must be GPL GPL compatible for example

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,820
cc0 license MIT license are those GPL

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,070
compatible license for example if you

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,900
randomly Google as image and if you put

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:30,550
each in your thing that is not allowed

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:33,160
and there are lots of free images sites

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:37,000
like pixel a unsplash and what if pixels

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,230
and lots of themes but there are

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,090
frequently change their license for

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,810
example pics away of a recently since

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:46,660
their license and now it's not working

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,430
fine and so using images of fixed array

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,140
is not allowed and using images of ones

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,260
place is not allowed even they are free

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,410
but they are not GPL compatible so you

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,180
need to check or the handbook of

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,370
Henryville thailand teen violence and UK

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,460
there are few with such solution you can

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:06,400
download the images from there means you

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,620
need to check the images or library or

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,550
what whatever you are using in him that

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:15,580
must be GPL compatible and the theme

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,860
must be either free and secure if your

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,780
theme is with errors if your theme so

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,880
the warning if your theme so the notices

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,470
that is strictly prohibited that is

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,750
totally not allowed in what they start

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,210
out so while developing team I already

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,640
told you that you need to enable your

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,900
setup environment that is debug true so

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,539
that it will show the warning and

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,150
nutritious so theme must be either free

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,570
and secure if there are some malicious

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,430
things in theme that is not allowed it

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,220
must be a warning and notices are not

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,660
allowed you can use unique prefix reduce

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,879
conflicts with problems

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,629
if your team has the unique slog if you

00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,910
if your thing is thin name is unique and

00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:57,850
it will not country with the plugin so

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,579
always use the unique name not general

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,629
random name because there are more than

00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:06,850
6,000 cause teams have submitted in

00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:10,959
WordPress startup and among them around

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:13,180
4 or 5,000 I would like and if you

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,279
submit those names it will not operate

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,189
in WordPress turtle so always change the

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,199
random name unique name whatever and

00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:22,360
your team must with translation ready

00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:25,930
because today we are in another country

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,170
and lots of audience may not know that

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,000
but in this language so your theme must

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,949
be translation ready if your team is not

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,660
translation ready not translation ready

00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:38,019
it will not approve in WordPress

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,939
Tata so theme must be translation ready

00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,759
this is the important required things

00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:43,449
for workplace themes no morally

00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,550
offensive

00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,990
for example maker theme which is perfect

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,569
everyone who want to use it

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,839
never use open system is or any

00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:55,569
resources because you don't allow to use

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,610
image that may not show it to the proper

00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:00,160
society or something like that so your

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,079
theme must be present your thing must be

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,790
suitable for everyone who want to use a

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,680
theme because what storage is totally

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,019
free and everyone can visit the website

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,480
download the theme and they need to use

00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:13,689
it but if your thing is offensive like

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,970
that so it is not allowed so we never

00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:19,180
approve those themes when neighbor said

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:22,329
like those things and if anyone any

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:26,759
author did those things we totally

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:26,759
banned in theme or suspend those things

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:35,920
now important things to take care about

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,420
in this team development while team

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,490
development or while committing what are

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,769
the important things for example team

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,930
has the primary file like standard CSS

00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:47,079
functions that PHP something like that

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:51,430
if your team for example if your team

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:54,630
name is 2017 III pass it here a snap

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:58,660
sort of this skin sort of the 2017 T

00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:01,060
teen named 2017 and here is what takes

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,670
to - 2017

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:07,170
for example if your team has towards

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:11,430
like 20 is specify engine you can write

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:15,100
text on in like this or you can put -

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:17,920
inside the 20 - 17 that are the things

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,589
you need to care about for example if

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,870
your team name is Bangkok your text

00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:25,750
domain name is Bangkok and your team

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,959
color name must be bankers if your team

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,569
name is Bangkok Tokyo then you can your

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,630
folder name must be Bangkok - Tokyo or

00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:38,529
bank of Tokyo in a same or and the text

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:42,819
domain must be this Bangkok Tokyo and

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:45,819
the stats we have tax that I help to

00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:48,130
filter the team while in the team page

00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:52,209
and these tracks need to be mentioned

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:56,709
and we have other normal tax and subject

00:11:52,209 --> 00:12:01,600
X subject tracks need to be put at least

00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:04,750
one but not more than three so you need

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,490
to check the track page how many tax our

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,930
region here how many subject acts are

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,360
written here you need to take the

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,670
subject tax as well and license you are

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,230
right and license you need to mention

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,660
these who is license you are using we

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,630
are using GPL Watson to or decal Watson

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,339
to or later or GPL version 3 you need to

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,589
mention who is license you are using

00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,779
because if you don't mention the license

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:29,769
we will not agree with him because it

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:33,339
must be GPL so generally lots of teams

00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:36,160
are using GPL Watson tour later so here

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:38,680
is license gnu general public license

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,280
and license you are right the the

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,680
license URI of this

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,720
GPL license and you need to write the

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,340
parson over here and each time you

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,160
object at him you need to operate this

00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,470
version for example this wasn't in 1.4

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,180
and if you want to operate the theme you

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,810
need to put something like one-way tribe

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,550
our one point four point one one point

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,070
four point two or something like that so

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:06,350
just bomb the version end or get the

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:08,750
thing and there here is altar in also

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,250
your what place total username like that

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,680
and here is author you are right and

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,610
here is Tim you are right this ought Tim

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,560
you are a an author URI are optional you

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,110
either whether you put it or not it is

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,250
optional but if you put it it must be

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:27,770
valid for example if you are altar for

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,810
example you can write the theme you are

00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,940
right here what you are a must have the

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,620
information about the team for example

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:38,510
if you if you write the team URI here

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,670
www.ketv.com and if there is nothing

00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:45,080
mentioned that is not allowed so that

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:46,940
this must be valid length and author URI

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,570
unite you know you can write your own

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:56,300
blog or your home's both side you are

00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:58,790
right over here and here is Tim you are

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,740
an author URI you need to mention that

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,900
these are optional takes domain I

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,960
already discussed about and tax in solve

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,260
the tasks you need to check here subject

00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,089
tax these subject acts are not allowed

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,460
more than three but at least one for

00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,830
example subject acts are like blog food

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,720
and rings photography like that you can

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:21,830
you need to take those subject acts in a

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,080
team handbook if I you can just Google

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,120
what is team handbook and you will get

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,750
the result or you can I'll show you the

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,490
steps in the next slide as well and

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,370
functional peers will help you need to

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:37,339
Inc you just for example hard-coded 0

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,730
s-- is not allowed for example while

00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:43,220
developing HTML template used GS and CS

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,920
is hard-coded likewise you are not

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,170
allowed to use in what miss team for

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,080
example if you include double P into

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,889
jQuery that is not allowed because most

00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,350
popular JavaScript are

00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:57,299
what with itself so you don't need to

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,249
include jQuery you don't need to include

00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:01,679
you don't need to put messenger

00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:03,569
messenger eggs or just file in the tip

00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,049
because they are already loaded in what

00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,600
place

00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:08,160
so most popular Java scripts are a

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,480
little arranged so you don't need to

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:17,489
load the JavaScript and something

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,049
popular JavaScript and do not load

00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:21,989
popularity either dimension here and

00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:27,619
prefixing prefix width in lock for

00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:30,569
example for example in in this case what

00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:33,809
2017 is a takes domain we call it's log

00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:36,119
as well and you need to prefix all the

00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:39,600
functions name class names global

00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:42,480
variable in this size handle name filter

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,879
name need to be prefix with this Kim's

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,169
log for example if you are going to

00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:51,449
create a function for function function

00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:54,569
name that function name must be prefix

00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:57,480
for example function Bangkok that length

00:15:54,569 --> 00:16:03,829
of need to be prefix with the timid so

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:09,360
that if your team name is what ABCD your

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:11,339
your this slog is what ABCD so those are

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,549
usually need to be put in everywhere

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,470
like this PHP class name global

00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:24,919
variables extra loop Twitter's skip

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:28,019
handles image resize names now yeah

00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,669
validation sanitization in escaping this

00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,819
is the security proposed of what this

00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:35,369
thing and you need to know how we can

00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:39,419
escape how we can validate how we can

00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:41,279
make the team sanitize you need to check

00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,619
while developing themes are while

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,720
reading team sanitation validation and

00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:48,379
escaping is the most important factor

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,389
for make your team secure

00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,699
validate in or sanitize untrusted data

00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,519
before entering into database for

00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:58,499
example if you make all filled in your

00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,619
theme for example in customizer or

00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:04,500
something like that you need to validate

00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:07,860
those data before internal interval

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,800
for example here is the sanitized email

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,140
we can use this function to senator is

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,390
sender's email sent eyes takes Twitter

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,179
for the text field data and escape ul

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:21,120
Allah Epson it exit alpha this is KP

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,040
Elroy's for the URL and obscenities for

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,189
the absolute integers so that you need

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:30,540
to put these validates validation

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:32,429
functions while correct after that all

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,510
under status should be escaped before

00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:41,490
output for example if you make a field

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:44,550
for a URL and while give the output you

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,910
need to put escape URL and then the fill

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:50,910
name so that your URL will escape in

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,760
that will be secured for example here is

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:58,790
sanitized email escape attribute escape

00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:01,650
URL escape s TM l I've seen it it's a de

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,020
this is kept function we can use in

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,970
theme but you need to use the proper

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,100
state function for the proper use for

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,220
example if you are going to escape the

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,809
email you don't need to you are not

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,640
allowed to use escape attribute escape

00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:17,490
activities for escaping the HTML

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,610
attributes and this escape HTML is

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,309
generally for the removing HTML tags in

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,900
your field so you need to use the proper

00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,850
escape functions you need to use the

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,670
proper standardization and validation

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,410
function while coding customizer data

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,240
must be sanitized before saving in

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,000
escape it before I would for example

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,890
what place one leaves support the

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,080
customizer API is not setting a theme

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,640
options like that is not allowed so

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,750
customizer if you while developing

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,630
settings in customizer you need to use

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,160
these same types callback and sanitize

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,890
Sanjay is called that function for

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,179
example Sen his type stage 3 for example

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,460
if you are going to make a field for

00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,260
petrol we need to use cent I scroll back

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,740
sandesh text field for example if you

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:04,470
are going to make the feel for URLs cent

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,330
I scroll drag escaped URL rock for

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,760
example if you are going to make the

00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,760
field for integer you need to same type

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,800
call that you need to make the function

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,930
for the integer for example if you are

00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,090
going to make the sigmax you need to

00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,740
mental functions were sick but there are

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,270
lots of st. Isis on escaping and

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,750
validation from some available in

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:27,550
WordPress but if that is not available

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,930
you need to make your own function and

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,730
you need to put it there

00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:35,370
otherwise your data will not save and

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,370
your team will sue the euro in issues

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,700
now what are not allowed keep it in mind

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,130
the before below listed things what are

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,430
the things that are totally not allowed

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,900
while developing themes or while so many

00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,000
hints in the WordPress doctor if you are

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,650
planning to make things right now are

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,740
from if you have funding to start

00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:58,330
developing themes from today and if you

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,700
are planning to so many things in your

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,630
dress that or something like that or if

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,710
you are planning to make your own

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,390
marketplace ourselves for WordPress

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,440
themes you need to develop the proper

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:14,620
standard poodle team so that did this

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,210
all these standards are also useful for

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,310
the theme perished in popular or other

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,680
marketplaces it's all because they also

00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,540
have the similar structure similar way

00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,970
of coding and similar requirement like

00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,880
what was taught on

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:30,310
for example custom post type including

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,260
custom post type in themes is not

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,700
allowed in wordpress.org custom post

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,760
type for example if you are going to

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,650
make a custom post type for team for

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,800
testimonial for something like that that

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,780
is not allowed if you are now if you

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,970
need to put the custom post type you

00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,880
need to develop the compatible plugins

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,760
and plugin must be in or this chart was

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:56,350
but I think there there are very there

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:59,500
are various multi phases we allows this

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,210
custom post type text tsunamis but what

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,970
we start not allowed this custom post

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,880
types and taxonomies and map plugins not

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,500
allowed to bundle plugins in themes can

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,270
recommend plugging in those plug-in must

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,920
win what they start out if you are

00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,630
planning to samba theme you've got a

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,090
starter going if you bundle the plug-in

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,490
in the team that is not allowed but you

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,370
can recommend to Hagen you can recommend

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,050
plug-in there are different methods and

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,810
but the recommitted plug-in must be

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:29,280
inside the what is total repository and

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:32,220
that we recomm the

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,080
plug-in must be regularly updated and

00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,580
something like that and start codes

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,200
short codes are not allowed

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,200
you can you are not allowed to make

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,630
shortcuts on Tim for example you can

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,910
make the field to enjoy the short code

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,850
but making short code in theme is not

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,920
allowed

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:53,060
now it's tensor size for example this is

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,580
the stencil size size of my team and

00:21:53,060 --> 00:22:01,380
this screen shirt size is in 4 is to 3

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:05,790
ratio means 880 by 660 or to 100 by 900

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,710
pixel size 4 is to 3 in is disconcert

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,020
need to be recommended

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,200
sorry required and the recommended size

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,310
is to well 100 by 900 you can put 885

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,560
660 as well

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,510
but for the high scheduled screen

00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:23,550
resolution where you come in to a landed

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:25,800
right 900 in the sides now just just a

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,250
few things you need to care about WP n

00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,810
WP n P of what miss always in upper case

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,510
I think you all know about these things

00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,610
WN p of what which is always in upper

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,560
case remove unnecessary commented code

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,540
if you comment while developing themes

00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,220
and before submitting him you need to

00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,230
check all the community codes and you

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,540
need to remove this because those

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,750
garbage things are not allowed in themes

00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,040
no customization no customizing that

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,010
what we said even you haven't allowed to

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,570
customize the WordPress admin panel like

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:58,340
in your own color or something like that

00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:01,670
because they admin must be perfectly

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,690
fine while activating all themes

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,220
redirection is not allowed out of thing

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,850
activated for example while activating

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:12,090
theme while activating theme and lots of

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:14,220
things to do the redirection and send it

00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,170
to the traffic to the other side and

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,250
this is also not allowed it's not

00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,470
allowed to remove the default

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,870
functionality of code default

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,640
functionality is not allowed to remove

00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,850
from the themes don't include

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,710
development files I lots of time I'll

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,870
recommend to don't include development

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,460
files because you can put development

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,040
tiles in github or something like that

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,290
so what we start off repository is not

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,840
for the development purpose there are

00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,330
lots of simple users they don't know how

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,869
to use that those double

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:47,210
I like self something like that so you

00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:49,820
can put those development hiring video

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,470
or something places but I don't

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,590
recommend to put in the team holder

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,570
premium team soft should be GPL for

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,580
example if you host team in what best

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,919
product and if you steal the premium

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,940
themes from your website those premium

00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:06,409
things also be GPL if you are your free

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,440
themes if you have three teams in what

00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:12,019
way starbug and if you send that traffic

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,899
with Tim you are at your roadside that

00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:16,639
website thins premium things also must

00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:18,830
be GPL and you need to mention the

00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:20,269
license in your team something in places

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,710
all the things all the premium themes

00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:26,749
are GPL compatible don't include back of

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,070
hats on theme folder for example to

00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:31,309
communicate code or something like that

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:33,289
oh I got so far authors say that I will

00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:35,059
use this theme later I will use this

00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:38,239
functionality later so that I just

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:40,190
commented I will use these later so this

00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:41,359
is another also don't include backup

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,789
files or something like that in your

00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,980
theme folder no analytics are tracking

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:49,009
for example tracking cool or analytics

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,100
code or something that is not allowed in

00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:54,559
themes no sharing a PI API is allowed

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,960
Facebook Twitter sharing API is not

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,409
allowed but just you can just put some

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,489
simple Facebook link you can put that

00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:07,159
but this API is not about save of

00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:09,799
Sanjana single a array means you are not

00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,139
allowed to make the new table or a new

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:15,889
row in a database you are not allowed

00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:18,440
after activating the theme no were

00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:21,649
adding added mass this is all discussed

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:25,580
no URL shortened used in that him for

00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:27,859
example G o.co like that those sort and

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:31,759
URL is not allowed on coding design

00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:34,749
should be your own legal yours even what

00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:37,460
YC GPL but what must be legally yours

00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:39,350
you are not allowed to copy other things

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,450
you know if this is dependent let me

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:45,559
change the name and submit in again you

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:47,989
what will start off because this GPL but

00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,029
you can rewrite this code you can reuse

00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:52,700
that code but totally you are not

00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:54,680
allowed to put in what we start off by

00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,680
copying other things you

00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,210
what responsibilities and freezers first

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,370
available there are lots of features

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,500
available in WordPress school we

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,740
recommended you to use those features

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,500
first and then only if for example

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,150
background image header text color

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,130
something like that is already already

00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:18,350
available in WordPress course so don't

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:21,380
do that cuz you are not allowed to

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,660
duplicate existing features and then

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,520
custom favicon a favicon is not allowed

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,910
it's for functionality you need to know

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,470
this tiny things check name collision

00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,600
before submitting the team in what way

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,030
starter for example if you are planning

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,560
to submit a theme name ocean dog living

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,650
for example ocean doubt will be theme is

00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,150
already in place that are those theme

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,850
will not upload in WordPress or for

00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:45,860
example if the thing is not in what way

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,780
starter but if the thing is another

00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,090
place is like popular themes something

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,310
like that those names are also not

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,680
allowed to of your in WordPress total so

00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,650
that ship name collision you can just

00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,750
google it and you can easily find the

00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,780
results those thing is available or not

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,910
so instead of normal lane you can just

00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,660
check the random name and you can put

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,810
the nickname

00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,970
so meet one theme at a time just one

00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:12,500
thing in WordPress travel at a time you

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,440
are not allowed to submit multiple

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,020
things at a time if the theme grows

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,610
clothes are like after then you can

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,770
submit another thing again if you are

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,500
going to review or if you are going to

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,950
develop the themes you can do these

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,830
things

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,810
this is very useful tips check existing

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,790
life tickets so that you can know what

00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,070
are the cuttings how review process

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,860
walks and you can follow the theme

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,480
guidelines handbook and start leaving

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,940
other themes this is also the best

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,590
method to learn how we can develop

00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,780
things if you review other things you

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,660
can know how could walk what are the

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:53,600
basic things or that we need to worry

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:56,350
about while developing themes and you

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,150
can join theory which analog slack

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,520
attend meeting regularly and contact

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,080
with more standard means you can join

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,680
the team leave a channel and you can ask

00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,879
a I'm gonna review a team how I can

00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,799
proceed or

00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:11,479
I'm living team and I got this problem

00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,669
and also they saying that this is

00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:16,789
allowed but I don't think so you can ask

00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:20,479
any random person related to team review

00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:23,629
our team still so this is the best way

00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:26,809
to launder team developing in team

00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:28,669
review now how team review process works

00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:31,429
you can you need to submit your team

00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:35,479
first it will go in our wet queue and

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:38,419
then reboot and solve issues or your

00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:40,279
team will close means you need you will

00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:42,949
communicate with the river in this step

00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,440
and then you need to wear the admin

00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:47,779
review and admin like me and there are a

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,459
few other elements we'll check the final
