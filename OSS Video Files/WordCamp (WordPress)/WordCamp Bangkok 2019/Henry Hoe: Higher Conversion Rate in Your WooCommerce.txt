00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:06,330
so remember in the session will be on

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:15,259
the five e-commerce metrics right to

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:20,909
help you use Javanese so how many of you

00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:24,590
rather you come for me okay and how many

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:31,799
of you run an agency that manages people

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:34,970
constantly so today under sharing these

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,970
key metrics

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,290
[Music]

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,660
[Music]

00:02:45,200 --> 00:03:03,230
these are some of the keeps - OH

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,410
we write these be an open source

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:39,590
you know everybody contributes to this

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:44,370
community that's why I love it you start

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:48,010
writing this test only you know

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:59,610
if you want some feature on your website

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:59,610
already constant function right so using

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:13,660
comes to your website actually checks

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:19,680
out mp4 item so let's say you hundred

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,680
people coming to your website you have a

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:43,690
experience you're sending them to your

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,570
product pages and you selling them to

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,440
the checkout page sorry the Caucasian in

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,870
the checkout page

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,870
so that's indicative of high conversion

00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:02,650
commercially obviously that is piece of

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,690
X which is roughly about two percent say

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:10,390
relative 50 people coming into your

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:16,710
website just expect one right so that I

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:20,310
will see that is commercially depends on

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:27,240
what the savagery person

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:31,500
expensive website that commercially so

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,230
it depends of course on the source of

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:40,220
the traffic that you can't even kiss you

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:44,340
have to conversion reason that's a stop

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,890
in to them individually later on some of

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,270
the ones you saw live training how many

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,350
have you have might check out the

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:55,370
website okay so my Chinese is basically

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:59,600
a spelling bee on your website and

00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,600
customers can ask you questions right

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:08,070
listen they're talking to your customers

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,290
daily routine then three more trust me

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,090
and the second one is what I call me

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,850
exceed in ten papa

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,980
which I believe alone you might come

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,830
across this when you try to exceed on

00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:23,250
website something pops up okay the tree

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:27,600
is the urgency and scarcity so I

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,120
realized this of your website okay I'll

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,120
just yes

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:42,810
you have a pistol about here for let's

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:45,820
see three of us or let's say like okay

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:48,850
if the customer views that they can come

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,260
back three days later and indexing price

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,620
there's no urgency

00:07:50,260 --> 00:08:02,310
there's no scan speed they know they are

00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:20,410
not obliged to you know check out okay

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:26,310
number five is you actually so you sell

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:29,350
everything but these if you just sound

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:33,520
so let's see I just said Felicia on my

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:36,070
website or I sell like that on my

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,950
website I sell them assess reason my

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,380
website so we Qingdao would read much

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:51,340
just ignores what and then actually help

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:57,250
you to the conversion having fish agree

00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:59,860
having competitive pricing so in 2010 we

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:03,610
sell the same product a thousand nine

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:09,990
that people would normally choose you

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,990
then by Fox audience having congruent

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,330
five thousand-pound get free shipping

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,050
something like that sometimes customers

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:09,000
do not want talking like to a live chat

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:12,570
or maybe a phone call the right and

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,110
these evidences should we serve more

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,110
customers

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,790
this visit is on website the wagon is

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,980
having you're having a business address

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,610
having some contact information you

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:32,279
should then our little business thing is

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:34,230
having that means because too much

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,600
people commerce right step you can

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,560
customize the emails there we got

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,930
customers like the confirmation email

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,550
things like that so you can use the

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,910
little one we can put your brand a

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:52,900
little bit right this would prove the

00:10:48,910 --> 00:11:04,870
trust that you have with the customer 14

00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:07,720
is having it takes like it's against it

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:15,910
wouldn't want each okay let's see that's

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:18,310
really story since I go to the beach I

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,440
pull to the category page

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:24,040
I wouldn't product leach a little

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,130
cottage a google checkout page telling

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,270
me my forty seven forty seconds right

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:35,680
assuming that when everything will be

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:41,800
the product commission down to like two

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:45,510
seconds that will be ten seconds in your

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:50,340
psyche speed increases the public on is

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:54,820
increasing speed of the channel is

00:11:50,340 --> 00:12:02,010
exponentially and our fifteen is as you

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:02,010
so enable search for my head like happen

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:08,970
one ranked number one in pattern get

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:11,860
back home so people choose you because

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,939
people have this idea then the local

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:18,819
code is they are yes all we're showing

00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:21,970
you that you're the best design okay so

00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:26,049
having parents who will help you to rank

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:28,540
to convert better 16 is piloting friends

00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:34,749
so something like McDonald's ready

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:40,959
people but this because the beverage

00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:46,439
with the other brands of 70 is having a

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:48,910
credible keep winning like you know

00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:54,100
Australian is having some such images

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:59,230
like Facebook share noggin like this

00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:03,579

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,549
shown convey this message to the

00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:15,629
customer and number 19 is having some

00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:43,079
sale so let's type D Sub Inspectors okay

00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:43,079
because as I mentioned website security

00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:53,919
solution benefit so let me explain about

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:56,619
this ownership and it means that what is

00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,810
the benefit of the oldest Puna

00:13:56,619 --> 00:14:03,389
from the top

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:08,550
I want to excel nobody's that experience

00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:11,310
of buying Espada okay and how do that is

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:15,990
to using my reviews and things like that

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:20,279
- she has the morning studies show the

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:24,600
benefit of mine and said it has no

00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:31,100
treatment age as well as possible so

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:40,819
that is focused on TV you can use

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:44,639
Facebook message the transition from

00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:51,329
Facebook messaging because with Facebook

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:54,779
messaging you could use changes baby

00:14:51,329 --> 00:15:00,920
check so in fact this book Champa only

00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:04,829
needs to switch at home yes you could

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:08,189
use my facebook chat Bob he customers

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:11,550
ask you some questions you could direct

00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:14,850
them to a mountain chain through to

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:18,269
answer their questions at the system to

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,070
buy something again see that we do not

00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,710
actually

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,290
to do that right

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,570
cotton is actually what I'm using right

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:31,410
now which I'm actually very happy with

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:33,590
it you could do a lot of JSON in it also

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,990
allows you to capture certain key words

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:41,040
that trigger certain messages within us

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:43,560
like what is the shipping fee then use

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,670
shipping fee as the keyword and what

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,770
that last is that when boo well then

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,290
shipping fee even appears above the

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:56,240
messages actually goes on to them and

00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:59,580
answer them right but it's not as

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,790
engaging as using like a chapel so which

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:07,860
is why I imagine you think platform like

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:12,330
Facebook message instead - Azurill - my

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:15,780
life engine so this is the bounce

00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:20,870
activity my pigeons answering the

00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:27,680
questions and I want with the exit and

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:27,680
so let me move back

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:42,660
so let's see Integra par excellence on

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:46,590
the pom-pom comes up right anything is

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:50,160
actually more powerful right and to

00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:53,430
master this new disease there is in a

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:59,660
website called storm there will be home

00:16:53,430 --> 00:17:03,150
pages content on the backside on storm

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:08,280
let me write some articles on clocks and

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:12,780
website okay so you so you would have no

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:19,079
clues as well we are some pages yeah

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:23,120
yeah so is that I will say it is

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:27,750
customers that come to our website w-

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:32,490
religious what are we looking for anyone

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:38,670
is exactly when they land on your blog

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:41,420
page don't blog posts and one has HIV so

00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,420
multi the track

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,340
of the breweries the answer is they're

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,280
looking for information

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,200
all right they're looking for

00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,809
information so what do you want to get

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:03,870
them information right if you move on to

00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:08,240
your product pages of your cupcakes on a

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:11,910
checkout page what are they looking for

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,420
they are looking to buy or they have the

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:19,050
intention to buy right so if you try to

00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:21,260
deceive the website to the page you want

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:37,320
to have a problem then offer them

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:41,100
permission to reach these copies check

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:45,630
out these this is when you do that often

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:49,710
dance industry so this is the best

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:52,920
practice okay and it helps the customer

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:56,670
we think it puts purchasing from your

00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:06,110
website back facility using this kind of

00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:24,150
Ibiza any more urgency is the time limit

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:28,950
is up to me is because early with B

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:35,809
units and what's wrong it's wrong right

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:35,809
I do some of it is our stop what I do

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,899

thousands you will have several

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,280
responses very obvious

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:51,430
okay the reason why one is two things

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:54,589
one is because when people stop okay

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,589

00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,630
[Music]

00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:22,120
so then the and the last one is the most

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:24,940
an adjustable settings or yeah this is

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,190
the only digital three tablets that you

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,159
can get somebody to do it for you

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:33,190
so this is something like the

00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:40,350
destruction feature compass there's not

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:40,350
much of a okay signal isolation is

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,709
[Music]

00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:26,370
the website with SEO services because

00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:30,880
when you say you social content

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:34,419
what this does is that price most

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,539
assuredly the moonship entity so what

00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:40,840
this this is customer testimonials is

00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:43,390
like reviews on website okay and a very

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,789
good that this is called customer

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:50,590
reviews for Buchanan's and is completely

00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:53,890
free as well are you happy version it

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:59,529
does no such as sending up when you

00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:02,559
review requests in a Senate passes well

00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:06,760
you can offer like some coupon discount

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:10,000
to the customers that before you write

00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:13,659
so has more features is probably more

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,870
the best what they have tried so this is

00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:15,870
how you

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,250
[Music]

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,110
that really parity to your website so if

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:31,930
they want to look at previous customers

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,930
when both of you do this you can do this

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:43,070
the second is the personal contact

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,960
number so if you have a line on building

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:50,570
a cordon that would increase your

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:54,910
conversion rate by 11 the same this

00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:58,760
conversion rate by 11 percent it is the

00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:03,050
conversion of actually I think is people

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,730
who actually advocate but this is not

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:10,760
like the money will come into your

00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:19,010
website check out yeah increases by 10

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:22,099
times as how live chat so this helps so

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:26,669
some people left

00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:33,019

00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:46,139
them about they operated with live chat

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:49,710
and things like that so the long hand

00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:54,570

channel and having practice of that

00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:06,210
which is planning and even so you design

00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:08,879
you may lose having pregnant a teacher

say you don't have the iPhone case the

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:38,839
you also have to be the branding as well

00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:48,530
so you can the comic industry

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:54,169
that is one for me number nine speed

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:59,740
viscosity so some of them that abuses of

00:27:54,169 --> 00:28:06,789
optimize of you three - and energy so

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:06,789
this doesn't seem to wait for them its

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:21,169
treatment has to catch something on the

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:26,390
website so they would master television

use GT metrics as well as a new HB

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:45,890
insights okay excuse this big banking is

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:54,289

website is credible some of the uses use

00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:07,659
redirection so we use

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:21,360
ESS trees or belongs a sweet something

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:26,220
again so happens to be small nuts -

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:40,770
seven and then he comes out X comes up X

00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:52,710

00:29:40,770 --> 00:30:09,390
choose so you do which is the new which

00:29:52,710 --> 00:30:15,390
is any tie up so I picked all my

00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:21,900
bathroom is this bubble yeah so this

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:22,880
piece so you actually form a stronger

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:37,440
brand

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:43,710
so you see but it is like healthy or

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:48,360
something like that right entire you are

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:51,230
doing the credibly emo on Kiki so it

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,230
sorta

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,519
[Music]

00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:37,990
[Music]

00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:40,510
you are top-three

00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,110
because it differs with every different

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,130
country

00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:50,020

00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,820
beaches

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:29,429
is the proof of share buttons as well so

00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:35,010
if you have a lot of people on the

00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:43,970
website so you have a lot of problems

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:46,230

this is having some pictures per second

00:32:49,590 --> 00:33:00,270
is that recommendation when you want to

00:32:52,710 --> 00:33:13,160
amend and then having an FAQ section as

00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:20,610

00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,239
[Music]

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,659
[Music]

00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:52,440
the children down because there is only

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,440
some accessories

00:34:53,330 --> 00:35:01,130
by my iPhone where's eco I didn't focus

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,800

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:08,650
cable charging cable something like that

00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,650
I mean y-you mean really don't relax

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,790
what's the chatter you know you keep

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,560
everything and you have they will charge

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,650
them directly

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,390
ok so if you about straighten the car

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,700
this is still on us

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:32,510
[Music]

00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:36,440
57 so that's the you some issues or

00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:43,250
let's say three dogs and the free

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:45,380
shipping as $35 so and check out and

00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,780
having checker options so check option

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:56,780
is going to have a community one some

00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:59,240
kind of keep wrapping okay so an example

00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,310
is this when this is for cross-selling

00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,290
and upselling so you sound really

00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:08,750
loosening some hands together

00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:11,560
you sound refugee agency celebratin okay

00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,050
and this is another one so you sell

00:36:11,560 --> 00:37:25,320
yourself a bonus

00:36:14,050 --> 00:37:30,580
I just need to make sure that my

00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:33,340
position is more than the 15 died again

00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:38,650
right and when you reduce the shipping

00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:41,680
class from supplier to you from shipping

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:44,110
the customer it is a positive entry you

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,650
use even communities with this agonizing

00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:51,720
cost optimization at home team we use

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,720
all things and run across

00:37:53,209 --> 00:38:07,950
is it budget so this is this country

00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:09,869
which is the value this is pretty in the

00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,940
homework is discussing about stereotypes

00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:14,789
so if the u.s. take us for two years and

00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,069
in place for the four others over the

00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:20,940
twist pivot cost money hiding from each

00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:23,459
of them okay so that is completed

00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,259
through using e let's say you can use a

00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:34,079
trough thank you and then divide by

00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:44,160
customers at one time and you can use

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:45,589
this we have this we call it I'm not

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:54,739
really used this one before

00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:58,019
okay this everything to increase this

00:38:54,739 --> 00:39:01,499
you want to keep the customer as long as

00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:04,519
possible with you and homeland beginning

00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:10,529
marketing to running as with them up in

00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:13,619
increasing led and the last and this is

00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:16,619
the most importantly whatever that you

00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:19,049
have about this five metrics right

00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:22,799
the most important one is your net

00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:25,049
profit how much can you really eating to

00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:26,579
be at all these metrics back a little

00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:37,469
bit how much money are you putting into

00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:40,640
your candy right so is the email

00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:44,390
modeling so even what we can have

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,670
she and increasing all these different

00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:49,099
metrics right using your conversion rate

00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,500
increasing increasing your customer

00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:57,049
lifetime value right and how you do that

00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:59,660
is to be dimensionally plan you so these

00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:03,170
are some of the emails the one which is

00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:05,180
the Welcome series right so how do you

00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:10,640
welcome customers must agreed on a

00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:12,940
common website hope you will contact or

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:18,440
come if initiative on send to them and

00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:21,490
abandon happiness so my best practice is

00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:26,299
our self the first we lose on the first

00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:29,900
ask in 10 degrees and we pursue this our

00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:32,660
customers who have both of you but they

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:37,450
disappear for sometimes one sense of

00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:39,109
distance of them so this is how we will

00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,869
miss you

00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:44,390
compared to giving you this come and

00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:46,460
some tips is having the two Center forms

00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,920
as I mentioned right what is the content

00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:53,809
oneness leave the stock first purchase

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:57,049
this compass you can subscribe to your

00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:59,690
social media pages right then

00:40:57,049 --> 00:41:03,740
fiction and images you see your

00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:09,200
company's branding so this is one of the

00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:14,720
advantages so the last one is the CDC's

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:21,230
my visitation sorry I was absolutely

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:25,930
practically download this last year so

00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:25,930
you guys can discuss academic job

00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,739
[Music]

00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:21,020
