Description: 
	Good software engineers can be found anywhere, and embracing remote working enables you to tap into that global pool. But just because you can… does that mean you should? In this talk I’ll go through some dos and don’ts, talk about some pitfalls, and hopefully guide you towards doing remote the right way. I’ll include some stories that draw on my experience working in technical recruitment for clients who have been on both sides of the do/don’t scale, as well as Automattic’s decade-plus experience as a fully-distributed company.
