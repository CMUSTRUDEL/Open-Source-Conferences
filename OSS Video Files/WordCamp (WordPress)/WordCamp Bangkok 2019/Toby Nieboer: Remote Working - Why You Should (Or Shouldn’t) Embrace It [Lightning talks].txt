Title: Toby Nieboer: Remote Working - Why You Should (Or Shouldn’t) Embrace It [Lightning talks]
Publication date: 2019-09-05
Playlist: WordCamp Bangkok 2019
Description: 
	Good software engineers can be found anywhere, and embracing remote working enables you to tap into that global pool. But just because you can… does that mean you should? In this talk I’ll go through some dos and don’ts, talk about some pitfalls, and hopefully guide you towards doing remote the right way. I’ll include some stories that draw on my experience working in technical recruitment for clients who have been on both sides of the do/don’t scale, as well as Automattic’s decade-plus experience as a fully-distributed company.

00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:37,739
thank you all right no race each

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,610
other because it's awesome alright

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:44,250
thanks Amy

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:46,559
that's alright let's rally this talk

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,110
might be better entitled having no

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,630
problem

00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:53,100
[Music]

00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:56,490
so a little bit about the first token

00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,780
higher sovereign engineers for automatic

00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:03,700
you may know is accompanied by jetpack

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,790
Gravatar we complex bunch of other

00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,770
things right now there are eight hundred

00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,360
and fifty four of us in 69 countries

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,430
speaking eighty four languages

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,280
we've been distributed since day one

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,600
that's nearly fourteen years ago so

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,070
what's the difference between our button

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:25,900
industry in a remote setup there's hot

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:27,790
summer and one of our people work in a

00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,130
distributed company - no office of

00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,240
everybody no salesmen the first set of

00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,189
small conference on been refreshed

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,909
today and everything we're talking about

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:39,439
- you're getting some bass as well some

00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,640
would say great about working remotely

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,799
or employing people who are mode both

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,170
cases the major benefit of prostate

00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,390
expanded opportunity let's say you're a

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,860
typical Silicon Valley company and the

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,020
only looking to hire developers from

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,429
inside anyways

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,520
according to stack overflows most recent

00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:00,890
relative 718 you're excluding 77% under

00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,909
20 million developers visitor of

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,619
enclosure talent is equally distributed

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,660
around the world but opportunities at

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,360
home remote distributed companies

00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:14,410
changes and provide opportunities on

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,410
both sides otherwise

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,860
holy get to mr. let's define what we're

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,870
talking about

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,460
remote is not just about being able

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,880
whatever no pajamas

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,350
although that is infringement what

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,020
remote working is really about is

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,090
flexibility flexibility family

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,430
commitments with educational commitments

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,550
with disabilities amount of time

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,590
sentence joy on that to contribute

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,590
meaning without being physically present

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,620
[Music]

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,800
promoting is nothing better opening that

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,410
rather than be incredibly damaging

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,060
it's all too easy to develop habits the

00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,390
breed inefficiency exclusion it takes

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,890
the tongue of commitment

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,420
to pull off

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:09,370
but it's absolutely worth it protects

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,370
the access to talent opportunity

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,550
so the bag has been doing this for a

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,050
little while so we have a few tips for

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,030
the first act is though everyone

00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,400
remember the second you have a meeting

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,880
and find people in the room that one one

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,030
sir

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,830
you created two years its follower

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,830
inclusive that means ten

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,129
the second is to default of asynchronous

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,349
communication when we let go of the idea

00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:40,720
that everyone hasn't be bounded by this

00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:43,620
second you give people permission to use

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,620
the flexibility

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,319
one thing that makes a scene is to

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,780
working work is to document absolutely

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,520
with an automatic open sources our

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,700
culture that's a foundational principle

00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,400
and documentation is confident the too

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,100
often documentation after the fact and

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,630
only about the in state we document

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,000
everything's we don't want from the

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,720
original idea to all the discussions of

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,580
the decisions and the final product that

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,580
way attention with context

00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:21,530
you also need to be quite intentional

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:23,240
about building the culture when your

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,970
remote with no such thing as coming in

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,669
and see Great Britain or heading out the

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,860
spontaneous

00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,020
providing them the opportunity and

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,900
crucially the commission for socializing

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:40,090
the pump it's these other cops created

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:42,939
 it is important to get together in

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,590
person and what Matic we do see much

00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:46,889
less bless you

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,229
[Music]

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,610
they throw up to these to not only get a

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,370
bunch of work that in a really

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,669
accelerated way but they created cement

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,590
bonds the carrier's Felicity the team

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,360
has made Isis to make the best use by

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,729
being fairly ambitious about what you

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,759
want to accomplish but not to rely too

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:04,759
much

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:12,390
so conversing there are peanuts the

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:16,120
verses the conversations about work that

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,860
exclude your colleagues don't talk about

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,870
work issues on the phone be the person

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,780
or entity here do it in the public

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,000
psyche check if you can't do make sure

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,970
you recap the conversation another one

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,260
I'm in a situation of previous job where

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,150
I had described a week's worth of work

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,430
and start over because I missed out on

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,270
one conversation there's nothing that

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,270
could kill turn around

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:47,650
as with most workplaces communities I

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:53,050
won't say communication oxygen with a

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:55,810
spirited company and that is if you

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,490
don't see that negate the benefits by

00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,440
the existing the people stick to a

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,330
particular schedule this just tells you

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,760
people who don't trust and people don't

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,440
respond well to that embracing her above

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:10,930
all means embracing certain loss of

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,400
control and finally don't pull an

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,740
experiment will leave yourself in the

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,220
state that you have to commute Trust

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,220
goes both ways

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,650
also Lila promote isn't critical when

00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,749
shooting the body from the perspective

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,430
of the business in implementing the

00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:34,849
motivated existing economy takes

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,849
resources it's not

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,970
for an individual respect they ask

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,889
yourself if Lisa determine whether what

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:46,139
he plans needs structure that office

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:46,139
community do you need to near happy

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,750
another thing to consider with some of

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,160
the onboard people whatever my company a

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,500
lot of the time they're on board with

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,840
each other but at the same time getting

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,160
it right for that's even more free so if

00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,810
your tender in the first year is

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,700
relatively high ending the fixed

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,700
onboarding process before introducing

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:11,270
junior developers ramp up the complexity

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:15,370
of your onboarding to develop as a new

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:23,270
company it's a super advancement

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:27,980
it's something that we see going back to

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:30,800
my original time remote working why you

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,810
should push it in aggressive you should

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,450
embrace your mobility if you're looking

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,390
to expand your options in your opinion

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:42,980
you shouldn't raise your motive here

00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:44,630
aware what it takes to succeed and you

00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:59,630
should embrace promote its opinion

00:07:44,630 --> 00:08:02,890
values and again I think we've got a

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,890
little bit of time for questions

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,029
[Music]

00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,710
so the question was what's the best

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,810
practices for selecting team members for

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:22,640
our hiring process is fairly intensive

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:26,750
and simulates means of all working

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:30,710
environment as best we can so we have a

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:35,030
page file that is entirely remotely an

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:41,780
entire process it's done remotely so

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:46,220
it's very very similar to so that works

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:48,650
really well for us it exposes inability

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,690
to board people who are not see the

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,830
third thereabout environment it exposes

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:57,140
that generally speaking when we look

00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,160
forward they will are just communication

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,160
first and foremost

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,340
[Music]

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,960
[Music]

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:32,060
so the question is whether there's any

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:38,540
online resources something that we would

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:38,540
yeah it's it's in problems so not yet

00:09:52,410 --> 00:10:01,480
[Music]

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:06,089
that's not for one moment we wanted to

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,089
do that secret treat in person retreat

00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:13,259
these are the locations of work both you

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,740
guys are like possum

00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,740
launching

00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:25,169
so the question is whether we have the

00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:26,359
weather have any tips about organizing

00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:28,350
report rates

00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:31,470
it's a little bit different for us

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:34,410
because we have to whip up to the point

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,910
now where we have to be able to bid 850

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:43,800
people so at the moment we're so

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:48,699
constricted to results logic convention

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:51,309
destinations but internally because we

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:55,149
do meet ups twice a year a team of the

00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:58,290
survey teams we sort of maintain at the

00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,670
terminal block that just compares

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,769
destinations where we stay what the

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,490
internet was like what the cost was

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:10,869
focus how much travel time there was

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:18,060
involved in getting there yeah so

00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:21,210
basically just given everything to us

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,210
[Music]

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,210
yeah never say never I don't think it's

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,970
I'm not sure if it's a list of things to

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:37,620
do at the moment but it's definitely a

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,620
very useful resource

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,110
