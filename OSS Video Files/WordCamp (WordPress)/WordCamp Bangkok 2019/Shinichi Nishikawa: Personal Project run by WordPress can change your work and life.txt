in front

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:51,280
thank you yeah so my kids these are like

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:54,650
fish I got from my fisherman friends so

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,070
like they you need fish but like they

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,950
give me fish like this so I need to stop

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:09,200
working and cut them before eating them

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:14,530
yeah also this is a building done is in

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,530
front of my house it's a Rossum building

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:43,580
project it's a wordpress community news

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:46,850
video to friends events so if you need

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,090
languages in english and again you can

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,790
see they talk one person authority over

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,480
a lot of news or not but if you don't

00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,970
speak English

00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:00,230
you can't be do you want to avoid that

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,870
and you're left out from what's going on

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:06,260
really so you you suddenly see features

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:11,180
in your and in WordPress and such so we

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:18,350
we are able to provide more news what's

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:19,719
going on pretty so this is one and we

00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:25,360
have

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:25,989
podcast as well and we have something

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,559
too

00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:30,339
so this is a basically copy of double

00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:35,919
katana

00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:39,959
or both data's projects if you know them

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:45,509
I think something to do the same in

00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:48,159
language or your local languages yeah so

00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,579
the benefit of doing this is like you

00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:54,489
really catch up on news like unit create

00:06:51,579 --> 00:07:02,110
the news then we need to read many

00:06:54,489 --> 00:07:04,269
things and through the unit anyone

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:15,909
interested in like doing this in your

00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:20,589
language time cousin yeah next one is is

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:25,499
China and blog is body this is my first

00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:25,499
project this is my first restaurant site

00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:35,599
so what that is this is a multi-site

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,599
website predicted by

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:45,060
so parents come to this website great

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:51,060
books and they upload kids pictures and

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:55,110
share the page to close friends so that

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:59,069
it can be more secure and protected

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:09,810
rather than posting them on Facebook or

00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:13,580
something else so I studied this so it's

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,580
a cute baby

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,860
right I was losing my daughter like

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:23,340
every day because she changes a lot

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:27,330
so next time is a bit different when I

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:31,259
look at one week old tiger I kissed her

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,750
I tick tick one week ago I feel like I'm

00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:37,140
losing her

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:41,490
and that feeling I like hold her be

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:46,950
changed every day so I needed to go get

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:52,570
some and I was picked up on public road

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:56,080
service Japan and someone found it and

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:59,050
determine which is yeah like out of

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,820
nowhere and my wife didn't like that so

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:04,380
I created one for myself

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:10,180
private pokéblock prevent i presently

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:13,690
like for a friend who had new babies and

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:16,180
I hope I can make it into a sauce model

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:21,310
like they just want they trade their box

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:23,680
they do the same thing yeah I still may

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,850
think that oh my god keep clicking

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,850
update what was cotton

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:38,080
Sammy people's focus in secret places

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:40,870
yeah so since this was my project took

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,340
more than one year from when I started

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:49,030
to really release it and through the

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,400
process I got to learn how to do search

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:54,700
plugins first I didn't know how to code

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:59,980
then I realised planets cannot solve

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:03,460
everything so I need to fix them yeah so

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,570
how to customize them and yeah and also

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,510
multi-site partition functions this is

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:14,680
seven years old website so just after

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:17,860
WordPress 3.0 when multi-site plastics

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,650
are was built to impress so much

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,230
information out there especially in

00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:27,690
Japanese so yeah I learned

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:33,520
a lot and then I did multiple modified

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:38,380
projects because I was white yeah like I

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:41,310
knew more than other people in Japan and

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,830
also I had a chance to communicate with

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:47,470
community people I didn't know how to

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:51,040
code so I asked them on the questions on

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,440
Twitter so I'd suddenly come up to one

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,270
press community in Japan and I mentioned

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,900
people okay you must know how to fix

00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:01,480
this this is the screen shot of error

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,180
this is the error message they started

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,700
like constantly so luckily they noticed

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,450
he's doing something we don't know

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:13,450
please they said you need to come to a

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,000
meeting and I went to a Metallica was

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:21,930
the first time I was evolving WordPress

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,560
community and also after published this

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:31,060
breezy of this a newspaper came to

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:34,030
feature this one some veterans came to

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:39,970
me I didn't get anybody like yeah I

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:45,810
learned how like world is moving how it

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:49,120
works so through this one tiny project I

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:54,730
learned a lot of things I got friends I

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:58,120
joined the community and so many many

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,600
things happened so this is the first

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,600
project

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:25,450
so these are yeah do you use WordPress

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:37,270
to host the fungus for now you can do

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:44,620
that and yeah yeah so who runs a blog in

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:49,420
this room like 10 like 30 percent so

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:53,440
it's as easy as what you're doing and it

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:57,610
has different effect so no one comes to

00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,820
your contest through content SEO because

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:05,530
they are non text but it's different and

00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:11,260
it's really interesting so so this is

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:15,250
the radio program about the life on the

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:22,180
island so it's me friends and my family

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:26,110
kids so we talk many things so this is

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,210
really a good way of recording your

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,820
fault

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:34,320
like what you're thinking at point of

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:41,880
your life so after moved on to this

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:45,900
and we see or I okay my house is too

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:49,590
loud for workplace what we do there is a

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:53,400
old house in front of my house that's 50

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:56,220
into a device something like that and me

00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:01,650
and my wife talked about and we

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,700
published it yeah and also he's fun to

00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:08,370
listen to

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:12,300
after many years also his he attracts

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:16,470
people who want to know what the island

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:20,780
is all about or like they just I get

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,780
interested and they come to my house

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:29,490
listen of this podcast can I talk and

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,930
yeah so this is really interesting this

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:36,360
is a cool one

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:40,680
it's not updated anymore but it's it's

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:46,170
all about online and move immigration to

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:50,520
Thailand so so I came to Thailand a

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:53,580
three week five seven years ago and I

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,560
owned a co-working space and I went

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,230
there and I saw a lot of people doing

00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,740
the same thing I was doing in Tokyo and

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,250
I thought okay

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,260
- this and that I went back to what I

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:09,490
want for my family okay are we going to

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,680
move here they said yeah so then we

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:16,450
started like a recording on stuff like

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:19,720
it's more like Ricola you just switch on

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:22,210
then you get an mp3 you install a plugin

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,970
to your WordPress and they uploaded and

00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:29,920
publish and so yeah so it's very easy

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,160
this helped me getting understood by

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,820
supporters like instead of okay we are

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:40,660
going to move to China you say something

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,970
you you share your thought and they

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,210
listen to when they come to you with

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:49,630
advice or you should be connected to

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:53,110
this person or you should prepare and I

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:56,070
have more information about that yeah so

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,070
it was really helpful

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,870
and also podcasts like them so you talk

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,750
a lot

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,080
than you need to explain many things to

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:13,980
your friends or your wife or even when

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,740
you like talking alone and that's a

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:21,110
really good way of hospital once you're

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,110
in what in your mind yeah

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,400
who's interested in

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,659
[Music]

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:43,590
yeah to tweet some plugins and set them

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,890
up but the question was how do you do

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:51,020
that and where mp3 files possibly I

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:53,310
share it on the same environment yeah

00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,800
yeah I don't want to maintain them so I

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,540
said on the shared hosting accounts

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,640
yeah and I

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,640
[Music]

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:11,630
yeah blow feed and XML so focus our like

00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:14,450
basically a different version of RSS so

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:24,230
yeah so I installed a plug-in to

00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:28,970
generate that feed okay next is Thailand

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:34,880
so I really do like this this is a view

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:40,030
from a heavy so he doesn't make sense

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,030
the fairies believe and this is the view

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:53,270
people we had about 350 we didn't have

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:59,060
Hotel Inns and etc and it's far from the

00:17:53,270 --> 00:18:11,920
mainland so we that people can on the

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:16,340
island so this is camp that one funny

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:19,790
problem we had works for the first time

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:23,000
attendees of workers so we announced we

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,820
were to have a work camp although people

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,510
culture

in a school gym yeah no air conditioner

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:07,440

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:16,520
so so that was fun we are planning to

00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:20,230
have next year not this year to do it

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,230
again oh sorry

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:38,410
yeah so this works because we didn't

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,530
have any catch means this is on the

00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:46,000
other we need to bring all the foods and

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:49,210
let them cook and yeah like a drinks and

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,960
everything we didn't have huge screen so

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:58,780
we built it that's how we did

00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:09,070
why go from this project so honestly he

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:11,610
was friends so I worked as a team since

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:16,390
we have only two people like water

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:22,179
workers related people 22 others from

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:24,700
outside of the moment nearby that was

00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:32,799
the only one time like face to face

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:36,429
meeting and I was reading on - yeah and

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,360
also like a bit different from other

00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:45,450
camps because we need to know who which

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:49,390
20 comes one time from which ferry and

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:55,809
switch in which tent and each is what

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:56,750
and well done when so we everyone like

00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:00,830
this

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,530
how's that he should work so this was a

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,230
really under two jobs compared to

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:13,100
thermal cam Tokyo which happened in the

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:16,640
middle of City yeah so really they are

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,440
all my friends I met some of them for

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,820
the first time in this project me and

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:26,120
published we are on student and you can

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:30,680
join they can't believe they are to the

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:33,550
website and such so yeah so I have only

00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,550
my name is reka

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:49,790
when I moved to China they didn't have

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:53,240
active activities so and since until

00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:56,660
then I learned a lot from the community

00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:01,250
so I wanted to learn again in Thailand I

00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:05,390
knew our talented developers so excited

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:08,630
to have an event once a month at the

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:11,660
co-working space I work and I just I can

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:16,190
continue doing that and here is the rest

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,820
of it a describes what was the struggle

00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,820
I had

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:32,389
so this is what this methyl group well

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:36,269
when is that the vapor that is I think

00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:39,960
2014 or something so the future of

00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:44,759
progress meter community what it is

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:50,610
so before we did our thing from the VCR

00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:58,519
I and the building and such I was facing

00:25:50,610 --> 00:26:02,100
about like really so language problem

00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,649
yeah this is what we did like how to

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,480
solve that problem together and we

00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:14,970
didn't talk about what was that we talk

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:23,299
about only humidity and I think this

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:28,110
picture is after the diamond and also

00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:29,909
yeah so you need to do many things by

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,789
yourself but I'm you need to talk to

00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:38,960
your friends to accomplish or like to

00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:38,960
continue something and if you

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:56,130
if you teacher there are to the members

00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:59,490
of the organizers of this podium so yeah

00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,940
I think if you keep doing it and focus

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:05,850
on communication and what they can do

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:09,240
that you can lead to such a great event

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:13,560
yeah yeah

00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,160
next is Uma this is an online version of

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:25,050
a meter

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:28,890
so the procedure twice a month and the

00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:31,040
one is a session like we say okay let's

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,780
talk about security let's talk about

00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,030
something and people comment give

00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,790
sessions and cure name another one is

00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:42,630
just communication you have a topic but

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:47,810
no one is giving sessions every time we

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:52,320
get 50 200 attendees and we run this by

00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:54,480
with six members and also we have

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,370
after-party and the good point of this

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,820
one is a drink and you don't need to get

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,400
on the taxi or train and to go back to

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,150
home

00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:10,300
because a belly band the problem behind

00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:13,090
me is it lasts like forever and if

00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:19,450
you're on a bar then someone comes to

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:32,280
you and hey we're closing in it so yeah

00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:34,900
we usually have this people around

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:39,429
actually Japanese people outside of

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:43,240
Japan console and press in their

00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:46,179
language regardless of where they are so

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,970
it's not a meet our ceremony for 60

00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:50,830
people is for locals like that's

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,470
sometimes very difficult if you're

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:58,840
really far from cities or you don't have

00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:00,730
any friends around you so I really

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,010
recommend you to do this like this is

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:06,220
very easy

00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:08,890
I'm planning to publish how we run this

00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:12,190
project and what you need to do to

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:17,290
promote to organize everything

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:19,570
no white and nesstra this is an example

00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,340
like we publish reports like what

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:24,880
happened what was discussed what was

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:29,559
taught and also we we caught them and

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:33,160
appeared on YouTube and Facebook and it

00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:36,280
has also the live streaming so we when

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,270
we start event we like strangers and so

00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:42,900
people

00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,900
and like find us really easy yeah

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:50,620
personally for me at the next one

00:29:46,120 --> 00:30:00,130
one camps and meet us is also a part of

00:29:50,620 --> 00:30:05,770
my personal project so okay so my life

00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:10,680
before I met the Lukas so I didn't know

00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:14,530
what I was doing I used to be a fancy

00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:17,680
civilian like minded Sonia and I worked

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,300
for him personally they went to a lot of

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,360
startups and then surprised with him

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,790
because he was a consultant and next job

00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:29,670
was a secretary of a parliament member

00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:32,170
and I hope them the election campaign I

00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:35,050
was also an account manager of a

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:38,400
creative agency the problem was like

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:45,370
mine I felt like I didn't fit in these

00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:49,570
jobs oh my god I really didn't know like

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:51,940
what I wanted I just felt like girl it's

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:56,580
not fun yeah

00:30:51,940 --> 00:31:01,450
and what I was doing accomplish a pretty

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:06,010
agency I meant I had one press for the

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:10,900
first line was a big project and we were

00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:14,740
preparing our proposal using Japanese

00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:17,080
companies and surprise CMS and the

00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,940
they came one person and he took the

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:23,169
world breasts project website project

00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:31,360
away from the consequence first of all a

00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:34,809
much cheaper features in it more than

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,580
that its presence so that was the first

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:44,160
time and when I knelt and then I got my

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:51,760
job this one when I had my first child

00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:59,140
it was okay I need to find a way to earn

00:31:51,760 --> 00:32:00,070
money by my own skill developers who

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,400
took the job for me

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:05,500
I mean a website project they was like

00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,640
super freedom people working individuals

00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:12,630
and I wanted to be like them because

00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:16,179
once the company is done I lose my job

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:18,100
other designers wouldn't eat my company

00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:21,100
and the ones who use WordPress

00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:24,429
they're like this you can get their jobs

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:27,970
somewhere else so it affected me a lot

00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:31,600
yeah and then I started building follow

00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:38,770
project learning WordPress and yeah

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:42,100
photo shops etc myself so so they tried

00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,700
on sports like you talk you need talk to

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,400
your friends

00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:49,700
the unique thing about so before

00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:52,190
relationship and life friends

00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:58,190
you need a lot of friends to run these

00:32:52,190 --> 00:33:02,690
projects and talk about fault

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:06,710
so asking a lot of wise if you run a

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:11,300
project if you come up with a an idea or

00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:14,210
maybe my visa why not write event is

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,720
funny like since you're investing your

00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:21,140
time in each question yourself why am I

00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,080
doing this like what's the purpose just

00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:28,510
fun it's fine if it's fine but I got

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:32,750
maybe sometimes not and also you need to

00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:35,930
write something on your website you need

00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,520
to outfit something and since no one is

00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:41,390
doing similar things

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:44,900
you need to like think that why why and

00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:48,110
also you talk to your friend page I need

00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:52,090
to do this with me then you need to

00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:54,260
explain the value the possible goals or

00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,590
how fun it is

00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:03,290
what's it what's the benefit for them

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:06,050
yeah three doing multiple projects you

00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:15,710
are thinking what you are doing what

00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:20,660
you're doing for me so the reason those

00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:23,080
projects like small ones will get to be

00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,230
friends with many people and with your

00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,630
fault

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,210
so that's my

00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:34,630
condition and did you notice all of my

00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:38,580
projects are run by wondrous see like at

00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:42,340
a median forecast parenting blog surveys

00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:45,970
zoom map etc Mecca we use compressible

00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,430
everywhere so you are very much divided

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:51,240
here you have one dress and you can do

00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:55,300
anything you want a lot of plugins and

00:34:51,240 --> 00:35:02,670
