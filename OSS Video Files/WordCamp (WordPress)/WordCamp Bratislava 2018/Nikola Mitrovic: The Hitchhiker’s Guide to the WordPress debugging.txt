Title: Nikola Mitrovic: The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the WordPress debugging
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: WordCamp Bratislava 2018
Description: 
	The things that can help beginners debug the most common issues in WordPress that are not easily found on Codex. During this talk we will cover the essentials of WordPress troubleshooting, using real life examples and tips & tricks. This lecture is suitable for anyone who builds or manages WordPress websites. The goal is to provide the proper set of troubleshooting steps, so attendees can solve common problems on their own.
Sharing my experience and giving advice that will save you a lot of time and headache in the future.
My talk is mostly focused on steps that one should take to find and resolve the issues that are most common. I will be talking about White Screen of Death, Plugin conflicts, PHP memory limit, etc. (I will probably add more examples), but the focus will be on how to approach the issue and resolve it.
Also, one part will be about useful tricks when migrating websites (and resolving the most common issues during the migration). That is a bit more advanced, but I will explain it in a way that regular WordPress user can understand. The idea is to help the average user tackle the possible migration issue without having to know technical stuff in depth.

I'm Nicola Madrid I come from Serbia

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,019
from godaddy bellmen office initially I

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,809
was a part of customer happiness team -

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,630
WP I know if anyone knows what - WP is

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:24,660
if anyone uses it it's a wordpress

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:28,140
management platform so ok oh sorry

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,820
if you don't hear me well just say so I

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,560
was part of the team that worked as

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,649
customer happiness engineer basically

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,460
it's a customer support but on a much

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,129
higher level

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,110
after that we teamed up go Daddy and I

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,850
became a project coordinator virtus

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,899
Academy Serbia being one of the project

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,820
that I am product owner off and I'm Suzy

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,809
as obviously I love working with

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,329
WordPress I work more than 3 years

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:55,829
exclusively on WordPress and I can say

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,620
that I have quite a bit of experience in

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:03,329
traversing websites why because that was

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:07,140
my job basically I probably fixed more

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,030
website then I created on my own so I'm

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,010
here to share my experience for you to

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,119
be easier when you when you come to an

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,500
issue with wordpress how to let's say

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,450
quickly resolve it so my best friend's

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,229
before I knew anything when I started in

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,909
WordPress was the word WordPress codex

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,670
will development handbook and my own

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,460
fear is through time why WordPress codex

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,430
and why developer can book it's not so

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,350
easy to find stuff there it's written

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,659
well but not so easy if you have problem

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,420
to fight anything there but if you find

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,020
a resolution on those two websites those

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,520
two knowledge bases you know that it is

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,049
by the rules because those two websites

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,710
are created by the WordPress community

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,540
and anything that you find there is

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,509
right the right way to do it so

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,549
basically if you are not familiar with

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,960
WordPress enough just go there and go

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,759
through there so okay this is the topic

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,220
of work in Bratislava

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,280
I find you're like Rebecca mr. bean and

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,530
it suit nicely with my presentation

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,300
because if you have a problem with

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,099
WordPress website the most important

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,450
thing is to have a backup if anything

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,879
happens to your website if you have a

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,040
good backup stored somewhere you can

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,550
easily restore a website to go on the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,420
website will be fine so let's talk about

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,310
WordPress debugging you all have issues

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,470
with WordPress websites right let me see

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,180
your hands if someone had an issue with

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:43,140
website website broke you for some

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:45,360
reason okay you know how there are two

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,160
important things to know when when

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,989
debugging WordPress website the first

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,450
and in my opinion the most important

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,980
thing is to know a WordPress

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,640
communicates with everything that's part

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,830
of the machine

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,780
so however purse communicates with deems

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,080
begins when you when you come across

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,920
some issue if you know what WordPress is

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,450
looking for you know or cannot find it

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,220
or it doesn't work properly and know

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,230
where to look for the culprit and

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,379
resolve it so that's the most important

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,690
thing

00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,330
learn how WordPress functions in its

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,060
core and the second important thing

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,340
WordPress has great Salutin tools so

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,890
don't be afraid to use them yes they

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,290
will be some coded messages and it might

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,360
be might be a bit harder to understand

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,260
but don't be afraid to use it because

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,510
when you know these values before I

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,580
before I continue so the only thing that

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,250
you need to do is open your WP config

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,489
file on your server and turn the debug

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,060
mode on once you do that if your website

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,129
has any issues the error messages will

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,860
be shown on your website so my

00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,840
recommendation is if you have a website

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,110
that has a lot of traffic don't do it

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,239
when it's the time when you have most

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,250
visitors to it overnight or do it on

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,480
your local machine have a copy of your

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,730
website and do it on your local machine

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,459
and fix all the issues there because the

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,510
error message will be shown and it can

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,510
be a security

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,320
security issue because someone will see

00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:17,489
the bad your server your files and it

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:20,459
can be used to do bad things so once you

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:23,250
have a mmm error code that you might not

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,930
understand what should you do like you

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,560
okay I see what's wrong but what should

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,050
I do next

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm not here to tell you this but it's

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,970
it's simple as that

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,950
google it because there there is a

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,330
chance that you're not the first one who

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:42,000
had the same issue and her purse is

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:45,420
strong and used oftenly because it has a

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,430
very strong community and it's almost

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,280
certain that somebody had the same issue

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,810
as you before and usually those guys

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,670
share their they're issued their

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,680
resolution so don't be afraid to google

00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:00,090
it and try it in your website but

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,890
obviously I'm not here to say okay how

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,470
to use Google I'm here to just go

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,470
through the common issues that you can

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,480
use WordPress regularly so you all know

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,150
this wide screen of dead hmm

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,540
are you familiar with this can I see

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,180
hands again anyone yeah yeah so that's

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,500
basically this is the only thing that

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,600
you can do when you when you see why

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,300
it's real that and why is that because

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,000
this is what you see and in most cases

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,470
when you turn on debugging mode in

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,210
WordPress if you have white spin of that

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,550
you cannot see the error message in most

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,030
cases sometimes again but it most cases

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,830
you cannot so you basically do not know

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,530
what's bugging your website what the

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,480
culprit was the issue the best thing

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,440
that it can help you there is experience

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,290
and so what what are the most common

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,600
issues that cause white skin of that in

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,970
my experience the most common issue is

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,919
theme or plugin interference so that's

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,020
the first thing the second thing is

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:05,190
exhausted PHP memory even though this

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,110
message this thing is often shown as a

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,419
as an error message on your website that

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,640
also can cause a white screen of that

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,590
and you know you don't know that that's

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,260
the thing that caused that and things

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,300
that can cause it as well and much

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,340
rarely than the first two are caching

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,870
plugins

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,760
you can resolve the issue caching

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,420
plugins the same way you will result in

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,550
for crying interference in a bit the

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,050
hosting server issues and you cannot put

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,690
anything there except contact your

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,340
hosting provider and you have an issue

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,140
with your website sanitation resultant

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,300
and the last thing issue with WordPress

00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,400
core files that's a bit tricky

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,960
I usually resolve that with restoring my

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,060
backup I know that people try to just

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,040
replace WordPress core files with the

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,830
clean installation and they keep

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,520
wp-content folder and that sometimes

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:59,340
work sometimes it can break even worse

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,870
so it's not my recommendation to do it

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,050
my recommendation is have a backup

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,990
really so ok let's see when we have a

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,940
tumor plugin interference you cannot

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,310
when you have a wide-scale that you

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,110
cannot get your website back end and if

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,790
you if you have a plug-in interfere with

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,380
your website the first thing that you

00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,510
should do logically is to deactivate

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,070
that plug-in and the website should be

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,280
back live again but you cannot get your

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,620
back-end and how the activator and this

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,800
is where knowing how WordPress works

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,630
come in come handy because if you know

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,640
how WordPress searches for plugins and

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,110
if you know how WordPress communicate

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,810
with them you will know that you can

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,670
find all your plugins if you have a

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,610
regular installation you can find all

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:44,340
your plugins in wp-content folder and

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,780
plants so that's where WordPress looks

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,730
for all your plugins on your website

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:52,650
just go to your server and do what just

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,600
named plugins plugins folder - plugins

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,510
not old or whatever you want just don't

00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,790
let it be called plugins and once you do

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,770
that WordPress will not find any plugins

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,470
on your website and automatically all

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,790
your plugins will be deactivated if

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,060
plugins were the problem

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,920
your absent will be back live it will

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,840
not look it it's supposed to look

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,910
because you don't have plans that will

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,980
provide you with some core functionality

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,440
for your website but you will know that

00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,480
one of the plugins sees the main issue

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,480
and that's what causing the quite clear

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,850
that once you know that what's next

00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,380
okay rename the folder back to parties

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,090
and WordPress will know where to find

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,680
your plugins again but this time or the

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,659
we'll be deactivated they will stay

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,460
deactivated workers will just find it

00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,279
again because you renamed it back to

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,409
plants once they are divided deactivated

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,419
you will be able to get your website

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,000
back-end so you will be able to go to

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,640
plugins page and do what logically

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,100
activate - one by one when you do that

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,110
after activating blogging that caused

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,600
the issue in the first plane place the

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,100
issue will reappear basically you will

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,570
know that the last plug in this

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,220
reactivated before they usually appear

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,830
does the plug-in that that's causing the

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,330
issue so that's the way to resolve if

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,700
you have a plug-in interference but what

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,130
about teams if you have a team

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,830
interference what do you think what can

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:19,360
you do can you do the same thing to

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:22,000
rename the team's folder no why yeah

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,800
that's right so the first thing that you

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,040
know that you should know you have to

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,960
have at least two teams the purpose has

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,000
to have the backup team if your team

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,740
does not work workers has to have a team

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,110
to work you don't have to have any

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,760
buttons your recipe can work without

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,920
plugins but it cannot work without theme

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,990
so basically you cannot just rename the

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,390
teams to team stock all but you can do

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,830
something else to replace the team

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,140
that's going currently active and

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,540
potentially causing issues you can go to

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,300
PHP my admin and get to your database

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,940
database that your website is using find

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,490
WP auctions table and when you do that

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,880
change values for template and style

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,880
sheet to default 27:15 if you don't have

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,440
2017 installed on your website just use

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,810
the other team that you have installed

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
but the main thing here is to change the

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,110
theme that's currently active and

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,029
causing an issue I'll show you how it

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,250
looks okay so you see here option name

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:21,490
style sheet it's changed to 2017 you

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,160
have to find the same row but where

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,890
option name is template and change that

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,570
to 2017 as well if your website is alive

00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,150
after that the team was causing the

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,380
issue now when you find a plug-in that's

00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,910
causing the issue and when you find a

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,730
team that's causing the issue there are

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:39,040
three things that you can do first thing

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,100
you can try to debug it yourself for

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,480
example a revolution slider anybody uses

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,690
revolutions lighter

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,930
I had a problem with that plugin we PHP

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:53,230
seven it was not compatible with PHP HB

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,450
7 so I had to find the part of the code

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,600
where they're using arrays and just

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,010
change would be a p7 they of course

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,930
change that in the next version of

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,460
plugging they fixed it by themselves but

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,090
I couldn't wait for them side things to

00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,410
myself

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,860
that's one thing to do fix it yourself

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,780
but it can be sorry for my language

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,970
painting yes you don't have to do that

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,560
the next thing that you can do you can

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,800
find another plugin that that's the same

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,380
thing and works well with your website

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,180
you can contact free to contact the

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,570
author of the volume it's great to tell

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,160
someone that's investing their dumb time

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,150
and resources to create a plugin for you

00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,190
it's great to tell them that they have

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:35,350
an error and it's great to let them know

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,970
that they should fix it it all means the

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,560
same for the team so you can find it on

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,940
our team but it's best to contact the

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,970
author and let them know that their team

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,040
is not working well for you okay the

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,040
next thing that if because this is PHP

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,290
memory exhaustion issue because I worked

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,180
in I worked in customer happiness teams

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,790
so we had a lot of questions where we

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,770
found out that PHP memory is exhausted

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,810
and that's why the website is not

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,600
working and usually we get back an

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,520
answer with a screenshot that okay I

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,070
have enough storage on my on my server

00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,530
like I have 10 gigabytes and I only used

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,810
500 megabytes the first thing that you

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,030
should know PHP memory is not a storage

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,790
in your server you can look at it as a

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,140
RAM memory for your website and whenever

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,450
you activate to another plugin or

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,060
another team it grabs a little bit of

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:26,940
that memory and uses it and it will come

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:29,500
time when you have for example 512

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,360
megabytes of PHP memory and when you

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,610
activate the plug-in next plug-in and

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,180
you go over that limit your site will

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,380
break and it's not the plugins fault its

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,870
fault of all plugins collectively

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,360
because each one of them takes a bit of

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,880
that space and when you go out your your

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,100
else is done it will not work so what

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,800
you can do the first thing you can try

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,320
to increase PHP memory limit in your WP

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,430
config file and it's a simple one line

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,860
of code define WP memory

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,910
and you put the number that you think

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:05,920
that you need if you have 256 megabytes

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:09,350
you just increase it to etc if you

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,990
increase it one gigabyte etc if the

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,690
server allows WordPress to do that your

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,790
website will work again but if not you

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,029
should try to find PHP file on your

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,730
server not all servers have that

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:26,630
possibility so if you have a server that

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,760
you manage yourself you can you can find

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,770
this find this file and change your

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,839
memory limit like this but if you cannot

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,250
find this be free to contact your

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:42,440
hosting provider because they are the

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:46,130
ones that should change okay about event

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,050
stuff in my opinion yes advanced but can

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:53,649
be quite useful I don't know if any one

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:57,950
of you here to migrate the website yeah

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:59,480
it can be paying you can migrate

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,430
websites when you exchange hosting

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,110
provider or you have a template that you

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,020
use to deploy a new website for example

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,550
you often create in shops ecommerce and

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,589
you have a template that you use often

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,120
Lea you will use that template to deploy

00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,400
your new website quickly and make some

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,839
small changes for for the new planet and

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,400
you can use different tools for that WP

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,060
being one of them so you can plan the

00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,520
website using mainly premium I don't

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,800
know if there is any free tool that does

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,910
the job well but there is always an

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,620
option to do it for free by yourself and

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:36,650
there are few things that can cause

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,800
issues when you try to make my regular

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,510
website man first being timeouts and

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,600
transferring files if your website is

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:46,190
big and your server destination sir is

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,200
not so well

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,860
it will timeout and you won't be able to

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,779
transfer the files easily the second and

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,300
more often this happens you will help

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:58,190
troubles importing the database if your

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,920
database has for example one gigabytes

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,350
in size you will have issues important

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,589
database because the connection will

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,700
break basically is a lot in the

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:10,910
connection will break and you will not

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,010
be able to well the necessary files but

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,110
not the database and the third thing is

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:19,190
changing URLs on the destination if the

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:23,000
destination has another domain so you

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:25,550
pretty much because all those things can

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,779
be overcome quite easily

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:32,660
ha ok first for server timeouts when you

00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:35,420
have SSH access for ports both servers

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,699
you can basically use servers bandwidth

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,190
to reduce the time needed to transfer

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,910
the files and how do you do it using

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,940
rsync

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:46,970
and this is stuff that I'm told that are

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,070
advanced I think that you don't have to

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,699
have developing developer knowledge

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:56,270
because I basically don't I cannot say

00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:57,529
that I am experienced developer you

00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,480
don't have to have the developer

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,760
knowledge to use all of those things you

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,900
only need one or two lines of code and

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,640
the things would work so you can use it

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,709
by using your you know and it's not

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,810
scary at all I'll show you now so open

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:13,610
your terminal on your computer and the

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,380
first thing that you need to do you need

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,360
to if you have SSH access for your

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,160
source server you need to connect it up

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:24,430
that server and this is how you do it

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:26,020
it's simple as that just put in SSH and

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,900
[Music]

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,430
server and coast from your server and

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,650
you'll be prompted to enter your

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:37,339
password once you do you will you will

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:39,740
basically log in like using FileZilla or

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:42,079
cyberduck it's the same thing just doing

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,470
it from the terminal once you do that

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:48,110
just place the following command and

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,230
that's it wait for wait for magic to

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,900
happen why because you you say the

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,690
server key ok I'm using our scene I want

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,360
the source folder if you are in website

00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,990
root the source folder is for example

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,390
public

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:05,300
EML / the wordpress if your source

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:08,240
website is their type public HTML / /

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,120
press here and this is the destination

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,650
server this is Cal you'll let the

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,660
computer know it should connect to the

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,120
destination server and transfer the

00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,079
files there so user of the destination

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,120
server host of the destination server

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,059
and destination folder if you want to

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,220
transfer the files to public HTML as

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,290
well just type public HTML and that's it

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,080
type enter it will prompt you for

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,030
destination servers password if you have

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,490
the correct password it will transfer

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,350
the files for you and this part here

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,570
just tells them to do the things for you

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,020
that you probably should do manually and

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:52,010
this is the thing that reduces the time

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:53,780
archive zip zip zip files when when it

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,010
should be transferred and after that we

00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,320
will extract the files on your

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,030
destination server this P stands for

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,520
progress you can track the progress of

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,920
what's happening to see if it's on 15%

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,480
or if it's done and that's it once you

00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,340
do that you have all the files that you

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,840
need on the destination the next thing

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,910
that you should do you should report

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:16,429
database if the database is quite big

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:23,510
you will have time outs and I find okay

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:28,670
you have SQL file this thing I see there

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:34,630
is a script called victim I don't know

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:34,630
who is and it's a free script you want

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:47,270
how divided the SQL file with small

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,520
pieces and it basically imports small

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,940
chunks and restarts the process so it

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,790
doesn't let the server panel if we

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,090
starts out through every small chunk and

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:02,570
it can take a while but it will get data

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:05,090
so after that you have files you have a

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,370
database your website is ready except if

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,040
you want to change the URL for the

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,650
destination if the first website calm

00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,790
and the second website is demo calm you

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:19,940
have to change the URLs in your database

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:23,380
the first easier ways install them the

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,380
destination search and replayed money

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,600
but it doesn't work always so I added up

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,210
I call it the advanced method but it

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,940
really isn't it's quite easy you can

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,790
find the the SQL query that you need to

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,919
to run on the internet so you can copy

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:42,530
it from I from my presentation as well

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,840
just go to destinations phpMyAdmin

00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,190
select the database if you database is

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,950
there select the database that you need

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:54,440
and paste this SQL query into the SQL

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,260
tab in the PHP environment and I'll show

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,450
you how it looks right now so you select

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,570
the database here and you have structure

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:05,570
a search query not important in SQL tab

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,340
just paste the code in let me go back

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,980
you'll see that this is sort calm

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,230
destination calm the only thing that you

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,080
need to change this if your first steps

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,880
it is example.com change it here if your

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,490
destination is demo dot-com change it

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,450
here and run and that's it that worked

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:27,140
fine for you and my final recommendation

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,610
so we talked about the debug mode to

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,860
turn it on in WordPress we talked about

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,330
when plugin is causing an issue okay

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:36,740
activate all plugins so you will know if

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,240
you will know that it's the issue and

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,520
you will know which one is when

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,960
activating plugins one by one there is a

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,500
plugin that can do all that all of that

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,640
for you

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,200
it's called he'll check plugin and you

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,940
have all information about your website

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,490
and about your server so you will know

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,390
with this plan you will know what's your

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,950
PHP memory limit if you have 256

00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,750
megabytes you will know about this play

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,870
and anyone know if that's the issue okay

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:04,730
I will increase it to 512

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,770
second great thing about this this

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,809
plug-in is easy troubleshooting mode if

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,690
you enter troubleshooting mode with one

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,970
click the plug-in will deactivate all -

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,190
for you it will activate in wp-config

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,530
troubleshooting mode so you will be able

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,980
to see the error by yourself and you can

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,809
do all

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,130
that took place so you can do it

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:24,470
manually but this is my recommendation

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,730
it will save you a lot of time if you

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,910
have a lot of issues with it with your

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,910
websites do you have any questions

00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:39,590
nobody really need no questions at all

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,590
okay

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:46,549
so that's it for me thanks a lot this is
