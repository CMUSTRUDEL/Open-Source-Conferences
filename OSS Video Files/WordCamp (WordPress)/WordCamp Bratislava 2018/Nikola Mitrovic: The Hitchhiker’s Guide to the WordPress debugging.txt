Title: Nikola Mitrovic: The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the WordPress debugging
Publication date: 2019-04-12
Playlist: WordCamp Bratislava 2018
Description: 
	The things that can help beginners debug the most common issues in WordPress that are not easily found on Codex. During this talk we will cover the essentials of WordPress troubleshooting, using real life examples and tips & tricks. This lecture is suitable for anyone who builds or manages WordPress websites. The goal is to provide the proper set of troubleshooting steps, so attendees can solve common problems on their own.
Sharing my experience and giving advice that will save you a lot of time and headache in the future.
My talk is mostly focused on steps that one should take to find and resolve the issues that are most common. I will be talking about White Screen of Death, Plugin conflicts, PHP memory limit, etc. (I will probably add more examples), but the focus will be on how to approach the issue and resolve it.
Also, one part will be about useful tricks when migrating websites (and resolving the most common issues during the migration). That is a bit more advanced, but I will explain it in a way that regular WordPress user can understand. The idea is to help the average user tackle the possible migration issue without having to know technical stuff in depth.
