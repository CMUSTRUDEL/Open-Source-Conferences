as you can see today I'll be talking

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,240
about how you can take how you can use

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,559
Google Analytics to take the most out of

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,889
your website so if you've any questions

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,109
I prepared a time slot at the end of the

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,260
presentation so you can add any

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,630
questions and also the presentation is

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,640
online I put it a short link on my

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,109
profile on Twitter so if anybody is

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,140
interesting in the presentation you can

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,330
find it even now if there is any Wi-Fi

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,399

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,950

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,230

be it for used to you so the plan talk

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,059
was about four to five minutes we'll

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,610

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,170
hour and hopefully I set up the last

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,230

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,340

they expect today to find out what's

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,380
that one thing that you would actually

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,479

he'll try to run late hopefully okay

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:12,270
then maybe this way are you looking for

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,170
more for introductory wear into Google

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:19,030

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,160
people and for the advanced okay much

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,720
more okay then you'll like the second

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,340
part of the presentation and I'll rush

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,160
to that part very I'm talking about

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:34,930
intro to Google Analytics so let's dive

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,400
in so before I actually want to talk

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,440
about Google Analytics I want to start

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,720
but the main question how you can get

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,670
the most out of your website so Google

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,080
Analytics is just one of the tools it's

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,670
not the complete solution it's not

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,460
what's going to give you a better

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,980
website so how do you get the most out

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,560
to your website you ask the right

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,570
questions you need to ask the right

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,550
questions in order to analyze and get

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,550
the real answers so what are the right

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,560
questions and actually a calling just

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,450
had a presentation and he talked about

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,310
what actually a couple of questions they

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,890
need to be answered before you can have

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,320
any sort of a meaningful campaign so

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,200
what are those question what do I want

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,240
to accomplish and we freelancer do we

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,180
have a Content block am i maintaining a

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,850
website for somebody else are your web

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,680
shop are you market here so what is who

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,780
are you and what do you want to

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
accomplish by the Google Analytics if

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,420
you're working for somebody else or your

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,640
own website and you do that by defining

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,950
who you are and what you want to achieve

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,850
the more you pick a measurable goal and

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,160
then smart methodology comes in the

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,930
better you define your goal the much

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,250
more it will be easier to use the Google

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,910
Analytics or another tool to achieve

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,620
your business objective so another good

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,780
question next question is what is the

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,480
goal of website is it to bring more

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,090
users to browse your content

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,010
do you sell over your website do you

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,640
have a membership plan how you software

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,350
service are uning commerce are you some

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,800
sort of company just need the front face

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:11,590
do you need a portal so based on that

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,650
you'll set up goals for traffic's for

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,850
conversions or for your sales and using

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,070
Google Analytics you could do a pretty

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,859
good job of all that I'm going to deal

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,930
in that later next really important

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:25,210
question is who's your target audience

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,350
where are they from what the day

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,240
location

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,300
what technology they're using what their

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,160
age are they made other female you know

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,350
most of this question actually can be

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,290
answered to Google Analytics and I know

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,260
for experience that in almost 90% of the

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,650
cases the companies have one perception

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,570
on who's their target onion is and

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,160
reality is completely different so what

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,420
they pictured is that ideal per customer

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,910
or ideal butter buyer or ideal reader

00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:59,890
almost always let a lot of things so

00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:02,320
with what actual analytics shows next

00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,050
question is to understand the users so

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,530
do I have the right content and when

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,180
engaging my audience and are they happy

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,860
with what I found website they stay in

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:18,490
do they read they just leave so am i

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,290
successfully shown on my website what I

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:25,330
entered it do I engage with my users

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:27,160
correctly next big question Google

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,040
Analytics is probably not the best tool

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,340
for this but it's my website working

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,640
well is it user friendly what's hit

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,490
speed does it crash how many years does

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,750
it take one of the actual important

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,930
question that's also connected to

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,970
hosting usually hosting plans have a

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,040
limit for traffic or for users per month

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,020
and you can actually track Google

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,520
Analytics company which you have a how

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,200
many users do you have or how much

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,860
traffic bandwidth you are spending and

00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,870
then then actually help you to go to the

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,580
bigger hosting plan before your website

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,650
crashes and finally what's Google

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,300
Analytics really good is how are you

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,910
measuring success once we have a

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,470
strategy once we know who we are what

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,510
we're trying to achieve who's the target

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:18,880
audience and am I did am i created Mike

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:21,070
everything that content and products on

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,130
my site and it's working well then how

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,280
am i measuring if I'm succeeding do I

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,420
meet my objectives is myself high enough

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,220
imagine what I said to achieve and

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,230
Google Analytics is really really good

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,380
on that part in order to have that you

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,900
need to have a right measurement plan

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,420
and measurement plan comes out of what

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,560
you ever set up as your KPIs your

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,380
sobriety is what you're trying to

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,470
measure this slide here is for one

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:50,050
specific reason I'm going to talk how

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,550
you can easily implement in internet

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,020
Google Analytics into your website and

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:58,060
how you can configure it but also this

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,820
sentence right here make sure that

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,860
you're aware of limitations Google

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,840
Analytics is not all comes in tool it's

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,690
very useful tool for a free tool it has

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,240
a lot of stuff but you have to be aware

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:13,200
of its limitations so let's start by

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,800
defining what it can do and what it is

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:21,390
so can anybody tell me or does anybody

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,390
want to tell me what Google Analytics is

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:32,290
anybody okay our audience it's the

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,630
tracking solution so you basically use

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,750
it to track what your users are doing on

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,460
your website and how does it work and

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,100
what can be tracked we're going to

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,570
answer in the next couple of slides so

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,930
basically let's say you're a visitor you

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:49,540
come to the website the server on which

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,640
your website is hosted sense has a

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,980
little small part of the javascript that

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,170
sends the tracking code and checks if

00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,110
you have a cookie on your website if you

00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,300
already had Google Analytics cookie in

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,480
case you didn't you're served with one

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,040
if yes you are then your continue to be

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,410
tracked and that special ID that you

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,510
have in your cookie and basically to

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,870
that a lot of information is sent back

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,420
and on the website it's tracked which

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,460
user is actually doing what visiting

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,750
browsing clicking and all the action

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,570
that you can actually track with Google

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,960
Analytics all that information is sent

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,490
on Google servers and after that is

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,210
compiled and you can see it in your

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,040
analytics reporting so what can we track

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,280
with Google Analytics this is a pretty

00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,690
confusing let's say picture and it's

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,790
then little bit that way because

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,250
Internet is really not that structured

00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:45,160
and organized but let's say in the

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,020
center that's your website and users can

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,730
actually access it and see it on their

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,830
mobile device on the tablet on their

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,140
laptops and their computers and you can

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,070
see that to Google Analytics you can

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,170
else actually

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,060
also understand who's your user are they

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,280
male or the female where they from what

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,190
they interest what are they doing under

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:06,040
your website and you can also see where

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,440
they came from are that is that our blog

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,660
is touring email if you have a campaign

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,730
over Google or Facebook did somebody

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,130
recommended you on the other website to

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:18,040
affiliate marketing or other banners you

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,050
can analyze all that and as a funnel we

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,230
can actually analyze what they are doing

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,700
on websites what pages are they visiting

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,350
that are they purchasing are they really

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,650
something are they doing any sort of

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,450
reaction that you will find beneficial

00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,550
and this is one of those interesting

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,820
slides that are connected to back up

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:40,630
that we were all required or required to

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,460
put in our presentations always have a

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,740
back up and I'm going to show you in

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,710
Google Analytics one of the few things

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,620
that people most usually miss and don't

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,600
think and that is back up views you need

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,190
to have backup or real data because it

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,720
can easily happen that you lose some

00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:01,150
through the filtering so I'm going to go

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,060
through integration and setup of Google

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,500
Analytics in couple of steps easiest way

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,330
to interview Google Analytics for those

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,870
beginners that are looking just for that

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,490
beginning stuff is to use a plugin one

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,620
of the most used plugins in Constance

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,810
type in sets and it pretty good it's

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,820
really simple you get the code you put

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,560
it in and plug in your Google Analytics

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,470
is connected and you start receiving to

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,860
your data another much better

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,240
integration is the Google tag manager

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,430
you need to integrate your code into

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,400
Google tag manager and entry tag manager

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,990
a website it's a bit more technical so

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,720
it's not covered into this presentation

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,860
but I recommend is this method because

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,290
once you integrate Google tag manager

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,990
you think in create a lot of other stuff

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,900
to it so not just Google Analytics but

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,790
Facebook pixel custom tags custom script

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,960
a lot of other stuff that you can do in

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:56,290
your own and it's super flexible and now

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,630
to the part of the backups most people

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,190
just install Google Analytics so one of

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,620
the pro tips I would I would say it's

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,200
all we have a backup you so the first

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,730
view that's generated by default once

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,660
you just go into Google Analytics if you

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,610
go into admin if you

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,410
in property you will see that you can

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,780
actually create multiple views and for

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,780
each video you have a filter or a

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,090
condition under which the traffic is

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,830
filtered out why don't you need help

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,570
backup you because if you set up your

00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,080
filter incorrectly any time in the

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,550
future you will lose all the object data

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,640
so it pays out to have a filter that's

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,950
not set up and for the main view I also

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,410
recommend that you always filter out

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,330
internal traffic because in a couple of

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,550
ages is that the work done that hasn't

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,260
been done properly so if you have an

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,820
agency let's say 20 workers that are

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,260
constantly on their website looking for

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,290
offers looking for content doing

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:50,200
something that will inflate your website

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,360
visits much and you will actually have a

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,050
hard time differential what are the real

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,800
users and what are your employees and

00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,860
exclude all non BOTS

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,110
spider's bots you know the Google is

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,320
crawling your website for content each

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,790
day other girls are also out there and

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,470
they're crawling your website and you

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,630
can actually filter them out your out of

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:14,080
it as results so you don't have employee

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,400
figures and also activate demographic

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,990
and interests report that will actually

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,380
tell you that what I was talking about

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,090
the users when you can actually see if

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,010
they are male if they are female what

00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:27,150
their location and most importantly what

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,950
that interested what their interests are

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,570
so let's talk a little bit but now we

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,700
get in Google Analytics and I'm going to

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,650
rush through this a little bit because

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,350
you were more interesting in more

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,150
advanced stuff but for just for those

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,620
that are actually using them or starting

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,450
using Google Analytics this is some of

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,320
the main things that you need to be

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:50,680
aware of and understand so first thing

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,330
is the navigation navigation is on the

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,000
left of your dashboard this is called

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,870
Airport look when you join domain

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,370
there's purview

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,600
once you open your account once you

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,640
integrate the Google Analytics on your

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,560
website much you go into your account

00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,570
this is how it looks like and these are

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,740
the five main categories then you can

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,620
actually see on your left side

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:13,060
so it's real-time audience acquisition

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,380
behaviors and conversions there are some

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,400
more important than others

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,920
and there's a lot of in there but let me

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,380
try just to cover the most

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,600
and stuff so the first thing most people

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,269
see when they go in the first report and

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,310
I believe that's an acquisition tab and

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,649
overview so this is the sum of the first

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,440
information that is shown these are the

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,760
visits there's a nice pie chart but

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,300
these are the important things that you

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,920
need to be aware of so one of the most

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,630
key elements that you need you will

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,389
learn over time to Google only takes

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,670
water sessions what are visitors what is

00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,410
visitor ID what a conversion all the

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,260
terminology can you learn to time but

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,060
for the beginning were average user that

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,860
owns blog did he have the content and

00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,260
post it for somebody else I think it's

00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,410
super critical to understand which blog

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,500
articles are performing better on which

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:06,870
articles the readers are visitor are

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,470
actually staying on and which are just

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,820
leaving from so for the follow all that

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,800
information you actually need to

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,600
understand this users is the number of

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,610
users that are actually visited your

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,430
website in a specific time that you

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,199
chosen sessions a number of sessions the

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,980
time the time they came to your site

00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:28,399
session is not the same as the user page

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,829
views are not a number of pages or

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,959
viewed pages on your website this is

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,510
every pages possession average session

00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,029
duration bounce rate and new sessions

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,560
user chance is important if your goal of

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,630
your website is to actually to attract

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,519
new users so that's super important for

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,470
those but those that are like say

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,480
software service maybe not as much

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,920
because most of your audience will be

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,519
people that come back to log into your

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,060
service bounce rate is one of the less

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,320
important measures because it shows the

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,260
amount of users that came to your

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,600
website and left immediately so that

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,240
happens most often Lee when you have a

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,470
campaign and your campaign your ad it's

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,720
not in the sync with what the user

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,339
expects so quick clicks the ad comes to

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,930
your website and navigates away from it

00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:16,279
immediately

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,990
word of warning this is pretty high and

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:23,850
also if you see bounce rates that are

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:25,970
really low like 3% 4% 6% most likely you

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,399
didn't integrate Google Analytics

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,079
properly and I say that for the number

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,819
of website at a public web site that's

00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,859
pretty low figure if

00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:40,379
have a internal portal that people need

00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:43,769
to log on then this will be super low so

00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:45,359
the next one date if you're on a free

00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:47,100
version of Google Analytics you can

00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:50,009
choose a date under which you will

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,439
analyze everything there's preset

00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:56,189
conditions like 37 days but you can

00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:58,439
choose whatever you like and why is this

00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:00,569
important because for Google Analytics

00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:01,069
for free version Google actually after

00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:04,519
you

00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:08,129
select large enough a large enough time

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,109
in the past so over 60 days or 90 days

00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:13,649
they actually aggregate your pictures so

00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:16,079
you will not be shown actual results but

00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:19,229
approximation of the results because for

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,869
free accounts they don't actually save

00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:24,569
everything they save a great table so

00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:26,759
let's say it's a guess work based on the

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:29,119
last last amount of data that you have

00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,119
on your website

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,739
and now we can talk about understanding

00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:38,100
each of those let's say categories on

00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:39,959
the left and the first one is audience

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,179
your customers like we said we need to

00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,799
understand who our customers are where

00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,889
are they coming from what they using and

00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:50,009
that's all of these let's say options

00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:51,779
once you go into audience of course

00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,389
there isn't enough time to go everything

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:57,029
and it will be not really relevant to

00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,709
every one of you so I would like just to

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,659
go over a couple of things that are

00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,699
important both for the people that are

00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:05,879
new at this both of the people that have

00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:08,370
on some advanced integrations so we just

00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:10,919
explained all the basic stuff one

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:14,549
actually think that would be super

00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:18,029
useful is to understand where your users

00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:19,980
coming from who are they and the best

00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:22,409
results are actually shown once you

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,250
start using these segments custom

00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:28,649
segments so let's say you go on an eShop

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,899
or there is a blog on your site and

00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:32,789
you're also selling something it doesn't

00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:34,710
make sense to look at your entire

00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:36,929
audience it makes sense to look at the

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,490
segments of your audience and let's say

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,549
those are people that actually purchased

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,200
something so lets you just if you're not

00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:44,970
paying attention to that and you just

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,520
look at your entire audience

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:51,120
you'll see people across the board from

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,770
18 years to 55 years but let's say you

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,440
look at the people who show up on your

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,440
website and you suddenly discover is not

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,730
just male and female it's mainly female

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,740
35 to 45 years old and your audience is

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,990
not actually everybody but the specific

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,420
segment and you actually find that out

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,300
if you look at your if you segment the

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,370
data you see on this screen and you just

00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,030
look at the people that converted bought

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,830
something on your website and you can

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,570
actually find out about the specific

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,850
audience but then going into chemical

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:26,460
and location report there's a lot of

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,370
information here and there are actually

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:32,100
some beta testing around lifetime

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,810
r-value and cohort analysis Coker

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,700
tonality is actually super useful if

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:42,830
does any of you have software service

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,830
nobody how many of you are we the block

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:53,670
and he shops so couple people yeah about

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:55,770
the same amount of audience so if your

00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,660
niche shop lifetime value is super

00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,550
important but in order to have that you

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,680
need to have a conversion setup and

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,330
actually value for risk aversion pumped

00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,480
back into Google Analytics I'll talk

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,210
about it in that advanced part if you're

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,280
on the other hand software service coho

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,100
technology super super interesting

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,410
because it shows how cohort specific

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,540
people that join in specific time are

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,610
they declining are are they leaving your

00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,370
service and you can analyze each month

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:26,790
or each week do this beta testing tool

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,890
that's right now in a testing page also

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,600
here is usually Explorer that you can

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,030
actually explore it session for each

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,270
users this intersection is actually

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:39,030
shown if you turn on that advanced part

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:41,850
I told in a first another slide I think

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:44,850
about what you need turn on once you

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,470
integrate Google Analytics behavior a

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,210
little bit about them what technology

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,020
they are using are they coming over

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:55,500
which devices desktop laptop mobile and

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,280
there are additional options that you

00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,870
need to have a little bit more technical

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,940
to go in and set up you can actually set

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,340
up your own custom feel that you want to

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,740
track about them and you can also use

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,690
cutting dimensions and addition started

00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,190
you can also benchmark to this tool but

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,730
for the benchmarking you would actually

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,860
need to write your own JavaScript code

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,370
in order to benchmark some sort of part

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,370
of your audience

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,510
the acquisition we don't have a picture

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,040
similar dashboard look these are the

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,470
main thing that you need to be aware of

00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,930
the position wise acquisition super

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,990
important how many of you have any sort

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:39,250
of marketing campaigns over agencies

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:41,710
that you do them yourselves I find that

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,990
the Angels after them let's say CEO part

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,850
some sort of advertising is key if you

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:50,380
want to increase the view of your

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,700
website simple SEO is not that efficient

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,700
in the beginning especially if your site

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,520
is young and for the either opening an

00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,590
eShop or any sort of commercial you'll

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,810
need to have a marketing campaign so

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,660
this one this report acquisition is

00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:07,600
super important for that and you need to

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,150
set up your channels right because you

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,790
need to group them in order to idolize

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,450
them better so Google has its own

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:19,300
default set up and it's mainly social

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:22,480
AdWords referrals paid was actually

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,820
shown a picture and you can actually

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,800
dive deeper with those source and medium

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,200
analyze it you can also analyze it if

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,570
you have AdWords if you connected your

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,640
Google account to search console you can

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,830
also see that and why it's also

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,980
important because you can analyze those

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,980
campaigns specifically each campaign so

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,230
if you are working with an agency this

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,920
would be a really good way to test are

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:50,620
they doing the job why because I'm not

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,330
sure what houses here in Slovakia but we

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,000
have a lot of digital agencies in Serbia

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,560
and basically they come to the small

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,060
business owner and say oh I'm going to

00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,050
make you great campaign you're going to

00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,520
look good you're going to be an

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,870
Instagram you're going to be on YouTube

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,550
to everybody to see you every but if

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,910
click on the ad you will have thousands

00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,440
of people coming to your website and

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,400
then how you can actually test it

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,010
well the Google

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,080
- for this you can actually see it

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,790
through this you can actually see you

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,770
tagged each campaign and you know

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,620
exactly over which campaign or each

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,320
website or each mark marketing channel

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,440
did your customer come to you one of the

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,380
actually really important things Google

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,910
has its own automatic tagging so for

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,530
most of their campaigns you get

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,809
automatic tags on which they actually

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,180
can track of which channel person game

00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,460
but it's a big recommendation that you

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,980
use UTM coding for all of your bank

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,670
campaigns both on Facebook was on Google

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:50,760
block these banners so how many of you

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:53,559
are actually using UTM codes few of you

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,780
and then I'm British

00:22:53,559 --> 00:23:00,750
sorry I didn't include the link there's

00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:04,210
a UTM building tool that actually builds

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:07,270
like a sentence that go behind the URL

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,429
of your landing page and you attach it

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,520
to your campaign and then you can note

00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:14,890
exactly over which campaign over which

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,600
ad person came to your website and you

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,929
can see the ad analyze that in this

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,330
acquisition part of the Google Analytics

00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:24,760
so if you're not using it write it down

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,270
or remember to look at the presentation

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,000
later UTM tagging is a must I would say

00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,040
for marketing campaigns either if you do

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,990
them yourself or if you're working with

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,780
external agency request that they do

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,950
this it's two minutes of work and then

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,929
you can track the results much

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,830
miraculous that you that you would do

00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:43,830
with the default installation

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:52,660
so there it was and here is the analysis

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,150
of the channels that are grouped by

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,150
default paid search organic search

00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,890
direct social display and referral put

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,900
those that you didn't don't know paid

00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,580
service user usually paid campaigns

00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,650
organic searches usually that comes over

00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,440
Google Bing Yahoo and similar search

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:11,200
engines direct is if somebody actually

00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,970
wrote down directly in the URL your your

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,760
landline it on your page

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:18,940
social is of course Facebook Twitter and

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,810
similar social platforms and this plays

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:25,060
our banners videos YouTube's and other

00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,730
these platforms of advertising and

00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,230
referrals if somebody's put referral on

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:36,580
their website and they're referring to

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:39,460
you most commonly used in blogs and next

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,140
category behavior this one is also

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,370
actually super important if you remember

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,650
that slide with the questions in the

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,510
beginning it's not just important that

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,820
we understand our audience and where

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,930
where they came for but we need to

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,050
understand what they are doing on our

00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:55,660
website so what's the content they are

00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:57,360
consuming is one writer that's running

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,460
on your blog better with the other one

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,830
is one product more interesting to the

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,480
specific segment of your users so these

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,750
are all the questions that you can

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,460
answer to analyzing the behavior you can

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,710
actually see what page is your visitor

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,460
visit whatever is average time on the

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:17,020
page and that's super useful to correct

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,820
whatever mistakes you made on a website

00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,650
to understand it has something it's

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,410
broken and to actually understand what's

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:26,080
interesting to your users I had a recent

00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,210
experience friend of mine asked me to

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,780
check out their eShop it was actually

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,870
performing very poorly beside not having

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,880
the Google Analytics integrated at all

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:39,820
they also put a lot of money in

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,300
marketing thinking that users wanted one

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:46,690
thing it was a pet shop so they kind of

00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:49,060
went all-in cheap delivery everything

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,790
for your pets you don't have to pay for

00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,680
the postage people are really wasn't

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,050
interesting at all in that they were

00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,090
actually interested in specific products

00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,500
and for those specific products you can

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,750
actually find out which one birthday

00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:05,220
once they put that into marketing I

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:08,110
think their sales went up around 300%

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,720
so that's one of things that's Google is

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,150
really shine on it really actually helps

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,010
you to improve your website so one of

00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,770
the things I would mention here you can

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,450
always cite content specific pages typo

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,170
pages you can group them you can filter

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:25,750
them you can analyze your landing pages

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:29,050
the pages but people in most usual land

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,460
when they come to your website one of

00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,140
the things that we talked about is just

00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,270
part sight working properly there's a

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:38,740
site speed very you can actually be

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:40,990
warned site search and one of the key

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,490
things that you need to integrate into

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:46,090
Google and see if you aren't either

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:48,100
event events are not exactly conversions

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,710
so they don't actually bring any value

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,710
but you might want for instance to track

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,210
how many people came to a specific page

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,429
how many people clicked on a specific

00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,500
pop-up how many people applied for a

00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:02,260
newsletter that's 100 key things I would

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,679
actually track how many people

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:07,720
downloaded a specific PDF file all the

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,190
things you can actually track with a

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,950
specific event and there's a lot of

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:16,059
events you can actually customize and

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:18,370
then track with this tool and let's talk

00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:21,070
about conversions so what the

00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,809
conversions most of the people that

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,000
integrate who Alyx forget about this

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,580
step it's that part about measuring

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,790
success measuring if what you are doing

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:33,179
actually in the end comes with something

00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,830
that's useful to your user and to you

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:38,350
did you purchase something they applied

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:40,960
to your program did they download a

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,480
specific video are they interesting what

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,850
you are offering to them and you can set

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,300
up a lot of conversions that are tracked

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,500
by goals you can have a lot of goals of

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:53,380
course for the better analysis you

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,030
really should keep that number small so

00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,790
you set up as a goal let's say a

00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:00,010
purchase on your website and you can set

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:02,770
the purchase bet you can set up as a

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,929
goal number of reps but number of people

00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,000
that apply for a newsletter you can set

00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:08,030
up as a bulb is as a goal visiting a

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,680
specific page

00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,990
why is this super important because in

00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:16,340
the end it's not about having a pretty

00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:18,390
fast sight it's about that sight

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,230
actually delivering what you actually

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:25,230
done with it new users new products

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:28,470
sales contacts working with people and

00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:31,770
you can drag this as a value to you

00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:34,860
through conversions

00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:39,570
once you set them up two things are very

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,190
useful and I recommend you either find

00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,960
on the Internet I'll show you later

00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:48,200
links where you can actually learn more

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,790
about this specific part it's funnel and

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,920
e-commerce e-commerce has its own set up

00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,980
it's a bit more trickier than just

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:59,220
entering goals and the second thing is

00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,870
funnel I think my colleague previously

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,540
talked about the importance of funnel

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:07,140
and how the with each step you have your

00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,730
customers so that's also super important

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,010
here you can actually use it to

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,260
integrate steps in let's your say

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:18,060
checkout process why is this important

00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:20,310
white often Lee people set in a shop

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:23,430
they set up a shopping process order

00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:26,970
process payment process sometime in the

00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:30,570
future something breaks and you're just

00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:33,060
seeing the drop let's say in numbers of

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,220
orders you're not sure why if you have

00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,980
this funnel setup you can actually see

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:42,000
in which step of your process the users

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:45,660
are dropping are they finding it hard to

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,850
work with is there a problem most cases

00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,220
we found out that it's a problem with a

00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,040
browser browser doesn't support some of

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,200
the functionality or stop supporting

00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:59,040
functionality let's say one of the major

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,690
team things in that regard were chrome

00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,810
stopping to support that of the flash

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:06,720
and using its own built-in pledge player

00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,910
a lot of functionality that was tied up

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,860
to Adobe Flash Player simply stopped

00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,690
working and for all the persons that

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,330
were specifically using their websites

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,250
to roam the functionality didn't work

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,530
for those working other browsers didn't

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,710
filter out the double flash they simply

00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,450
continue working so setting up on

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,970
you can see how your customers are

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,429
shorting out you can actually quickly

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:36,350
understand what the problem is with your

00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:38,840
conversion process and this is some of

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,390
the advanced stuff that I wanted to

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,990
mention I'm going to walk through this

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:46,940
quickly and then I'm going to ask you if

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,320
you had any questions because you said

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,820
you're interested mostly in the van

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,950
stuff and I really want to answer your

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,330
questions so at least point you in the

00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,990
right direction that actually actually

00:30:53,330 --> 00:31:00,110
help you the power of views actually

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:02,690
told you about them you can have a lot

00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,850
of views but like I said you need a row

00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,110
one but you can track all the data you

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,330
have the main out where you filter out

00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:10,070
internal traffic bots and other stuff

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,450
that actually interfere with your

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,909
results and you can have additional

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,190
views that's doing you can test new

00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:18,080
filters one of the views that I would

00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,390
recommend every week every each one of

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,830
you to use is mobile view help separate

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,380
view for analyzing the users that are

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,299
coming over mobile you can use the main

00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,850
view to see the difference between

00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:30,740
desktop and mobile users but as we're

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,840
going as we went over the threshold

00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,179
where there is much more mobile users

00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,890
than desktop users it pays out to

00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:43,250
analyze that the mobile users as a

00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:45,169
separate segment then like I said for

00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,490
each of those analysis when you choose

00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,880
the date you can actually choose a

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:52,399
specific segment of users so don't just

00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,020
look at your entire audience look at the

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,580
people who bounced from your website

00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,190
look at the people who purchased

00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,950
something on your website look at the

00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:04,159
male category female category look at

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:06,679
the people who were on your site the

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,350
longest look at the people who at your

00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,510
site the shortest don't just analyze

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,070
everybody try to segment the users the

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,100
more you segment and the more you will

00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:19,820
understand specific audience better

00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,960
again example with the webshop once a

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,419
friend of mine actually had the

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,299
segment's in she understood what

00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:28,460
products are talk one is buying what

00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:31,279
products are cayetana's buying and in

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,250
90% what she thought they needed it's

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,510
not what was sale sold once she

00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,180
understood what each of

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:42,680
customer segments wanted they promoted

00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:45,560
those specific products and again 300 on

00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,440
marketing increase and 200 more on the

00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,640
actual sales

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:55,370
practically they had five times more

00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:58,190
revenue than before you can then analyze

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:00,080
it by behavior by the results and by

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,360
specific sequences you can actually

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,430
track specific users that came over

00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,250
specific paths these specific actions

00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:10,370
websites or bits advanced stuff so I'm

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:12,950
not going to cover it into this one of

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,510
the pretty cool stuff is you can make

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,240
your own custom reports so instead of

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:20,420
going through all of this and this thing

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,820
I'd say 40 minutes of your time more and

00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:26,450
less you can create a report that you

00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,970
will need so not all of this is relevant

00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,420
to you you can maybe just look at the

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,530
views or maybe just the conversions or

00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,230
maybe you're just interested in a

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,360
specific segment or specific location as

00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,980
I've seen today in this world camp most

00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,530
of the people and speakers were here was

00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,930
Lockean so it makes perfect sense for

00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,370
you guys to actually limit your views or

00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:49,430
Google Analytics just to Slovakian

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:53,330
market or we can segment it big cities

00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:55,730
in Slovakia and you can create a special

00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:58,070
report that just deals with the internal

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,800
traffic internal customers and maybe

00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,410
international customers and then create

00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,270
a special report that you can just you

00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:09,530
in one page everything that interests

00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:11,179
you that's also custom dashboard you can

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,250
create the report you don't have to rely

00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:15,919
on these ones you can have custom

00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,290
dashboard one thing that probably will

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,570
be super important and super useful to

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,690
do who are in marketing agencies or who

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,889
provide these reports to their clients

00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,110
you can actually send this custom

00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:28,940
reports to them on a regular basis and

00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:31,389
you can actually give them the access to

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,530
the cars custom dashboard so instead

00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,149
explaining to your clients they need to

00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,389
know everything that we just went

00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:40,399
through you can just show them hey you

00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,159
had this many visitor this month these

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,110
many visitors purchased something from

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,349
this location these are the best best

00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,690
products

00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:51,210
and the process also mostly and the

00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,470
rapport and they understand everything

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,450
perfectly you don't need to waste your

00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,450
time : explaining something is different

00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:03,119
custom alerts are also very useful you

00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:04,859
can actually show you if there is a

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,349
problem with your campaign if you ran

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:08,910
out the budget different some reason the

00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:12,180
number of visitors of conversion has

00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:15,239
dropped suddenly so I would actually as

00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:17,130
one of the advanced stuff I would

00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,989
actually recommend all of you to use

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,539
these customers to alert you let's say

00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:24,059
your website visits have dropped to zero

00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:27,809
hmm probably website is not working and

00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:29,190
then we can go to understanding if you

00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:33,539
can avoid killing of data something

00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:35,999
similar and like I said ecommerce

00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,519
tracking a data this will be super

00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:41,430
useful for all of you that plan of

00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:45,539
releasing an e-commerce shop or do have

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:48,680
an encounter shop does anyone of you use

00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:51,569
e-commerce tracking to Google Analytics

00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,619
okay so some of you actually battle with

00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:57,239
the data layer suppose that is one of

00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,539
the super cool things about Google

00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:02,640
Analytics and one of mostly unknown to

00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:05,519
most people you don't need to rely on

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,349
just the data that's been taken on the

00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,259
website you can actually set additional

00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:12,059
data at Google Analytics so for instance

00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:13,619
somebody purchases some something on

00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:15,839
your website you just you don't need to

00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:17,640
just send him the conversion you can

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,680
actually send him the value the name of

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,930
the product the quantity of the product

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,349
and all of that data is then available

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:27,719
in Google Analytics you can see exactly

00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:31,229
how much you earn to each product and

00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,869
that's also super useful it doesn't for

00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:35,819
if you're running in commercial it makes

00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:38,969
sense not just to know how many items

00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:42,529
you sold but what was actually the

00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:42,529
number that you earned in the end

00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:52,799
so let me just do one slide recap this

00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:55,049
is one slide that's actually put

00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:56,400
everything together so if you want to

00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:58,920
take out something out of this

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,109
presentation both for the beginners for

00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,519
the advanced ones these are the things

00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:07,529
that kind of put everything in one place

00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:09,150
again you will have that presentation on

00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:11,809
my tree trunk art you can download it

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,579
you can save this slide if you need it

00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:16,200
but it shows for each of those category

00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,690
what would be the most important stuff

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,880
that you need to take care of and I

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,829
would recommend everybody from the

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,029
beginners to advanced one that you need

00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:28,440
to have this integrated and this is all

00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:32,130
the things that we can track the Google

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:35,930
Analytics we really cannot track TV

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:39,719
views through analytics at this moment

00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:42,450
so by asking these questions that we

00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:44,849
mentioned in the beginning who is your

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,130
audience where they coming from what are

00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:50,039
they doing on websites and what are the

00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:53,099
results we are actually understanding

00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:56,160
our customers better understanding what

00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,609
they are doing on our website and the

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,140
final and the biggest question do I

00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:06,299
actually see some results that are

00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:08,700
favorable to me as a business and the

00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:10,859
goal is not to look at the stats not to

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:14,190
look at the graphs not to bury yourself

00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:16,259
in a data the goal all of this data or

00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,680
Google Analytics is to improve your

00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:21,089
website and why is that important you

00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,559
have a measurement plan then you can

00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:24,779
track to Google Analytics and other

00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,489
analytics method coolant is not the only

00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:29,999
solution that can help improve your

00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:32,839
website understand your customers like I

00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:39,059
said 90% of the case what we presume is

00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:41,700
not shown to actual results constantly

00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:43,979
improve so constantly upgrade your

00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,710
website your approach your product line

00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:48,299
your content and test everything you can

00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,519
actually test with Google Analytics

00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:52,650
two different versions of web page two

00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:56,369
different versions of a article so you

00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,450
use this tool that's also free to your

00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,760
advantage and then you

00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,650
we'll be set up for success so the goals

00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,960
Google Analytics is not just to look at

00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,730
the charts and numbers but to help every

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,920
and each one of you to understand your

00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,410
audience in your website better to

00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:18,910
improve them and to see something in

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:21,940
return and for the end I prepare the

00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:25,150
feelings if you want to learn more there

00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:27,510
is an analytics Academy everything from

00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,500
the beginning to the more advanced stuff

00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,500
absolutely everything that's currently

00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,180
in the Google Analytics is available

00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,720
through the analytics Academy there are

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,240
courses

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,890
video courses there are scriptures there

00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,839
are lectures everything you need and

00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,970
want to know everything that we touched

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,680
in this presentation a lot more

00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:48,700
information can be found on analytics

00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,470
Academy you can if you prefer you can

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,710
actually just go to youtube and watch

00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:57,280
all these videos videos are pretty

00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:59,619
understandable and if you want some

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,540
advanced stuff some integration between

00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:02,890
Google Analytics and another software if

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,310
you're for instance exporting the data

00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:09,010
to some database or Google Data studio

00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,500
you can actually contact their support

00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,910
and then there is a forum that you can

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,440
actually ask questions about the

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,510
advanced stuff and somebody will

00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,180
probably jump in try to point you to the

00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:22,329
article that has the answer or to answer

00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:25,109
them themselves and these are some of

00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:27,819
the tools that work really well for

00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:30,839
instance if you're using Google

00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:33,280
Analytics it probably makes sense if you

00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:35,859
oftenly use it to have annoyed it except

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,380
on your phone so you can be alerted you

00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:40,930
can check at any time the client calls

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,849
what there is also the website what are

00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:44,410
the main figures what happened how many

00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:46,510
sales did you have how many bits that

00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,180
you have it's super helpful to have it

00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,800
on your phone

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,109
Google tag manager and as a way of

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,750
integrating different analytics and

00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:58,599
conversion tags tag system to actually

00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:01,180
check if your analytics tags are working

00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,960
on your website attribution modeling

00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:08,670
data studio is super cool

00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,890
I cannot go into this because it's a bit

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,810
complicated and it deals much more with

00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,490
a statistics and reporting but you can

00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,950
use all this data from Google Analytics

00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,560
to push into data studio and to create

00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,390
any report that you would like so not

00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,130
limited to views and metrics on this

00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:27,380
solution but you can create your own

00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:31,589
basically and now it's time for

00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:36,859
questions please in Slovakia and English

00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:36,859
any please can you deliver the mic Duda

00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,900
very interesting question well and

00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,300
nothing will happen to the analytics

00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:48,990
what will happen is the website owner

00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,580
are required to announce to their users

00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:53,490
they are being tracked with analytics

00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,680
and to ask them if they accept or not to

00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:58,170
be tracked to Google Analytics which by

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,720
the way was actually mandatory quite a

00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:03,210
while ago but generally the people were

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,940
kind of dodging that part if you have

00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,740
actually looked at the many websites and

00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,180
European Union for last couple of years

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,180
you would probably see a banner that

00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:14,490
says here your track to Google Analytics

00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:17,160
what's now coming with the gdpr is there

00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,589
is a mandatory choice for each user to

00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,810
choose if they want to be and they need

00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:23,820
to be asked it's not enough just to tell

00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:27,119
them you're being tracked you need to

00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,040
offer them a way to opt out you need to

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,330
ask them if they accept and only if they

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,099
accept you can actually track them

00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,930
Google latest so I would say it's much

00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,540
more bigger headache for a website

00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:39,170
owners and analytics the eyes then for

00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,170
the user itself

00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:51,290
okay thank you just took questions the

00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:53,840
first one is I've got KPIs - are you

00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:56,630
using when measuring or in optimizing

00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,410
your website called early and the second

00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,380
question

00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,420
I'm just curious whether you use

00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:05,260
last-click attribution model or some

00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,390
other model and why thank you

00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:10,490
you're most welcome first part first

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:13,940
part is a bit trickier we have 13

00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:17,120
analytics teams that range from 4 to 13

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:20,780
persons and each one is divided for a

00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:23,090
specific product because Google go there

00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:26,740
is a really big company or sin thousand

00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:28,940
employees 7 centers around the world

00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,620
because besides the company and because

00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,500
we're not just tracking the website

00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:36,320
internal portals employees see three

00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:40,010
teams telephone calling we have that

00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:42,890
echidna lattice team for each product so

00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:45,620
the KPIs vary by product and by landing

00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,450
pages and we constantly test almost

00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:50,840
every landing page it will list is a

00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:54,140
test at least in two variants the KPIs

00:43:50,840 --> 00:44:00,200
are of course number of orders people on

00:43:54,140 --> 00:44:03,380
websites value and each type is actually

00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:06,770
trickled back to the page - the second

00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,780
part of your question because based on

00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,460
your question I understand that you

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,790
understand the limitation of Google

00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:15,680
Analytics it's not the perfect solution

00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:18,530
so we use actually two different

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,840
solutions the track not just the last

00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,990
wheel click model but they have their

00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:26,030
own internal system that we can actually

00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:27,860
track the users not just through

00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,960
analytic Google Analytics cookie but

00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,030
throughout all platforms so we kind of

00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,750
integrate we can integrate much more

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:39,080
wide range we can actually track TV we

00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:40,940
can actually track calls we using the

00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,820
next term company because specified

00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,290
software to actually have a multi-touch

00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:51,740
conversion model and each value each

00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:53,990
sale each product each view is actually

00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,509
distributed by algorithm through all

00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:59,809
touch points

00:44:55,509 --> 00:45:01,729
and it really works well much better

00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:09,489
than the simple Google Analytics

00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:09,489
integration edge to my menial tasks

00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:14,930
did you have any question about your

00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,819
Google Analytics or something that you

00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,819
want to see solved for your website

00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:29,940
I is there any plugin which integrate

00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:33,470
Google Analytics into Google tag manager

00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:35,340
through GDP our problem like if it is

00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:38,610
true or false

00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:40,410
from the website like not anything

00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:44,100
that's working properly at this moment

00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:45,630
in that time they are working and almost

00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,270
all the major companies are preparing

00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:50,040
for GDP our but I don't know if anything

00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,390
anybody had actually created the

00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,490
solution put it on the market for

00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,890
everybody else I know they have up

00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:58,440
working versions for themselves I can

00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:00,150
tell you that but not lying not one plug

00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,520
in the moment actually solved the GPR

00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:06,060
for the website owners so you have to

00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,830
approach it manually to look at what GPR

00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,990
actually requires of the website users

00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,970
what you need to inform users what

00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,619
rights do they have on your website and

00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:16,970
have sort of manual solution for that

00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:19,110
ask their consent don't email everybody

00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:22,200
inform them about the rights that they

00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:24,510
can be erased from your system ask their

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,100
consent before sending the best advice

00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,230
then I can actually give every one of

00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,119
you have a double opt-in for email

00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,980
that's way that way you will be covered

00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,670
so everybody that are current till your

00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,710
email list

00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,170
my recommendation is actually send them

00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,970
an email say are you concerned on

00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,910
emailing you on this this and this

00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:43,980
subject and then just continue email

00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,150
them because you have consent and remove

00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:51,929
ones that you don't

00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:51,929
