who has who's never been to the business

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,510
track our business track all right so

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,090
here's how this works a little bit

00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,540
different business track we're gonna

00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:22,680
have four speakers today and this is not

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:26,400
planned Chris didn't prep anything right

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,439
there's no slides I don't know what

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,309
she's going to say we haven't talked

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:37,530
beforehand yeah literally no one and and

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:41,430
so I am here just to get the information

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,440
that you want out of Chris's head and

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,790
that's what this is about for the next

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,370
two hours so there's gonna be four

00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,950
presenters four speakers and we're just

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,899
going to talk and today there's a common

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,399
theme what we're going to talk about

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,530
with all the four speakers is failure

00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,390
and especially business failure and what

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,940
the takeaways were from though from that

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,240
failure and again all we're going to do

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,900
is just chat and so if you have

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,280
questions for Chris this is interactive

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,450
Chris I are gonna chat but if you have

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,600
something specifically that you learn to

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,159
ask Chris let me know and and let's get

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,850
that information out of her head

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,799
you do that good Chris and I have known

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,600
each other for for several years we met

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,790
at WordCamp San Francisco many many

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,729
years ago and this is somebody that I've

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,890
just admired and and respected for for a

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,070
long long time so give a warm welcome

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,670
for Chris for

00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:39,710
[Applause]

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,509
so Chris do you want to start do you

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,979
have any any any stories that you can

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,710
think of or anything you want to tell or

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:47,210
examples of just times in business

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,060
because you've been doing this you've

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,189
been at this a long time so anything

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,880
that you've maybe failed at that you

00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:58,280
want to share that you'd be really human

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,539
I don't leave things

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,929
I graduated from Design School in 1996

00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:09,250
it was coincidentally the same year that

00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:12,410
the commercial internet became a thing I

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,269
started off as a print designer and got

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,360
a job at a skateboard company I was

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:20,660
supposed to be designing t-shirts and

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:24,560
their web guy quit and so guess who was

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,690
their new web girl and so that was kind

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,390
of that where I said where I started my

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:33,230
path I worked at agencies for about 10

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:35,810
years and that was really like one of

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:40,840
the first big not failures on my part

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:43,549
but failures on the.com economy where

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,440
basically a bunch of us had been working

00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:49,220
at this great company we were doing

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,410
projects for like this guy named Steve

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,720
Wynn who was gonna open up a hotel

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,590
called mreb that instead he named after

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,180
himself like it was a big awesome

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,549
Superfund agency working with super

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,139
smart people and we showed up for work

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:08,989
one day and the doors were locked

00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:12,380
oh yeah like so long suckas you're not

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:18,319
getting paid either and so that's how I

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,730
became a freelancer and like I would say

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,010
like that was the first big

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,380
disillusioning failure through no fault

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,190
of my own but just kind of realizing

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:32,930
like sometimes in bubble economies

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,819
things happen and you've got to figure

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,209
out how to bounce back from them and

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:41,239
mine was okay if I can't find a job

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,040
because every com is closing and you can

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,079
pick up an Aeron chair on the street

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,459
from all the dot-coms going out of

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,720
business literally on the street

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,430
literally on the street like

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,140
because I don't know if anyone was

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,420
around at that time but they were like

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,000
hiring people and paying him $100,000 a

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,620
year to sit in a chair and not code just

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,290
so when people came through it looked

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,000
like you had a really big agency and so

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,330
like people were just throwing money

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,940
around foosball tables free soda it was

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,340
awesome when you were 27 like it was the

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,350
best job in the world until he realized

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,240
they'd spent all the money on foosball

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,760
tables and catered lunches and free

00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,170
sodas and you didn't get a paycheck and

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,330
the door was locked when he showed up

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,410
for work so I know you're continuing the

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,300
story I want to share something along

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,490
those lines really quick I was in LA at

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,320
the time so I was in Santa Monica or as

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:34,080
we were located and my buddy Bill Rini

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,670
he he worked at at a large agency like

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,190
it's like you were saying he quit his

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,740
six-figure job to take half of his

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,090
salary and go to work at eToys com he

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,640
was employee number six anybody know

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,610
what eat toys is remember eat ice so e

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,200
toys led that calm failure that was the

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,780
big that was the first one that crashed

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,690
and so everybody around him they were

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,860
millionaires on paper they all bought

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,780
Mercedes or leased Mercedes and

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,030
expensive apartments in Santa Monica

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,610
maybe this exact same experiences you he

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,140
came in one day and the doors were well

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,880
the doors weren't locked but he came in

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,680
one day and literally everybody was

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,080
racing out the door with an Aeron chair

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,729
on their back so that's what made me

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,040
think you that when when you said that I

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:19,229
got my first one gig hard drive it was

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,760
like we were like our when we went back

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,320
in to collect our personal things

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,580
everyone was like this is my personal

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,490
thing that's about how much my paycheck

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:32,490
was yeah awesome

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,470
anyway gone with your story and yeah so

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,010
so like the lesson I learned from that

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,410
is the biggest thing about failure is

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:44,669
learning to be resilient and bounce back

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,010
from it I was really bothered by it like

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:50,729
it really affected me I took it really

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:53,669
personally and it was just an

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,550
opportunity that I didn't know was an

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:02,310
opportunity yet because I went on to

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:03,319
freelance for 13 years under a variety

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,599
and

00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:11,990
you know I decided the last one was

00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:15,199
really really dumb and so it took me to

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:18,979
places I never knew that I could go by

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,629
myself got it all right you know you

00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,999
strike me you've always struck me as

00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:27,889
somebody who's got moxie

00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:29,539
grits gumption you pick a word right and

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,669
but that's what it that I think that

00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,599
that it takes some of that to go through

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,749
what you went through

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,569
right and bounced back yeah yeah I mean

00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:43,759
you just have to there's this does

00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:48,080
everyone know who brené Brown is I would

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,010
join that woman's cult that's when I

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,550
came up with I would join that woman's

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,019
[Laughter]

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,019
for those who don't know tell us she is

00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:59,180
a shame and vulnerability researcher

00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:02,389
which sounds like a really horrible

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,729
thing to read books about but she wrote

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,159
this book called rising strong and it's

00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:12,349
all about people who were resilient

00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:16,209
versus people who aren't and I mean I've

00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:18,829
been knocked down so many times that

00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:22,759
that sometimes I wonder how I kept

00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:26,539
getting back up sure and it's just

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,999
what's what's the alternate my dad and

00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:31,879
my mom were divorced when I was about 16

00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:34,099
years old and to the end of his life he

00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,349
was still bitter about it and angry

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,959
about it and kind of never got over what

00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:41,529
happened and it just kind of struck me

00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,029
like I don't want to live my life as

00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:46,159
someone who takes this one thing that

00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,800
happened to him 20 years ago or 10 years

00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:50,779
ago or five years ago and lets it

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,089
control their life like that's not the

00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:55,699
person I want to be and so I think

00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:58,219
cultivating you know reading about how

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,229
to be more resilient and bounce back

00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:02,629
from those things like that's the

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,829
biggest lesson of failure is no matter

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:06,139
how many times you get kicked in the

00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:08,389
teeth get back up you know the only

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,579
other option is to lay down and you

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,569
don't get anywhere when you do that and

00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:13,339
I think something else we have in common

00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:15,710
because my parents were divorced at five

00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:17,980
right I think

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,890
the people that I know that came from

00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,230
divorced parents have a certain

00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:27,230
independence right they are able to kind

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,090
of figure things out on their own you

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,580
know be on their own be comfortable on

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,230
their own because it's part of a part of

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,870
your upbringing I feel like you have

00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,610
that that same yeah well and I was 16

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,560
and my parents were both like woohoo

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,720
they got married when they were like 17

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,640
18 years old so they went off to live

00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,580
their life so I just kind of went feral

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,340
at 16 which you know it's not a really

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,190
good time for a kid to be without

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,980
supervision I have no idea what you

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,110
talking about

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,180
and so it was you're you're absolutely

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,570
right like you have to learn to figure

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,820
things out on my 18th birthday my dad

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,030
was like here's the one adds find

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,740
yourself an apartment and so it was it

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,020
was like just kind of like I have to

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,460
figure it out because there's no real

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:18,440
safety net there like there is no there

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,870
is no lay down because there's really no

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:25,820
one to come up behind you and pick you

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:28,190
up got it all right I'm gonna keep going

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:33,100
unless anybody's got yes Sam has a

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,100
question for Chris I Sam

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,850
so I'm gonna I'm just gonna repeat kind

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,000
of repeat the question for the for the

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,320
for the for the video right so that I'm

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,520
gonna paraphrase because it was really

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,470
well-spoken and I'm not gonna be that

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:24,510
well-spoken but what do you do right

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,010
once once once you've experienced that

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,110
failure or you've been knocked down

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,330
right what do you what do you do in the

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,780
short term to pick yourself back up well

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:37,230
like the first week I cry and beat

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:41,760
myself up and tell myself how terrible I

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:44,490
am and I'm not gonna lie like yeah I

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,530
spend a good solid week but what I do is

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,530
I set a timeline I'm like okay your pity

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,990
party ends on Friday you can go ahead

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,540
and feel all these feelings for this

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,640
week or day or depending on like the

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:01,980
magnitude of the failure how long I've

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:04,080
allowed myself and then I try to do I

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,490
don't know if everyone here knows I'm

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,020
pretty open about it but about seven

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,660
years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,390
disorder which got me into therapy which

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,000
was awesome and so I give myself that

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,290
time and then I get back into doing

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,750
healthy things for myself

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,760
I don't wallow I get back on a schedule

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,740
even if I don't feel like it I forced

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,690
myself to get out of bed I forced myself

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,120
to take a shower and get dressed I

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,730
forced myself to restart for an a brown

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,500
book so that I can start like putting

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,450
those positive words she has this thing

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,530
where she's talking about shame and

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:40,860
there's a difference between shame and

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:43,710
and I can't remember what the other one

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,390
is off the top of my head but shame is

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,090
telling yourself that you're a bad

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:51,779
person and you're not a bad person

00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:54,410
something bad happen to you and so the

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:58,740
are the kind of things like I rely on

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:03,149
books and being around people who remind

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,829
me that no you don't suck and and having

00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,290
a good support system like having people

00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:10,949
around you who you trust to tell you

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:13,410
when maybe you know you did something

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:15,509
wrong to cause the failure and the

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,860
lessons you can learn from it so that

00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,550
you know that they're not blowing smoke

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,199
when they're telling you that no this

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,610
you're not worthless

00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:26,269
you know you here's how great you are

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,949
here are the things you accomplished and

00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:32,009
here are here are the things that you

00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:35,389
can do with that now it's interesting

00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:39,600
because you took me a long time to

00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:42,149
embrace therapy as well right you know

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,629
up until probably 40 yeah I thought okay

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,339
therapy's for losers right our swiss we

00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:50,189
don't share your dirty laundry with

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:52,350
other people right like it's just it was

00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:54,209
part of my belief system until I started

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,649
actually going right and it does help

00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:56,970
one of the things that might say wait

00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,410
you said something interesting right you

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,240
said it's not it's you know it's not

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,129
that's um you're a bad person something

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,139
bad happened to you you might take that

00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:06,180
even a step further and say something

00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,829
happened to you right without putting a

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,740
label of good or bad on it right this

00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:12,300
just this thing happened yeah right and

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,860
it's another way of just relabeling and

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,569
say okay now I'm gonna move on to the

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:27,089
next thing so I thought it's under their

00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:29,309
hand okay um one of the other things

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,540
that you said you know because you've

00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:34,110
been doing this leave that this a long

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:36,029
time right and you've been under many

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,309
different labels you know you've had to

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,480
reinvent yourself right so let's talk

00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:45,660
about that a little bit what does that

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:48,149
process look like for you um so I've had

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,240
my skillset become obsolete during my

00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:55,709
career probably five times huh you know

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:59,399
like I quoted HTML I started as a print

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:01,139
designer that was my education and then

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,970
I fell in love with the web because one

00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,720
of my professors was moving on to work

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,250
at Wired magazine and he really

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,639
encouraged me to get into it he thought

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,430
I'd enjoy it and so I started you know

00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:15,069
doing HTML with tables and spacer gifts

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,019
and frame sets and all of that and then

00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:20,709
flash came along and that's what

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:23,620
everyone did is awesome you know what I

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:26,500
was actually looking at a flash archive

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,449
like the history of the web I miss like

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,240
I don't miss the inaccessibility and

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:33,939
stuff of flash but it was so fun oh like

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,339
as like being able it was almost like

00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,060
being in video and not the web yeah

00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,920
really

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,689
like I enjoyed that was one of my

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,420
favorite parts of my career was doing

00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:45,790
that because it was so creative and then

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,110
flash died and I went back into print

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,560
for a while I was a professional

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,959
scrapbooker for several years I art

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,079
directed a series of crafting books I

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,329
was the first openly gay scrapbooker

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:04,089
which caused a lot of kerfuffle back in

00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:06,269
like a lot of people weren't too happy

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,680
about that at one point a magazine

00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,240
accepted one of my submissions and

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,980
called me back and said we actually

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,529
can't use it the editors said that they

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,240
can't put this in the magazine because

00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:19,360
it's a picture of you and your wife

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,279
being affectionate and we think that our

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,860
audience would really be upset about

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,800
that and the last thing I ever had

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,379
published in a magazine was in a June

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,230
wedding issue of our marriage in Canada

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:35,339
when it became legal so it was kind of

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,629
one of those things where you know I

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,399
kind of broke down some barriers in

00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:42,309
there and that was a really interesting

00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:46,660
learning experience it didn't end well

00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:50,309
but it was an interesting career we can

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,309
talk about that one later it's probably

00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:58,629
so in each of these during each of these

00:15:55,569 --> 00:16:00,129
transitions was it was it conscious did

00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:01,959
you make a constitution this is what I'm

00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,160
gonna do did you try but you'd throw a

00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,439
bunch of stuff at the wall and see

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,660
what's stuck but how did it work for you

00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:10,389
I was always kind of like looking ahead

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,880
like when I saw flash coming out I made

00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:14,860
it a point to learn it because I I just

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,449
had a gut feeling it was gonna be a big

00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,620
thing so I've always just kind of looked

00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:20,350
it like I get

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,120
bored really easily and so when I do

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,350
something for a certain period of time

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,720
and it becomes routine I start looking

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,370
around for something else to do

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
so either looking ahead to what new

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,460
technologies are coming out or I'm

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,750
really bored and how do I not be bored

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,640
and then some things have just been

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,610
random opportunities like that whole

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,130
scrap booking thing I had gone to a

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,810
craft conference to go look at paper and

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,270
hang out with one of my friends who was

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,950
in the industry I met some random guy

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,900
and we started talking about the

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,240
difference between Charles Anderson and

00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,850
Charles T Anderson which if you're not a

00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,500
designer he would not know about but it

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,800
was a very spirited like hour-long

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,819
conversation and a week later I left my

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,429
job making Rain Bird timer demos and

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:12,220
flash which was hellaciously boring rain

00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:15,429
rain bird like Whistler okay I would

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,110
like draw 3d things and like animate

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:22,720
them in flash to show you how to program

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:24,520
your spray okay for years Wow and so it

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,179
was just this random opportunity like

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,240
hey how would she like to our designer

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:34,840
of this series of books is leaving would

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:38,200
you like to art direct him and so it was

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,020
just like yeah I'd like to do that and

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,390
it was actually at this time where we

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,100
were transitioning to CSS and I wasn't

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,900
really comfortable with it and this

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,309
opportunity came along so it was like

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,740
okay I don't have to learn that I know

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:54,760
print and it sounds interesting so I

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,460
just randomly picked a path so yesterday

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,700
you were giving a discussion of about

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:02,950
project management process right you

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,600
find that of all these things that

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,429
you've done you've carried certain

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,070
skills with you through all of them Oh

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:11,350
totally I was saying in the thing

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,670
yesterday that my project management

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,900
philosophy is I want to be the project

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:21,670
manager that I wish I had when I was a

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:23,740
designer or working for brands or and a

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,909
lot of what I've learned just working at

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,340
agencies

00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:32,019
and working as a freelancer with clients

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:35,139
doing project management and a lot of

00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:38,169
the UX and UI skills I learned and like

00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:41,559
iterative thinking and all of that

00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:43,779
design thinking that that everyone talks

00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,849
about like I totally informed I'm

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:48,609
designing experiences for our clients

00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:50,529
right now and so everything I do I think

00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,779
about through the lens of my user

00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,460
experience brain or it's like how can I

00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,919
improve this experience how can I

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,659
iterate on it to make it better and so I

00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,340
do that for both our clients and our

00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:04,749
internal team like they have a user

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:06,940
experience on him too so everything has

00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:08,909
definitely like in addition to the

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,499
failures but just like the hard skills

00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:14,259
I've learned over the course of the

00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:21,429
years have informed every new position

00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:24,249
I've taken cool of questions you're

00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:26,830
nailing it they've absolutely no

00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:28,239
questions for you so of all the client

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,259
experiences that you've had all the

00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,940
clients that you dealt with over the

00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:32,559
since 1996

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,090
right all those interactions with

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,129
internal clients and external clients

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,619
everything has always got 100 percent

00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:42,999
perfect yeah totally great I'm awesome

00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:45,039
questions for Chris yeah tell me yeah

00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,609
actually no I was kidding give me one

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,159
second

00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:53,200
give me give me one second Mike so tell

00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:55,059
me about a project that that you can

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,379
remember because I know there's the one

00:19:55,059 --> 00:20:00,369
right that just completely blew up

00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:00,879
whether it was in your controller out of

00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:06,809
your control

00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:06,809
oh god so you don't have to name names

00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:12,549
that's weird I can think about like off

00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:14,619
the top of my head I'm thinking about

00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,659
terrible clients he would scream at me

00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:23,379
you know terrible clients who wouldn't

00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:27,369
pay me and I'm like oh I thought I was

00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:30,009
working on one project with a horrible

00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:32,320
project management system I did not know

00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:35,980
what I was doing yet like it was all

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,830
spreadsheets and Google Docs and

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,500
add binders with my information in it

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,120
that's like that bad yeah and and it was

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,830
beyond like there were project

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:50,019
management tools I didn't have to have

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:53,200
binders with printouts and everything

00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:57,190
went wrong like bad client communication

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,080
and we would scream at each other on the

00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,899
phone like he would literally call you

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,630
the client the client would call me up

00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:06,340
and just like verbally abuse me and

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,169
apparently he did it to his employees

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,639
too and and none of us really talked

00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:13,630
about it but just not a very nice guy

00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:19,029
and it was just the most horrible

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:21,519
experience miss deadlines there was

00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:24,549
another project I worked on one time at

00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,460
an agency that through no fault of our

00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:30,130
own didn't launch for three years I only

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,840
a year for a year Wow yeah I worked

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,090
there for a year I did all the design

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,529
and like every six months I'd check in

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,409
I'm like I wonder if that thing's gone

00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:40,419
live yet and three years later the same

00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,730
design which was totally outdated and

00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:44,320
finally went up I was like I'm so glad I

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,630
didn't stay and work on that for three

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,519
years wow that's some good I think

00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,690
that's like the longest one that ever

00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:52,450
ever

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,179
that's some serious slippage Mike my

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,039
question for you so over over the years

00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:00,240
as you've been working for agencies but

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,010
also working freelance by yourself as

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,760
you're changing your skillset and

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,039
changing things around

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,639
do you find that when you're working as

00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,549
a freelancer that you know the freedom

00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:15,820
that comes with that and the flexibility

00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:18,100
versus the stability of working with an

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,899
agency do you kind of go back and forth

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,340
between those if like oh yeah I kind of

00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:23,409
missed that flexibility and start to

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,090
lean more when way or the other like

00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:27,220
what are you well you feel about that

00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,889
and as a follow-up is their stability

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,990
working for an agency there is

00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:36,780
definitely more stability working for an

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:38,429
agency I health insurance is awesome

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,440
[Laughter]

00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:45,070
vacations that someone like pays you for

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,159
are awesome I'm really really fortunate

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,870
about four years ago I think it was that

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,520
long my friend

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:55,780
called me up and he said I want to talk

00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,920
to you about something don't hang up the

00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:02,620
phone always a great way to start all

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,670
hard conversations to please don't hang

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:08,320
up on me and I was like okay and he said

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,270
an opportunity has come up

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,040
it is totally not what you do but I

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,780
think you'd be really good at it would

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,480
you like to come and be a project

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,700
manager at crowd favorite and so I said

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,260
yeah you know I had kind of gotten to a

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,750
point where I felt like I had gone as

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,760
far as I could as a freelancer like

00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,500
there was kind of a cap on the projects

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,660
I could take unless I wanted to become

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:35,230
my own agency

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:37,120
I am very not like I'm not really good

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,980
at forcing myself to do things I'm the

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,990
person who has a freelancer he's like

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,360
let's go to Target this afternoon that

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,770
sounds fun and then I stay up till 4

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,690
o'clock in the morning catching up on

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,820
work so I was really burned out on just

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,190
the constant grind and so I was like

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,250
yeah sure that sounds like fun if it you

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,650
know isn't a fit it isn't a fit so I

00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:00,640
went and got a crash course in project

00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:03,160
management and after about a year I was

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,690
like oh I don't know man freelance like

00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,410
maybe I should give it one more shot

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:12,310
like I was I was having this crisis

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:15,100
where I being a designer I felt like

00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:17,620
wasn't my job it was really a core part

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,560
of who I am like that was a really

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,680
important part of me that's how I

00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:25,920
self-identified and so I was like I I'm

00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,250
not sure if I'm ready to give that up

00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,680
entirely like I feel like maybe I should

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:37,200
give it another shot and see if it's

00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:40,960
gonna work out and it didn't and I was

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,480
doing support for a tool called design

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,500
palette Pro I had started my WordPress

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,450
career off building Genesis themes while

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,220
it was studio first it was revolution

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,700
and then it was studio press and then

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:58,330
Genesis came out so I did the earliest

00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:01,580
kind of female focused theme there and

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,200
so there was an opportunity to do some

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,090
poured it with some steady work which

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,630
was nice it filled in the freelance gaps

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:11,210
and then the two partners Josh and

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:16,900
Andrew Norcross Josh Eaton and Andrew

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,900
Norcross lemma Stoll Norcross away and

00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:25,280
no he gave Andrew a great opportunity

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,450
and he's super happy Barry let's go I

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,930
like the way you described at the firm

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,480
hand they needed a project manager

00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,880
because they were starting to grow and I

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,240
had randomly made a comment and slack

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,850
about project management earlier in the

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,250
day like no idea why it was just like

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,960
well have you tried this tool and Josh

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,460
was like oh hey you actually have a

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,190
background in this would you be

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,660
interested in coming on and because it's

00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:57,230
a fully distributed company I am one of

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,300
the very very fortunate people who has a

00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:01,700
full-time job with a great team

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,130
everyone's worked there like we've had

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,630
no one leave in the two years I've been

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:09,050
there so it's a really tight cohesive

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:12,980
team we all love working together like

00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:15,020
everyone there is great and and so if

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,360
you can find something like that like I

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,730
find that when I'm accountable to people

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,670
other than myself I'm much more

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,980
disciplined like it's much it's much

00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,870
harder for me to blow something off when

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,300
someone else is waiting on it I don't

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,910
like disappointing people so it's great

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,660
for me like it's a good structure for me

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:40,940
to stay disciplined and get things done

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:42,560
and but it's really like what works for

00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,660
you I personally I could never

00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,390
communicate like the idea of having to

00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,910
get in a car and spend 45 minutes going

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:55,160
someplace to talk to people on slack all

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:56,660
day I just I can't do it yeah well I

00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,520
think we'll end there thank you very

00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,100
much big round of applause for Chris for

00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,450
it's everyone

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,450
