ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,630
to see - Natalie mclees

00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:21,980
good morning um all right so we're gonna

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,360
get started with a pop quiz just so I

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,669
can make sure that you're all awake and

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,810
ready true or false

00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:33,579
accessibility means making the web

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,579
usable for people with disabilities

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,570
raise your hand if you think it's true

00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:45,110
raise your hand if you think it's false

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:51,700
why is it false well for everybody

00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:55,520
anyone else no other reasons for false

00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:59,270
all right I think this is false and

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,350
we're gonna talk about why and the first

00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,250
thing that we're gonna get started with

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:07,340
is people with disabilities who are

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,930
these people with disabilities that need

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,270
to use our websites and the products

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,819
that we build and we're actually gonna

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:19,880
get started by talking about disability

00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:22,609
so each one of us has a unique capacity

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,460
both a physical capacity and a mental

00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:27,979
capacity and that's unique to everybody

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:33,109
and it's important to note that capacity

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:36,590
is a spectrum if we look at physical

00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:39,100
capacity on one end of the spectrum we

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,079
would have somebody who had no mobility

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,209
so someone like the author of the bell

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,740
jar and the butterfly right who wrote an

00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:48,579
entire book by blinking his right eye

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,100
because that was all he could move and

00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:54,020
at the other end of the spectrum he you

00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,880
might be thinking oh Mimi I'm at the

00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,560
opposite end of the spectrum but no I

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,409
would say you're not because can you do

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,009
this if you say yes I'm gonna make you

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,009
come up and do it

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,629
or this or this

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,989
this is Roger Bannister running the

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:15,330
four-minute mile right so the actual

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:18,870
opposite end of the spectrum from no

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,730
mobility is elite athletes whose bodies

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,660
are capable of doing things that most of

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,900
the rest of us

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,180
can't do and most of the rest of us find

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,370
ourselves quite happily here in the

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:36,840
middle of the bell curve for both

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:39,870
physical and mental capacity and what we

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,970
have done as a society is we have kind

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,989
of just arbitrarily decided to draw a

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,430
line somewhere on this spectrum and

00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:49,500
we've decided well if you're to the left

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,420
of that line you're a person with a

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,390
disability but it's important to know

00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,870
that that is just a societal societal

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,260
decision based on what we value as a

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,120
society it's got no basis in medical

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,489
information no basis in scientific

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,859
information it's completely arbitrary

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:17,730
and that line could just as easily have

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:19,799
been drawn here or even here we have

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,889
several different kinds of disabilities

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,040
as well so we have permanent

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,889
disabilities once you have this kind of

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,910
disability you're stuck with it for the

00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,450
rest of your life

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,430
and these include some really common

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,579
things that we don't always think about

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,690
as a disability so I'm looking out in

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:42,180
the room and I see lots of people

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,000
wearing glasses and probably even more

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,919
are wearing contact lenses that's a

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,400
visual impairment that's a visual

00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:53,760
disability for which you use assistive

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,630
technology of glasses or contacts to

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,250
extend the natural capacity of your body

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:03,030
we also have lots of other really common

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,669
conditions like color blindness hearing

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,500
impairment okay I myself am actually

00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,030
almost completely deaf in my right ear

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,790
so that's another really common one

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,750
things like arthritis back pain that we

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,049
all have

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,209
migraine headaches I also have bad news

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:28,260
for you every day when you wake up

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:30,240
you're a day older and probably if you

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:35,400
haven't developed a lot of disabilities

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,700
yet you probably will most of us do and

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,980
we also have temporary disabilities and

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,550
these are usually injuries and illness

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:48,360
so who break your ankle or sprain your

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,340
wrist right that impedes your physical

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,190
capacity for a period of time until it

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,520
heals and gets better and we also have

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,560
things like it could be illnesses as

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,450
serious as things like cancer that might

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,600
impede both physical and mental capacity

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,550
for weeks months or even years or it

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,740
could be something as simple as a bad

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,330
head cold because if you sat on your

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,000
computer and tried to solve a difficult

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,350
design problem or coding problem on cold

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,830
medicine when you can't breathe right

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,980
there's definitely a little less mental

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,500
capacity than normal it's definitely

00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,260
challenging another temporary one

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,780
insomnia like trying to we all have

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,580
times when we can't sleep for hopefully

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,010
not more than a few nights in a row but

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,780
there's definitely mental capacity is

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,500
diminished after a few nights of not

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,550
having any sleep and then we also have

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,350
situational disabilities and these are

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,020
things that we kind of move in and out

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,200
of all day long that we don't even think

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,380
about if you think about how having to

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,810
carry a big heavy box how that impacts

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,580
your mobile capacity rate you're gonna

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,720
get tired faster you're not gonna be

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,100
able to move as fast and getting like

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,560
being rid of that is as simple as

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,330
setting down the box but it's still a

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,600
situation that you have to navigate at

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,970
the time if the Sun comes out at lunch

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,220
and we're out at the food trucks and you

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,470
try to use your phone at lunch right

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,720
there will be very little contrast on

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,790
your screen it'll be hard to see things

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,890
so that's a situational visual

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,430
impairment right that's going to make it

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,670
difficult to look at a screen under

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,590
bright sunlight if you try to share your

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,600
favorite YouTube video with your friend

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,100
tonight at the after-party right they're

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,690
not going to be able to hear it and

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,650
allowed crowded room so we have a

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,470
situational hearing impairment and then

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,690
another one you could think about

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,520
holding a feverish screaming baby in one

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,080
hand while trying to dust really find

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,480
the phone number for the doctor with the

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,670
other right so not only do you have

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,770
physical capacity diminished by your

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,480
hands both being occupied but there's

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,400
also the mental capacity being

00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,960
diminished by stress and worry and

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:05,560
probably a lack of sleep so who are

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:09,220
these people with disabilities they're

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,040
every single one of us so our statement

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:16,600
now becomes accessibility means making

00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,280
the web usable for everyone I still

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,230
don't really like this though I think

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:26,110
there's still a problem but let's talk

00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:29,230
about accessibility and I'm going to go

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:32,860
through a series of statements that I

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:36,370
have had colleagues co-workers clients

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:39,640
bosses make to me about accessibility

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,180
over the past several years of working

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:46,780
in the web industry the first thing that

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,770
I've heard is accessibility is an act of

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:53,820
charity for marginalised edge cases

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,820
something we do because we're nice

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:59,820
accessibility is a business decision

00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,820
there must be a return on investment

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,200
only developers have to think about

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,850
accessibility because it's all about how

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:14,410
things get coded accessible websites are

00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:18,270
boring and ugly making a website

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,270
accessible is expensive and difficult

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,910
accessibility requirements stifle

00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,860
innovation and accessibility isn't that

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:30,790
important because it doesn't impact very

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,340
many people so those are all things that

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:37,900
people have said to me outright so

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:40,729
clearly accessibility has a PR problem

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,380
there's a lot of baggage a lot of

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,200
misunderstandings a lot of

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,130
misconceptions about accessibility we

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,890
could try to reclaim the term and make

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,450
people realize what it actually is but

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,300
I'm actually in the camp that it's

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,710
actually just time to rebrand this isn't

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,470
just me there's lots of people across

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,790
the internet calling for this and if

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,590
there's one thing that working in the

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,900
web for 20 years has taught me is that

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:09,200
if you want something to catch on give

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:12,130
it a good name right Ajax responsive

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:20,720
design so let's start calling it

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:22,910
inclusive design and let's look at those

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,210
myths reframed as statements about

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,590
inclusive design so instead of

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,200
accessibility is an act of charity for

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:34,000
marginalised edge cases we have

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,870
inclusive design is a civil right that

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,730
means equal access for all

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,420
instead of accessibility is a business

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,510
decision

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:48,190
we have inclusive design is an

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:51,380
investment that always returns dividends

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:55,130
instead of only developers have to think

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,500
about accessibility everyone needs to

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:02,990
think about inclusive design and I do

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:05,830
mean everyone content UX marketing

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:08,750
project managers designers developers

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:13,640
everyone needs to think about inclusive

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:16,880
design instead of accessible websites or

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:21,890
boring and ugly inclusive design is both

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,870
beautiful and usable and instead of this

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,470
idea that making a website accessible is

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:31,220
difficult and expensive inclusive design

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,080
is just built into your process it is

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,670
true that if you go back to a project

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,830
that was built with without

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,730
accessibility in mind and try to make it

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,740
accessible it can be challenging and

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,600
expensive it could cost us up to as much

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,180
as it cost to build the website in the

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,010
first place but when you do it from the

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,490
very beginning the increase

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:55,980
in effort is really minimal so we have

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,720
three levels of accessibility a double-a

00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,980
triple-a with a kind of being the bare

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
minimum you can do to call something

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,260
accessible and triple-a being the most

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,780
inclusive with a level I would say

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,330
there's actually no increase in effort

00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:11,460
and with triple-a even triple-a the most

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,650
challenging one to get to you're looking

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,740
at maybe only 15 to 20 percent extra

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:20,190
effort when you do it from the very

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,070
beginning instead of accessibility

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,620
requirements stifle innovation we have

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:29,880
inclusive design encourages innovation

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,710
without barriers and instead of

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,630
accessibility isn't that important

00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,850
because it doesn't empower many people

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:39,240
we have inclusive design benefits

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,220
everyone some other benefits of an

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,890
inclusively designed website include

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,650
better usability faster page download

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:49,760
times better cross browser compatibility

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:52,170
easier content management and better SEO

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:58,050
does anybody not want those things on

00:11:52,170 --> 00:12:00,540
your site alright so going back to our

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,910
statement instead of accessibility needs

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,070
making the web usable for everyone they

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:09,830
have inclusive design it's making the

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,870
web usable for everyone we all on board

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:15,860
yes

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:22,600
so how are we doing how are we doing at

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:27,410
making the web inclusive not very well

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:30,040
not very well at all let me share with

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,820
you the results of a couple of reports

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:37,520
April 2nd so just a few weeks ago a

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:40,340
reach research firm named ovum released

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:44,690
their results of reviewing the websites

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:48,280
of the Fortune 100 nowhere in that

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:52,010
report does it say how many of the 100

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,870
had accessibility issues I even gave

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,660
over my personal information to download

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:59,060
the complete white paper it just doesn't

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,950
say anywhere but reading between the

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,580
lines of the report I'm gonna go ahead

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,860
and guess it was all 100 because they

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,810
found eight hundred and fifteen thousand

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,080
six hundred accessibility issues on

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:15,950
those 100 websites so an average of over

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,560
eight thousand issues per site now you

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,200
might be thinking all right but that's

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,210
the Fortune 100 there's red tape there's

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,280
bureaucracy I'm just a little

00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,460
independent WordPress developer or

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,980
designer I don't build that kind of site

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:34,610
okay then let's talk about the web eight

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:38,300
million this report came out February

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,860
27th of this year web aim is a nonprofit

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,840
organization focused on web

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,020
accessibility it stands for web

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,030
accessibility in mind they reviewed the

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:50,900
top 1 million home pages across the

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:54,110
internet and a million web pages is a

00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,420
lot you can go to the page of the report

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,630
and do a domain search to see if sites

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,920
that you know and work on are in there

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,990
several sites that I have worked on are

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,910
in there so if you've worked on a

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:09,370
project that gets any kind of traffic at

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:11,980
all it's probably in this report and

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,660
what did they find

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:19,760
ninety seven point eight percent of them

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,760
had accessibility issues so here's the

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,060
thing

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,820
if I'm if I'm up against a deadline and

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:32,440
I make a decision one day I just need to

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:34,690
get this done right and I make the bad

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,519
decision to make something be done

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,230
faster instead of billing it the right

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:45,010
way that's just me having a bad day even

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:47,500
if I do that consistently right and I

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,050
put out an accessible website after an

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:54,190
accessible website that's just one bad

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,870
developer but here's the thing ninety

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,089
seven point eight percent of the top

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:03,459
million home pages having accessibility

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:06,639
problems it's not just me and it's not

00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:09,630
just some of us on some days it's all of

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,630
us all of the time

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,670
after the web a million report came out

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,550
there were lots of really good articles

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,519
published by people all across the web

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:25,139
industry and here's a quote from Winston

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,089
Hearns article called perpetuating harm

00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,860
all of us who build the web collectively

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:31,449
decided that we could ignore some

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:37,810
people's needs so the work could be done

00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:41,139
faster I've done this I've done it I'm

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:45,250
sure lots of you have too but we have to

00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:48,100
think about what we're doing because our

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,740
lives are digital now we depend on the

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,510
internet for everything we use it for

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,089
keeping in touch with friends and family

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,339
we use it for getting our news for doing

00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,790
our grocery shopping for having food

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,949
delivered we use it for banking we use

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:06,370
it for learning we can do whole degree

00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:08,110
programs completely online we buy all

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,149
kinds of things for ourselves for our

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,670
homes for our family and friends please

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,829
if her work communications for time

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,290
tracking or interacting with our

00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:19,269
government for sending messages to your

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:23,529
representatives and getting information

00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:29,170
that we need to vote and we are leaving

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:32,920
people behind another quote from Winston

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,000
Hearns article the web industry has

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,130
collectively ex

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,140
sighs its power to state that disabled

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:44,170
people do not belong here I don't think

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,320
that for one minute anybody in this room

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,720
ever said I don't care if people with

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,460
mobility issues can use this like I

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,140
don't think anyone made that decision or

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,470
anybody ever said I don't care blind

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:59,380
people can fill out this form but it

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,900
doesn't really matter what your original

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:05,500
intention was because the message that

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:09,790
we're broadcasting is you don't matter

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:13,540
you're not important and I think we have

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:15,550
to change that we have to step back from

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,579
the individual websites and products

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,819
that we're building to ask ourselves

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:23,500
what kind of world are we building

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,750
because what we're seeing is the

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,870
Internet have so much promise to be so

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,910
inclusive and so accessible to everyone

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,980
but we're slowly building into it all

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:38,500
the same barriers and biases that we

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,970
have in our physical world we're also so

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,130
proud to be part of the WordPress

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,860
community and know that WordPress is one

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,870
third of the Internet but I think with

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,660
that kind of power comes a lot of

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:52,270
responsibility to pay attention to

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:56,010
everyone and to lead the way and set an

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,010
example for the rest of the web industry

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:03,820
in addition if you're somebody who is

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,160
really passionate about social justice

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,560
and civil rights and you participate in

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,680
marches and hold up signs and contact

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,540
your congressperson and do door-to-door

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,670
canvassing and participate in social

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,840
media campaigns and you believe in

00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:21,370
equality for all and equal access

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,150
inclusive design is something that you

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:28,210
can do in your job every single day to

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:31,780
increase the amount of access equity and

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,760
justice in our society like this is a

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,520
way that you can contribute just doing

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:41,380
your job every single day to making the

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:44,110
world a better place in addition we also

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,150
have in addition to the responsibility

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,840
to the end users who use the products

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,940
and websites that we build

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,150
we've got a responsibility to our

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,190
clients have you thought about what

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,510
you're gonna say to your client a year

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,430
or two from now when they come back to

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,230
and say hey you know this website you

00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:05,030
built for us we're being sued because

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:07,520
people can't use it there were 700 web

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:10,280
accessibility lawsuits filed in 2017

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,070
there were twenty two hundred and twenty

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,800
eighteen and there will be even more in

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,100
2019 the people that we're leaving

00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:22,970
behind are fed up they're not gonna put

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:25,340
up with us anymore so we have to start

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,900
doing things the right way right you

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,290
might have heard about the lawsuits

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,570
against Tonka Donuts Target Beyonce

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,940
Domino's those were all big ones in the

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,740
news but the ones that don't get a lot

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,360
of national coverage are the

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,990
family-owned winery in upstate New York

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,240
or the solopreneur in Florida who opened

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,770
a little online shoe store and found

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,340
themselves getting sued because people

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:51,500
couldn't use their websites it's

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,580
starting to happen to lots of businesses

00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:59,210
of all different sizes including single

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:02,150
single owned enterprises and a quote

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,890
from Eric Meili many business owners

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,360
would be livid to find out that the

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,100
technology choices their teams are

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,330
making are actively encouraging the

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:14,540
gullibility but make sure that you are

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,430
informing your clients about their legal

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,710
responsibilities to have an accessible

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,780
website make sure they understand the

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,210
consequences of deciding against that

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,190
and if they absolutely won't sign on to

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,650
it you need to have them sign something

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:34,160
that you're not responsible if anything

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:37,820
happens so where do we go from here how

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:41,410
do we make things better I've got a few

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:44,240
tips that all of us can work on together

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,160
the first one is to start thinking about

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,430
websites in terms of what they ask of

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,620
people does someone really need to

00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:55,100
download and execute a Meg of JavaScript

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,570
to fill out a form with ten fields just

00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,460
make sure that what you're asking of

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,730
people is commensurate with what the

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:04,460
experiences that you're providing

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:08,360
and number two commit to learning about

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,130
inclusive design there's very little

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,769
about it that's particularly difficult

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:16,549
or challenging but there's a lot to know

00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:18,169
and it's easy to feel overwhelmed but

00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:22,720
just commit to learning something about

00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:22,720
it like learn how to do one thing better

00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:29,360
Ethan Marcotte who coined the term

00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:31,070
responsive design wrote in his blog post

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,690
on the web a million that we should aim

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,519
to do one thing this week to broaden

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,399
your understanding of how people use the

00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:39,019
web and adapt your designer development

00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:43,100
practice to incorporate what you've

00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:46,010
learned so not just to go learn it but

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,110
now make it part of your process build

00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,620
that into your process so that it

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,360
becomes just something you always do

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,789
also in the interest of learning more

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,419
about web accessibility tomorrow morning

00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:01,299
there's a talk here 10:50 a.m. web

00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:03,230
accessibility made easy for WordPress

00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:04,970
you should go to it

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,289
there's always accessibility talks that

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,519
word camps and there's always a lot of

00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:09,559
empty seats in the room and that

00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,120
shouldn't be the case because we all

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:16,880
should be learning this we all should

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:20,659
know it number three be an advocate and

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,490
a gatekeeper so a few weeks ago I was in

00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:25,100
North Carolina to go to work camp

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:28,220
Raleigh and I attended a really great

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:32,000
talk by Lisa Lynn Allen called we are

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:35,149
the gatekeepers and she pointed out that

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,769
as the people who actually do the kind

00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:39,679
of physical work of building a website

00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:41,769
we're the last ones to really touch that

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,330
before it goes out to the public and

00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:47,000
that there's actually a lot of power in

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,470
that position right like she said nobody

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,029
can like hold your fingers to the

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,740
keyboard and make you code something a

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:56,990
certain way and that we can use that

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,480
position to become an advocate for the

00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:03,919
end user and an advocate for inclusive

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:08,539
design we can just refuse to do work

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,639
that's not that's not inclusive we can

00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:12,740
also make sure that our clients are

00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,730
getting informed and that they're aware

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,650
and then if

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,840
in a position where you hire people to

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,610
join your team and help you out out

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,950
there on a permanent or temporary basis

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:25,310
you can start demanding knowledge of

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,600
accessibility and inclusive design

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,340
because it's only when we all start

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,420
demanding that that people are gonna

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,040
start paying attention and learning and

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:38,160
the next thing is to broaden your

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,730
thinking about diversity so a lot of

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,910
diversity and tech efforts get a lot of

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:46,880
a lot of flack for being secretly just

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,400
efforts to hire more white women

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
able-bodied white women but we really

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,130
need to expand diversity to include

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,840
everyone and I think that will really

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:00,660
see huge strides forward an inclusive

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,220
design when we stop thinking it of it as

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,110
something we do for people with

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,970
disabilities and instead make it

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,900
something we do with people with

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:12,870
disabilities consider hiring people with

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,260
disabilities on your team and then

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:18,450
finally don't be paralyzed by the huge

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,580
amount of things there are to learn just

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,820
pick something and do something even if

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,520
it's not the perfect thing just keep

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,770
moving forward aim to make every project

00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,990
that you build more accessible than the

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,270
one before it and eventually you'll get

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,030
to a place where somebody asks you for

00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,830
Tripoli compliance and you're like no

00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:41,070
problem got this know exactly what I

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,630
need to do you can get there and we're

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:47,120
all in it together we can all help each

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,120
other out thank you so much

00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,270
[Applause]

00:24:52,390 --> 00:25:04,820
does anyone have any questions yeah yeah

00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:08,270
yes

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,040
um so what he said is there was a web

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,690
development agency that got sued

00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,160
directly by somebody who couldn't use

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,480
the web site because they have the you

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,390
know the little thing in the footer this

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,620
site built by and the person who

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,110
couldn't use the site was smart enough

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,910
to go around the business owner to

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:35,090
directly to the source who built the

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:38,390
site anything else yes I had a question

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:40,190
for some specific things you can do with

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,710
your site I mean there's there's alt

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,630
tags there's you know all the different

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,670
text formatting things like that is

00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,140
there do you have any specific things

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,480
you can talk about or a place where you

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,210
can find more specific ways to make your

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,430
website accessible yeah actually if you

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,400
go to either that ovum report of the web

00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:01,250
a million report they have both listed

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,020
out the top ten like accessibility

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,230
issues they found they I think they were

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,640
about the same between both I think that

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,170
lists like going and looking at that

00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,750
list and learning how to solve those ten

00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:14,270
issues it's probably gonna knock out 80%

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,190
of accessibility issues on a site that

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,690
you're working on I think that's a great

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,060
place to start is like the ten most

00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:23,600
common and I'll tell you already they're

00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:25,430
ten of the easiest to fix ironically

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,610
like the ten most common ones are ten of

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,050
the easiest ones to fix so that's a

00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:38,450
great place to get started to tackle

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:48,290
those ten most common okay let every new

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:49,940
microphone so you had mentioned that the

00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:52,520
best time to start is when you're first

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,110
starting out developing a website so if

00:26:52,520 --> 00:27:00,500
you've already started it just a little

00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:03,270
bit you still have hope and to be honest

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,040
WordPress and most WordPress themes

00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,810
a leg up like include a lot of

00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,430
accessibility out-of-the-box the

00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:12,660
WordPress accessibility team is very

00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,920
hardworking and very it's an advocate

00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,040
for accessibility in WordPress in

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,690
general um so yeah I would take a look

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,330
at like those ten most common things and

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:24,830
just check your site for those that's a

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,830
good place to get started thank you yeah

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:31,970
anyone else who's that Oh someone in the

00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:35,040
back sorry

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,390
does the web aim site does it list tools

00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,360
that you can use for accessibility

00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,100
testing on there - yes makes

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,570
accessibility tools but there's lots of

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,510
other people who make accessibility

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,760
tools - there's the company called duck

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,800
queue that makes a pretty nice browser

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,540
extension called axe and then there's a

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,410
newer version called axe coconut that

00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:57,150
are really nice to use there's another

00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,980
one called a wave that's really nice and

00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:02,510
actually if you use Firefox there's an

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,510
accessibility checker built right in

00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,770
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah the accessibility

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,590
checker is already there you don't even

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:24,840
have to add it built right in since 61 I

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:26,280
think yeah is that Thank You Natalie

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,850
that was really good can you write a

00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,010
book about that so I can give it to my

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:35,280
coworkers I was gonna ask you what would

00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,350
you suggest for people that you work

00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,000
with that are kind of resistant to this

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,680
or the like yeah we'll get to that we'll

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,380
get to that but I think your talk was

00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:47,220
really great things thank you I would

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,680
say to emphasize like the effort saving

00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,960
and then the budget and time saving of

00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,790
doing it from the beginning instead of

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,640
trying to bolt it on after the fact

00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:59,220
because it's a huge difference it's a

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,780
huge huge difference because looking for

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,110
project costing save ten thousand

00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,820
dollars it might cost eleven thousand

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,680
dollars to make it accessible from the

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,250
beginning but it might cost 20 thousand

00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,380
dollars to go back later and do it and a

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,220
lot of frustration and a risk of being

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,680
sued

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,680
[Laughter]

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:29,140
anyone else all right

00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:35,440
