East Coast time because I'm doing all

00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,390
right even though it's 9 a.m. but so

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,250
yeah so I would just like to start by

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,720
thanking the organizers of work camp Oh

00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,550
see this is such a great camp so far

00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,350
I've had a great time and as an

00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,180
organizer I know just how much work goes

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,950
into it so the volunteers the speakers

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,860
that the organizers everyone works super

00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,299
hard so thank you for that so this

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,610
session we're going to be talking about

00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,679
Gutenberg and I want to just start by

00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,840
saying that I am a Content writer I'm a

00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:15,159
content creator I'm not a developer so

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,229
this talk is going to be geared towards

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,939
content creators and I'm going to be

00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:21,969
talking about the power of Gutenberg and

00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:23,649
how we can use it as power users I'll

00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,909
talk a little bit about you know the

00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:27,039
different plugins that we can use to

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,959
boost our WordPress sites but I'm really

00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,209
going to be focusing on storytelling and

00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,130
how we can use Gutenberg to really boost

00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:35,170
our communication whether you're a

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,779
blogger or whether you manage a website

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,299
for your company or your organization so

00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:42,039
a little bit about me I mean you heard

00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,590
in my bio I am the content creator at

00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:46,329
SCI crown I studied journalism I live in

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,100
Montreal but you can also reach me on

00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,420
Twitter and that's my handle and the

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,020
last thing about me is that I would like

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,520
Gutenberg so for a lot of people when

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,200
Gutenberg first came out it was really

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,479
stressful and I understand from a

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,079
developer's perspective there's a lot of

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,939
reasons why that was an issue but coming

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,740
from a Content perspective I was just

00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,149
really excited about having more tools

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,340
that are going to be able to empower

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,800
just the average user to do even more

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,440
with WordPress and even more from

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,269
WordPress you know right out of the box

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,160
so I just want to mention I'm super

00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,600
lucky that psych round you know sends me

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,340
we're chance like this and gets to

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,810
travel and I also have a colleague

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,450
Francesca who's going to be talking in a

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,160
couple of hours so just super grateful

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,440
that I'm being here and able to

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,330
represent them so now that I've shared a

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,400
little bit about myself I do want to

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,920
know a little bit about you about the

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,220
people that are in the room so who here

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,530
is currently using Gutenberg alright

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,810
that's actually not bad you know I I

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,090
expected yeah it's like I know it's

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,500
always surprising to me nine months in

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,600
you know how many people are still

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,790
afraid to take that leap and sort of

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,160
I've been putting it off and then some

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,260
people that have sort of been making the

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,120
transition but slowly and aren't really

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,400
sure if they're using all the tools to

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,520
their maximum capacity so that's really

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
exciting so you know if you're not super

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,910
familiar with WordPress I know that word

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,950
camps attract a lot of you like

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,710
newcomers and new people to WordPress

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,440
just quickly and I hope you can see this

00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,630
well but this is sort of the transition

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,610
that we experienced with Gutenberg so in

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,110
the back you'll see the classic editor

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,760
which you can still have on your

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,190
WordPress website with the classic

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,220
editor plug-in and then you know after

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,980
WordPress 5.0 we had Gutenberg which is

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,630
this block based design where you can

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,450
have reusable blocks and you can really

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,610
customize how your site and how your

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,740
pages are laid out so that's sort of

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,420
some of the differences and so if you

00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,860
take a look at you know the right-hand

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,480
bar you'll see some of the tools are

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,060
similar than they were before but

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,420
they've been a little bit redesigned so

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,000
that's sort of you know the the bones of

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,220
it but before we get into the actual

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,739
tool I kind of want to back up a little

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,320
bit because I think the easiest way to

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,930
approach a new tool is to start with

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,850
inspiration and I think it's it's a fun

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,100
way to you know start with a creative

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,280
idea and then learn how to do that

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,070
practically so does anyone know what to

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,860
snow fall means is this something that's

00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:19,209
familiar to anyone so in the journalism

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,790
field when I was in school like eight

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,070
years ago in college we were talking

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,590
about how the future of journalism I

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,810
don't know if you guys have you know

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,370
friends or maybe nieces and nephews that

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,660
decided to study journalism but there

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,490
time when everyone was saying that was a

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,740
very bad idea this was an industry that

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,500
was dying why would you ever invest time

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,419
in journalism studies and then all of a

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,479
sudden the New York Times published this

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,550
amazing piece called snowfall and it was

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,370
about this avalanche that had happened

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,020
and that had caused a ton of casualties

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,910
it was a really big news story and

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,990
instead of just writing a couple of news

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,210
articles about it

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,850
they made the super beautiful and

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,710
interactive piece that went through all

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,630
the characters in this news story and

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,780
all the facts that had happened and they

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,300
how these interactive geographical you

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,610
know interactive elements and all of a

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,410
sudden this story just came to life and

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,960
this was something that hadn't been done

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,180
before using new web technologies this

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,970
was something that was very innovative

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:24,190
and you know so this came out December

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:26,289
20th 2012 and it received more than 3.5

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,229
million pageviews and 2.9 million

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:31,570
visitors within the first week nearly a

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,880
third of which were totally new to the

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,680
New York Times so now only were they

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,210
engaging their current audience but they

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,580
were attracting like a whole bunch of

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,639
new audience members to a platform that

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,860
people were saying was dying and so I

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,810
really like to look at this as sort of a

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,080
turning point in digital storytelling

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,510
and in using web technologies to bring

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,789
stories to life and to bring news and

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,590
communication to life and so I love

00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,270
using this example as a way that you

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,570
know we can craft these stories that use

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,000
media and maps and images and fun

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,320
layouts in ways that can boost you know

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,849
whether you're telling a story like this

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,229
or whether you're trying to sell a

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:11,289
product or whether you're trying to

00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:13,900
engage your audience on your website so

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:16,240
I like to say that with Gutenberg anyone

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,760
can develop a snow fault you don't need

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,250
to have a newsroom with you know ten

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,590
digital news reporters you can do this

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,010
with Gutenberg to a certain extent and

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,960
I'm gonna show you how so at this point

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,570
you might be thinking like I don't need

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,599
all of these things but I'm gonna walk

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,250
you through like a couple of new trends

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,840
that I've seen in marketing and I'm

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,969
gonna show you how to specifically use

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,870
Gutenberg to implement them on your

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:43,730
website

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,949
so if you know if you're not familiar

00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,540
with the actual Gutenberg interface I'll

00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,540
just kind of walk you through really

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,750
quickly how it works because a lot of it

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,090
and out is yeah it works more with like

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,820
a hover situation so if you hover over

00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,260
your editor you'll have this pop-up and

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,240
you can add blocks and then you can

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,639
scroll through your blocks and see

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,110
what's available to you based on the

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,330
plugins that you have built into your

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,880
site and the ones that are coming out

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,860
with WordPress right out of the box so

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,389
if you hover over your editor you can

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,430
also search the blocks that are

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,020
available on your site and you can the

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,540
ones that you use most frequently will

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,410
come to the top and then when you select

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,680
one of these let's see if I can get that

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:29,389
no all right so when you select a block

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,669
then all of a sudden you have this new

00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,800
tab on the side that you can use to edit

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,229
the content of that block so you can

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,490
change the color you can change

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:40,220
depending on what the block is you can

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,110
have a lot more settings and I have some

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,190
demos on my website that I will tweet

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:49,160
out later so with these new blocks I've

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,740
broken them down into these categories

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,270
because I think that kind of covers a

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,860
lot of the different use cases images so

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,050
we have text blocks

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,990
so that's your paragraph let headings

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,849
subheadings table button classic block

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,050
text columns these are things that are

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,300
going to allow you to manipulate the

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,130
text on your website it's going to allow

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,280
you to add more character to it it's

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,599
going to allow you to create more of a

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,760
defining hierarchy for it and that's

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,530
going to also help you organize your

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,660
thoughts and help your readers engage

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,690
with your content in a more engaging way

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,910
I'm going to repeat that engaging so you

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,830
have like it's a lot it's gonna be a lot

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,960
easier also to do things like columns

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,160
which were more complicated before so

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,349
you can do these right out of the box

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,240
with Gutenberg the next thing is media

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,310
that's an easy one if you want to have a

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,620
more interactive and engaging website

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,900
media is an easy way to do that of

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,250
course you have you know some extra

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,839
challenges with media because you want

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,190
your website to load quickly so you want

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,540
to make sure that you have it set up so

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,030
that you're not bogging down your

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,589
website but there's a lot of ways in

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,470
Gutenberg that you can just play around

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,750
with images and video and you know even

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,030
if you

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,100
Podcast can easily embed audio into your

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,310
website and start building up a really a

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,450
really media rich website and then

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,340
quotes are something that I have

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,260
separate from twice text just because I

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,580
feel like there are a lot of they're

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,680
underused you know there's a lot of cool

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,360
ways where if there's a big wall of text

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,770
people are gonna just kind of disconnect

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,690
from it but if you have a couple of pull

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,510
quotes it can really help people see

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,970
what the salient points are of that page

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,400
and layout sub columns I was mentioning

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,440
like that's a huge change being able to

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,480
control the columns on your text on your

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,340
website without having to do a lot of

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,400
coding is it's just really awesome and

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,440
then adding some separations and

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,850
pagination and then the code one so you

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,350
know if you've been using short codes

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,750
then you know that you know that's a

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,730
really fun way to build pages and with

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,240
Guttenberg that hasn't gone away it's

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,770
just even easier so now that you know

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,440
you've seen a couple of the different

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,630
block types let's talk about how you can

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,340
implement them so I want to focus on

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:58,260
text first add style to your text so

00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,190
every website has content and if you

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,240
don't have content on your website

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,910
you're doing something wrong because

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,920
that's really a driving force of what

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,270
makes a website rich is people come

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,230
they're looking for information they're

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,240
looking for answers to their questions

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,220
they're looking for solutions to their

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,930
problems so whatever you have on your

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,900
text on your website you're conveying

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,120
those things with text but like I

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,130
mentioned people disconnect from big

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,339
walls of text people don't have the

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,900
energy to decide what's important in the

00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,120
text you kind of have to help them along

00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,530
the way and you have to point out what

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,390
they should be remembering and what they

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,040
should be engaging with on your page and

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,630
so that's why I think it's really cool

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,420
to start playing around with Guttenberg

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,330
and using some of the stylistic elements

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,220
that can help your text pop so that's

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:44,270
you know columns and quotes and headings

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,320
and hierarchy is a really underestimated

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,390
tool when you're when you're building

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,220
your page because when you have a

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,560
hierarchy in your text it allows people

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:58,050
to also understand what your main points

00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:01,680
are and for you to sort of create a real

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,660
cohesive and powerful page so this is

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,490
just sort of a demo that I did of how

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,540
you can use the different blocks and how

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,000
when you hover over them you have more

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,430
options so this is an example of you

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,639
know really like strong quote element

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:18,070
quote block and when you take a look at

00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,690
it live you know it kind of has all of

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,759
these and this is just I've sort of like

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,620
tossed a bunch of stuff in so I would

00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,630
probably style it a little bit more but

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,220
that's just an example of that diversity

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,959
of things that you can build onto your

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:34,870
page without actually having to touch

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:37,720
any of the HTML itself so diversifying

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,449
your images I think building your site

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,100
based on the theme that you've chosen is

00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:45,040
great because a lot of themes will

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,079
really make the most of images but what

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,779
Gutenberg allows you to do is to have

00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,600
more control page by page and post by

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,610
post of how your images behave and

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,990
appear so a lot of the times you know if

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,600
you're not if you're not comfortable

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,149
with code you're really relying on the

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,949
design of your theme and that can be a

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,860
little disheartening because maybe you

00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:07,720
want to have a really cool wide image on

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,130
your site but that's not built into your

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,079
theme and so you end up switching themes

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,240
a lot or child theming and you're not

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,089
really sure how you can get exactly what

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,579
you want and so I like to play around

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:21,130
with a different a different like media

00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:23,740
blog and I find that with Gutenberg

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,290
there's some really cool hacks that work

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,230
we were able to do before that now with

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,360
some of the blocks can help specifically

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,680
a landing page design if you are in

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,720
marketing and you want to create some

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,940
pages that have a lot of content but

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,069
have some call to actions then you can

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,709
actually use some of these gallery

00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:43,120
blocks to do that so here's a fun

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:45,279
example so I just have kind of like a

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,110
very basic gallery and then one where

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,910
you can overlay some text which is a new

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,470
feature which is kind of cool but then

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,089
this other example that I have on the

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,980
forefront you know these are little

00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:56,560
thumbnails basically they're little

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,639
icons and I'm using the gallery block

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,290
for that but you can make those

00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,930
hyperlinked and all of a sudden you have

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,610
kind of this mini menu on your page and

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,529
you can you know make that a reusable

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,720
block and then you can use it from page

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,759
to page and that's just a pretty regular

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,980
gallery block so there's some really

00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,500
cool ways that you can switch it up with

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,510
your images and add some diversity and

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,610
make your page that much more

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,780
interesting without really having that

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:25,900
much design knowledge or code knowledge

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:27,670
so integrating other post types this one

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,730
sounds dry but it's probably the most

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:33,070
exciting one because if you think about

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,350
the way that WordPress is built you have

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,690
post types so you've got your blog post

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,760
but you might also have testimonials you

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,960
have projects these are different post

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,480
types and if you have installed

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,640
something like custom post types then

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,350
you can build your own post types like

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,020
if you work for a school you might have

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,460
the staff members or the teachers are a

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,040
post type and then you might have

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,320
authors as a post type you know you

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,360
might have other things that are built

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,850
specifically for your website but this

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,550
is all content that is on your WordPress

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,470
site and so with Gutenberg and with

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,470
certain plugins you can make it a lot

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,570
easier to draft and to craft these pages

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,240
that pull in all these different parts

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:16,390
of your website in a way that's curated

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,370
for your purposes and your needs and so

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,930
a lot of times you know you're kind of

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,670
using short codes to do that and you're

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,780
sort of like I don't know for me

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,850
personally when I was trying to build

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,500
these pages before Gutenberg I would

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,360
just kind of have that page open with

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,650
all the short codes and be copy pasting

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,780
and looking for my tags and my

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,420
categories but all this content on your

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,860
site is there and ready to use so it's

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,770
just so much more empowering to know

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,690
that with Gutenberg there's fewer steps

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,120
in crafting these pages and what I mean

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,790
by crafting pages is you know let's say

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,160
that you are a freelance writer but you

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,900
have lots of multiple niches like maybe

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,230
you write about food you write about

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,210
lifestyle you write about real estate

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,400
and so when you're sending your

00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,380
portfolio around maybe you want the

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,050
editors that you're contacting to have a

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,960
really clear idea of what you can do for

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,990
each niche and so you might want to

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,520
start building using the short codes and

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,220
pulling them a different content from

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,900
your website a crafted experience for

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,850
that editor to really get a picture of

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,740
what you're able to do for that niche

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,740
and that's an example it's kind of banal

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,900
but it could go for products if you are

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,040
a company and you sell lots of different

00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,920
products but you have different

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,930
audiences or you're an organization that

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,000
has a Kids program and it is all

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,339
program and a senior's program like if

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,380
you have multiple audiences then you can

00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,240
curate these pages that will speak to

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,130
that audience by pulling in the

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,410
different content from your site in a

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,510
way that you've controlled so here I

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,760
have just like portfolio writing a

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,520
shortcode and I'm pulling in articles

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,040
that are only for one tag and so then I

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,140
have examples for that one and then I've

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,420
also added some call-to-action buttons

00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,100
few more articles in the bottom download

00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,080
my CV you know different things that

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,390
might be useful for you now you can

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,880
basically with blocks decide exactly

00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,680
what that that order is going to be and

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,899
how people are gonna engage with your

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,970
page so spicing it up with multimedia I

00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:16,330
think this is kind of like calling back

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,490
to the snowfall example that we

00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,860
shouldn't be afraid of trying new things

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:25,060
and being a little bit more experimental

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,100
with video and with animations and with

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,050
audio I think that you know there's

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,220
there's room for that on the web you

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,320
want to be careful as well you don't

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,690
want to overload people with kind of too

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,520
much media but I think it's a really

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,709
exciting time with the Guttenberg that

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,000
you can play around with videos that

00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,740
you've done in your iPhone and you can

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,720
embed them on your website if you have

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,820
heavier videos maybe have a third party

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,830
like host them on Vimeo or YouTube and

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,640
embed them on your site and with good

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:53,830
ingredients any URL for a video and

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,839
it'll just appear and not only will it

00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,459
appear and have this really like nice

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,470
player but he'll be able to have

00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,970
controls on the side if you want to

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,500
start it at a certain time if you wanted

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,809
to loop if you wanted to play without

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,880
audio like just things that you would

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,110
want but maybe you'd have to download an

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,730
extra plug-in to do that or you'd have

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,920
to pay for an extra service to have

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,360
those now it's built into Guttenberg so

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,110
it's a lot easier to play around with

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,500
video and embed it one thing that I also

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:22,839
think a lot of websites should have it's

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,740
just more white space so this is kind of

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,840
a design approach to to content which is

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,429
you know white space is kind of a space

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,250
that you have with no content with no

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:35,620
things and I believe that there's power

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,390
in white space because it allows your

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,460
content to breathe and it allows the

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,120
focus to be driven to where it needs to

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,400
go

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,799
and it allows the reader to not be

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,150
overwhelmed and so with Gutenberg you

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,720
know I don't know if ever if you guys

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,100
ever had trouble with hard returns and

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,690
adding spaces and the spaces not

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,710
appearing when you publish and all these

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,630
different things that are like such a

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,610
nightmare until you figured out that the

00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,740
coding hacks to make it work but now

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,049
with Gutenberg you can use columns you

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,549
can build tables that's awesome you

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,740
don't even have to code the table you

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:09,159
can just use Gutenberg you can use page

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,929
breaks and spacers and like a read more

00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,240
button a separator all these things that

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:16,090
are going to allow you to draft a page

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,500
in a way that is just more has more room

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,909
to breathe and I just think that's a

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,990
really nice thing that is often

00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:24,940
underutilized filming a call to action

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,620
so a call to action is kind of like it's

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,559
a marketing word you know you kind of

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,080
want people to buy now or subscribe but

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,909
the concept of a call to action exists

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,649
on every website I don't doesn't matter

00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:37,360
what kind of website you have the call

00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:39,580
to action is there because you might

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,500
want someone to subscribe to your blog

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,840
you might want someone to subscribe to

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,490
your newsletter you might want someone

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,049
to keep reading like that's what these

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,720
are all call to actions because you're

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,789
asking your website visitor to engage

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,350
with your site in a certain way and with

00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:55,120
Guttenberg you can make those call to

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,309
actions a lot more powerful and a lot

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,980
more meaningful as well because you can

00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:01,990
customize the buttons and you can design

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,750
these call to actions with a couple of

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,760
different tools so here I have you know

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,610
on my website I don't know if this video

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,039
is going to work but I have just like a

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:15,610
regular text block and then I've added

00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:18,159
some color to it and then you know in

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,140
the example again I had this demo but I

00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,130
have it on my website as well but you

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,539
can use the different blocks that are

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,490
designed for buttons and the fun thing

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,590
about it is that you can round the

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,970
corners you can change the color these

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,039
are all like little things that are just

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,750
gonna save you so much time because you

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,549
don't have to get a designer to design

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,529
your own button you don't have to get it

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,149
you know in an SVG file and like

00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:41,710
uploaded and have it appear you don't

00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,840
have to like mess around with the CSS

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,720
you can just use Gutenberg's built-in

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,640
tools and have your call to actions show

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,260
up another hack that I wish it was

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,690
showing but I'll just talk you through

00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,090
it is you can use images as call to

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,860
so if you have the image block I showed

00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,960
you before that you could add text over

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,390
top and so that's actually kind of a

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,640
neat way to turn that into a button so

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,140
you can design an image have the text

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,650
over it hyperlink it and all of a sudden

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,300
you have this really cool engaging

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,740
graphic that is actually a button and

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,900
it's actionable for people to engage

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,540
with so these are just some of the hacks

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,120
that you can use using Guttenberg to

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:24,770
help your reader take the next step on

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:29,020
your site simplifying your workflow

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:32,030
so with Guttenberg they really have

00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,890
content creators in mind and what I mean

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,360
by that is you know you have all these

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,220
really empowering tools that make it

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,380
easier if you don't have the coding

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,940
knowledge to create things that maybe

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,910
you had in your mind but didn't have the

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,560
tools to do before and the other thing

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,140
that they've made really easy is being

00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,670
able to create reusable blocks so I'm

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,220
not sure why this video is working with

00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,690
the last one didn't but we'll just enjoy

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,430
it

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,340
so here's an example of creating a blog

00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,010
and so here I'm changing the color and

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,690
you know you can really if you are

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,430
working with a designer or maybe you had

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,500
a designer once who just gave you a

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,510
branding Bible you can just use the

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,980
color scheme that they've given to you

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,540
make sure that all your pages are

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,430
cohesive with the colors that they've

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,080
they've given you or if you've designed

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,080
your own you can just stay consistent

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,320
and you can then give that block a name

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,490
and save it and that's gonna just appear

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,500
in your like library of blocks and the

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,730
fun thing about these reusable blocks is

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,310
that they're gonna appear in your search

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,870
every time and if you work with multiple

00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,070
people so let's say that you're a

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,420
business owner and you have someone

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,490
doing your social media and you have

00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,500
someone doing your products and you're a

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,210
small team but different people manage

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,070
different parts of the website by

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,900
creating reusable blocks you're sure

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,180
that everyone is on the same page and

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,100
everyone is using the same blocks and

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,390
the same look so that's one nice thing

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,890
and it's also going to help with your

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,420
onboarding so if you have new people

00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,250
that are joining the team you can just

00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,570
show them and say we you know you don't

00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,880
have to reinvent the wheel we've done

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,860
this before and we've saved our work so

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,870
you can just reuse it the other fun

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,830
thing about reusable blocks is that if

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,929
you want to

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,669
design call to actions on a certain

00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:09,350
number of your pages or if you have

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,450
campaigns that are more time-sensitive

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,399
you can create these reusable blocks

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,649
apply them to the pages that need them

00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:18,529
and then go out and just remove them and

00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:21,919
you'll have you know I've really more

00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:23,510
control over how your pages act and you

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,299
know the blocks that you reuse for

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,490
time-sensitive things like that so there

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:31,279
are some plugins that can also restrict

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,500
the use of the blocks so if you have

00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,210
blocks that you just want to show up for

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,490
certain logged in users or based on

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,289
permissions there's also so many

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,600
developers that are building on these

00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:43,279
concepts and creating more tools that

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,809
are going to allow newsrooms to have

00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,090
more control over the reusable blocks

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:49,610
and other you know things like that and

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,110
membership sites as well so I think it's

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:55,580
we're just sort of at the beginning of

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:57,260
this Gutenberg growth where a lot of

00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,419
people are trying to solve problems or

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,120
make Gutenberg better for different

00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,799
types of use cases and so I just

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,470
encourage people you know if you are

00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,750
running your own show any opportunity to

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,549
save time is worth taking advantage of

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,960
and reusable Gutenberg blocks are a

00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,940
great example because you can just

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,330
design it once have it there and then

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,240
reuse it across your website so if we

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,450
look at the tips that I've given so far

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,519
I'll say yeah stylize your text don't be

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,649
afraid to try different things and to

00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,840
have pull quotes and to make the text

00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:32,269
come alive the next thing is to add

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,370
images you know I think websites with

00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:36,889
strong images perform better people stay

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:40,399
on the page longer maximize your post

00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:42,260
types if you don't leave it up to chance

00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,330
for your reader to know where to look on

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,130
your page or where to click next if you

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,919
can create these really great landing

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,440
pages with articles or call to actions

00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,000
or services and products and you have

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,100
control over that I think it's going to

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,960
be much more effective for you whether

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,450
you're selling something or trying to

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,980
raise money to use the custom post types

00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:04,100
that you have in your site and pull them

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,899
into these pages add audio and video if

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,929
that's useful for you if that's part of

00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:10,669
your brand then by all means and add

00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:13,250
whitespace you know don't kind of Jam

00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:15,020
pack it all in use the tools that we

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,380
have add a call to action

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,060
don't leave your

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,980
visitor hanging give them the next step

00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,870
give them something to do and then

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,080
create reusable blocks because it'll

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,970
save you time and headache I just want

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,920
to reiterate that some of the cool

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,230
things about Guttenberg are that it

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,060
makes your sites more responsive without

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,530
you having to do a lot of work and

00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,660
they're also mixed your site's more

00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:39,150
accessible and the reason why I bring up

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,790
accessibility and I'm not an

00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:44,190
accessibility expert at by any means but

00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:46,380
I have seen that with Guttenberg one of

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,880
the neat things is back in the day if

00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,070
you didn't have the tools to design

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,400
something on a website maybe you were

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:56,250
tempted to go into canva or into you

00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,280
know something like mspaint or you would

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,350
go into it and another tool and then

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,880
build something export it as a JPEG and

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,550
then you would put it on your website

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,440
because it looked nice but then screen

00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,820
readers have no way of reading the

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,620
content that you've designed and

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,880
embedded on your site and that's a

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,190
problem because when you have people

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,470
that have visual disabilities and aren't

00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:19,260
able to engage with this static image on

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,580
the site you're losing a lot of people

00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,920
and you're just making the web less

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,450
accessible with Gutenberg you can now

00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,640
replace that you know if you wanted to

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,500
design something in you know Photoshop

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,840
and then embed it on your site now you

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,090
can build that right into Gutenberg and

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,190
you can add alt tags and you can add the

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,350
metadata that you need to make your site

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,970
more accessible without having to do a

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,110
lot more effort so I think that's

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,210
something that's been really positive

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:45,420
with Gutenberg as far as content

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:48,420
creation goes I want to share a couple

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,970
of plugins that I think have been really

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:53,130
great to build off of the Gutenberg

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,810
blocks that are built into WordPress

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,250
right out of the box so I'll leave that

00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,260
up for a while I'm also going to be

00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:01,770
tweeting out my slides with some more

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:05,070
demos as promised so these are just some

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:07,800
that like I mentioned with reusable

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,150
blocks and limiting access like these

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,760
are some plugins that are building on

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,950
these concepts and making them just that

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,270
much better or more precise for

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:19,590
different use cases and different

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:21,060
industries so I like some of these you

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,340
know some of them also you might notice

00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,930
as you play around with your WordPress

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,850
website that some of the plugins that

00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:29,210
you've had on your site for years are

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,890
starting to develop Gutenberg block

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,690
so it's not only that there are new

00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,850
plugins that are designed for Gutenberg

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,830
but old plugins - you are also starting

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,350
to design tools that really make the

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,090
most of these new blocks so you know if

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,550
you have Yoast or jetpack installed on

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,020
your website - very popular plugins most

00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,870
people have them on their site from day

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,790
one they have gutenberg blocks and so

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,290
you can play around with them without

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,000
you know downloading anything new or

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:58,160
installing anything new but I do like

00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,140
these plugins for building on and now

00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,390
I'm gonna leave some time for questions

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,830
because I know I showed you a lot of

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,200
different things and you probably all

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,370
have very specific means and use cases

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,010
and I would love to answer your

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:12,760
questions about Gutenberg and and

00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,760
content creation

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:46,320
but yeah and there are some some plugins

00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:48,840
with Guttenberg that allow you to cut

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,470
the plate with the CSS right in your

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,629
dashboard or in your editor but I'm not

00:27:52,470 --> 00:28:10,919
sure about creating an image over an

00:27:54,629 --> 00:28:12,419
image the answer is probably on the

00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,710
internet because someone's probably also

00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:20,120
looked at great cool I think I had a

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,120
question over here and I'll come back oh

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,210
okay

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,909
can you hear so wouldn't Gutenberg first

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,769
came out we kind of tried it really

00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:31,409
quickly and then we have a really

00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:33,990
content rich website and tried it and it

00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:35,700
was like all of our existing content was

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,159
just kind of a mess we go in and tweak

00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,899
older content a lot so kind of went back

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,460
in and went I don't even know what I'm

00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:44,429
doing here and didn't have this time to

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,019
kind of lock in and and learn it so I'm

00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:47,669
definitely inspired to do that but do

00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:50,009
you have any tips for when you go back

00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:53,250
into content that has been previously

00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:55,230
created with with Gutenberg and kind of

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,789
how to navigate that yeah that's a great

00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,279
question and I think a lot of people are

00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:00,960
experiencing that I personally on my own

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,809
website you know a lot of people said oh

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,970
do I have to go back and Gutenberg defy

00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:08,730
all of my past content and the answer is

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,370
no nothing is is gonna be broken because

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,289
Gutenberg is installed on your site what

00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,850
I tend to do is if I have a reason to go

00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:16,620
edit a past blog post me where there's a

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,500
broken link or I want to update some

00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,720
information I'll take that opportunity

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,690
to then transform it into a Gutenberg

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,370
and that's a pretty simple change so in

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,860
your dashboard or in your editor you can

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,860
go and you'll see that with your old

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,169
post all the content will be one block

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,149
and then you can then click and choose

00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:38,009
to separate it kind of like explode it

00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,840
into all these different blocks and so

00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,909
it's not as scary as it sounds like you

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,710
can go back into your old content turn

00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:44,820
all the different parts into blocks it

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,379
might not be perfect you know maybe

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,750
they'll split up to paragraphs that you

00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:49,220
actually wanted it to be one but

00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,010
those are minor things that you can

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,200
easily edit and so when I have content

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,150
that I'm updating if it's a quick fix

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,500
like maybe there's a typo I won't bother

00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,210
but if it's something that I actually

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,220
kind of want to make better and add

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,230
images to and maybe it's one of my top

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,510
blog posts then I'll make that our

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,460
priority to go back and to edit it and

00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,530
you know if you if you kind of want to

00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,179
do content audit it's a it's a fun

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,669
opportunity also to make a list of your

00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:15,770
top performing pages and to go and

00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:17,690
address those first and then use that

00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,850
little tool where you you know turn to

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,260
turn into blocks and then play around

00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:31,190
with it then does that answer your

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:32,900
question yeah yeah I mean if you have a

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,400
really important website you know it

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,950
could be an opportunity to just make

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,690
like a staging site to to kind of do

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,520
like a one-click staging site play

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,169
around with it and then once you feel

00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,270
more comfortable do the changes on your

00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:46,010
real on your real site I had one

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:50,049
question over here and then I'll it was

00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,850
a follow-up question if you don't know

00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:57,230
what's the actual function to explode

00:30:52,850 --> 00:31:00,049
the classic block into it's sort it's

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,390
just in the editor itself it's kind of

00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:03,590
like you click on a corner thing and it

00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,799
just says do you want to turn these into

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,140
blocks so yeah it's there on the site

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,169
and it's it's pretty easy to see in my

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:15,020
opinion but it is right there and it's I

00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:16,850
believe it's like transform into blocks

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,789
turn into block something convert yeah

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:25,090
and convert into block thank you okay

00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:28,909
over here so a reusable gutenberg block

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:31,370
does it act like a widget for example if

00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:33,890
you place that same reusable block on a

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:36,890
hundred pages and then you alter the

00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:41,419
content of that block will it change all

00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:45,080
100 pages from my test yes you can do

00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:47,150
that so it can change the block across

00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,799
your pages and then in other

00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:53,240
circumstances it's more like rigid so I

00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,679
don't know if anyone else has played

00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,659
around with the reusable blocks in this

00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,429
sense and can weigh in on this but I

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:00,500
know that with Gutenberg with the

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:01,580
jetpack blocks for example they do act

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,230
like widgets

00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,830
but then when I design my own text

00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,970
blocks they don't always change yeah I

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,769
don't actually have a great answer for

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,929
that question because it really it

00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,580
depends on the weather I'm using a

00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:16,220
plug-in or whether I'm using the built

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,749
in blocks with with Gutenberg so that's

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,409
probably something that is going to

00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:23,450
evolve as well I bet you 50 cents

00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:24,799
someone at this work camp will know the

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:33,859
answer oh absolutely

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:35,389
100% yeah I think do they act yeah if

00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:43,940
you tweak it on one page do they change

00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:46,820
everywhere else like to use the gallery

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,830
feature to create icons as buttons but

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,720
what I'm finding is that I can't

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,460
customize a URL it just wants to send me

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,200
to that image and I've always had a

00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,529
resort to using a plug-in is that what

00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,049
you found I first I was using the

00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:02,570
gallery that was built into Guttenberg

00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:04,609
and when I was playing around with it a

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,009
few months ago it wasn't a big fan so I

00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:09,470
did end up downloading another plug-in

00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:12,710
that had a custom Guttenberg block that

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:16,609
had more control and so I was to find a

00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:18,200
third-party block plugin to have exactly

00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:20,840
the kind of gallery with exactly the

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,639
type of link behavior that I wanted so

00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,409
yeah I would say that like I don't know

00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,179
Gutenberg is getting better you know

00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:27,980
right out of the box but at the time I

00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:33,019
wasn't satisfied with the way that the

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,489
the the links were being shown so yeah I

00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,749
mean it's kind of like that for a lot of

00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:36,919
different blocks like there's gonna be

00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:39,080
someone who's designed a better version

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,399
of it and then until you know until you

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,169
find the perfect one you kind of can

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,210
look around with who's designing what

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:46,129
but the link behavior is something that

00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,779
like I personally like having it open in

00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:49,639
a new tab and not like within the same

00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:51,559
tab so there's some things like that

00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:54,100
that I had to go and go fishing for the

00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,100
perfect one

00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:11,159
yeah there are a lot of websites that

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:14,070
are just really good WordPress tutorial

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,600
sites to begin with like wpbeginner and

00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,800
there's some other ones I know if you

00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,840
guys have any favorites you can just

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,760
kind of shout them out as well because

00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,169
they're all developing Gutenberg content

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,260
like this is something that they're

00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:26,490
working on as well so wpbeginner is the

00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,510
first one that comes to mind but maybe

00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:30,659
there's some other ones that other

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:32,250
people like Linda that's a great one

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,139
yeah so Linda's just great to learn a

00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:38,790
lot of things and they happen to have a

00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:41,159
really strong WordPress section which if

00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,379
you all are not aware if you live in

00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:48,600
Orange County or LA County lynda.com is

00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:51,149
free with your library card in Missouri

where is normally you have to pay for it

00:34:51,149 --> 00:35:00,300
