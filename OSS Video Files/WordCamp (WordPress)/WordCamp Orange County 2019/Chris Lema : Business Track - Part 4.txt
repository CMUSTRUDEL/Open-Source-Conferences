I've known Chris for many many years and

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,309
we often talk about we hang out together

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,420
we travel together we do lots of things

00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,150
together but we often talk about

00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,010
business and I do consider Chris a a

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,590
trusted partner of mine somebody I can

00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,240
call up and and just share honestly with

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,920
what's going on in my business and

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,510
things that challenges that I'm facing

00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,539
and it's the kind of things that we

00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,940
talked about regularly and so I did

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,500
invite him here today to share some of

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,899
those things as well with you so I'm

00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,789
gonna go ahead and let you start with it

00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:41,859
can't it can't be possible but with a

00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,749
failure where they learn about failing

00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:44,999
something you just make it up just maybe

00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:47,789
I just saw it on TV

00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:51,780
all right so how many of you have ever

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,179
haven't even ever worked on a puzzle

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,519
puzzle okay my wife loves puzzles when

00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,129
we go on a cruise we find the library or

00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:01,420
the room where they do puzzles and the

00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:03,639
first thing she does she gets the box

00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,570
out and she lays out the pieces and she

00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:10,420
does a puzzle okay so I want you to

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,580
imagine right given that I really

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,110
struggle with failure what it feels like

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,170
to work on a puzzle where you take a

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,910
piece and you try and place it like

00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,730
right next to the edge and then when it

00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:26,830
doesn't fit I just lose it

00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:29,980
ice cream is big and it's and that's how

00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:35,470
I deal with failure right right isn't

00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:38,470
isn't that how you guys deal with no no

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,710
how many of you have key rings with keys

00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,690
on it right and you put the wrong key in

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:50,010
the door and it doesn't fit and then

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:53,170
you're like right that's how you know

00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,460
okay so it turns out that I don't do

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,840
that with puzzle pieces I don't do that

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,730
with these and I don't do that when

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,750
something doesn't work at work or in

00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:03,430
life I don't call it a failure because I

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,050
don't call putting a piece in that

00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,490
doesn't fit a failure I don't call

00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,250
putting a key in that doesn't fit a

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,830
failure it's just that one didn't work

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,170
let's go to the next one if something if

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,329
I have a proposal at work and I want to

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,080
pitch it and it doesn't work I don't

00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:20,740
lose

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,180
I don't call it a failure someday I may

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,420
run I don't know when that's gonna

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,750
happen but if I was in a 5k for example

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:34,690
and someone with ahead of me right I

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:36,670
would be like I just okay right so I

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:41,290
think one of the problems we have with

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:43,870
failure is the label failure if you're a

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,100
teacher you know this right when we talk

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,870
about when if you are getting your

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,030
master's degree in education if you were

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,220
a teacher you would know that when you

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:55,060
ask a question to a classroom of

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,990
students and the first person answers

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,930
you don't say that's right

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:04,990
today in education we know that when you

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,480
say hey how do you know whether or not

00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,530
this is popular and five kids raise

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,000
their hand and you go to the first one

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,070
they go because a lot of people are

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,030
clapping and you don't say that's right

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:18,430
you say what else because if you say

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,010
that's right you have four or five other

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,790
people who put their hands down and just

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,030
go aye

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:29,350
I guess my idea was wrong and it wasn't

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,989
we look at things when we put in the

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,959
label failure what we're really doing is

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,060
creating negative self-talk or criticism

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,950
there's an entire field of psychology

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,270
that I love reading about which is

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:45,760
sports psychology and you watch what

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,760
high-performing athletes do and they

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,209
learn mantras like this won't kill you

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,230
or been here before gonna get through it

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:58,090
right if you're on a serious race if

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,940
you're in the Boston Marathon and you're

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,840
in the middle 13 14 miles

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,400
spread and it's hard you don't say hooks

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,140
and I'm not in first and this is a

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,640
failure in my life it's a failure and

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,180
everything I've done is trained for is a

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,510
fifth

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,640
you're like been here gonna get through

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,109
this right been here before gonna get

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,239
through this and that's how you push it

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:21,100
through a lot of times what happens when

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:25,900
we put the failure label on something is

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,430
we close down our thinking right there's

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,250
a tiny little bit of stress that happens

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,300
in our brain we go I failed so now I'm

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,710
bad right

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,740
talked about this earlier Chris Fordyce

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,120
I'm Matt I'm bad we limit options like

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,710
well if that didn't work therefore

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,909
nothing will work if I have a proposal

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,560
work that doesn't work

00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:43,330
I just find another way to bring it in

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,620
and then another way and I try it's like

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,699
keys going in the door that one didn't

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,740
work let's go to the next one that one

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,750
didn't work let's go next one so I've

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,900
learned a lot about failure mostly what

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,190
I've learned a lot about is how to

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,800
persist past it

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,830
right how not to give it that big label

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,750
because that big label starts narrowing

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,030
down options rather than trying to open

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,740
up options that make sense there's a

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,659
documentary that I think I turned you

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,520
onto recently on Netflix yeah right

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:13,870
awesome that's exactly what you're

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,030
talking about and if you haven't watched

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,800
it it's an 8 part documentary called

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,300
losers I just want to pause right there

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,210
when your best friend calls you and goes

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,900
hey you should watch losers maybe we

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:28,150
should maybe rethink your friendship see

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:34,659
that oh you should watch losers you

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:36,430
specifically if you haven't watched

00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:38,319
losers I highly recommend watching

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,610
losers because it's very much about what

00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,469
Chris was just talking about about

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:49,389
sports philosophy yeah right absolutely

00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:52,630
so I I years and years ago I was raising

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,520
money for startups right so three times

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,800
a week I would put on a suit I would

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,270
drive to Silicon Valley and I would do

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
probably three to four meetings a day

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:05,139
ten meetings a week asking other people

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,960
for millions of dollars and as probably

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:13,240
50 meetings in the year and we got one

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,800
yes right 49 knows one yes and I think

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,000
much like if you've ever worked with

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,060
Steve you know Steve's really good at

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,819
sales Steve probably makes you know not

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,930
that he does outbound calls but

00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,180
interacts with other people right see a

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,919
little dig but he may have he may have

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,659
forty nine conversations that don't go

00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,940
well but he knows all he needs is the

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:34,120
one right there is a certain dynamic

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:38,319
there's a certain skill in learning how

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,729
to let the forty nine go because all you

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,800
need is the one right all you need is

00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:44,320
one to work for it to move forward and

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,889
so a lot of times for me it's just a

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,120
it's just

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,620
the game in numbers it's just a game of

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,240
persistence if it doesn't work this way

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,520
it will work this other way so I work

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,800
really hard on plan B Plan C plan D plan

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,020
a plan a plan G and it just keeps going

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,759
right it's annoying to the people that

00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,979
are close to me because by the time

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,210
something hits and I go oh no problem

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,620
we'll just do this or we'll do that or

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,120
they're like how do you think about this

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,460
well I I spent the last two months

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,580
thinking about this right like I'm just

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,199
always prepared for the next failure and

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,389
how to move around it to get to the next

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,229
thing so he haven't given us any

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:22,120
specifics yes okay okay so on man one of

00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:26,080
the biggest failures of all time I was

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,610
responsible for hiring a SVP a senior

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,560
vice president for a software company

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,779
and I hired them they were awesome they

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,719
had spent 16 years at Microsoft as a

00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:39,370
Technical Evangelist they were

00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,960
everything we needed right I knew that

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,759
the guy was awesome right I knew he was

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,400
a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft

00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,589
because even when he mistakenly like his

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,560
bag fell down his badge from Microsoft

00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:52,449
fell out right he was he was the legit

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,669
thing if you're a Technical Evangelist

00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,409
at Microsoft it means you've passed a

00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,629
whole bunch of criteria already like I

00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,250
don't have to vet you I still I made a

00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:05,169
couple phone calls made sure he was

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:07,389
legit two days in to the job I asked him

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,919
to do something and he started getting

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,569
cagey you know that feeling where you're

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,039
like hey well show me what you got well

00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,199
I'm not ready to show you yeah but just

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:15,550
let me see what you know I just you know

00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,050
let's take a look at it tomorrow and

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,020
then tomorrow he doesn't show up to work

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,610
but his wife is at the hospital and

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,219
we're like whoa have some compassion

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,949
don't be a jerk so great let's call the

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:28,599
hospital and ask for mrs. green and send

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:31,149
her flowers except there's no mrs. green

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,529
so then we said an email and he's like

00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,329
well she's not at that hospital she's at

00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:35,769
this other hospital but she's already

00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:37,390
checked out she's at the house great

00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,919
since your address we'll send flowers

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:44,010
all we want I know what you're trying to

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,010
do what

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,410
when someone says I know what you're

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,270
trying to do and you were trying to send

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,070
flowers right just really awkward cuz

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,700
you're like I don't I don't really know

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,959
what you're saying I'm doing um so in

00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,300
the back of our head we started

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:03,290
wondering like what's going on what's

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,390
what's the issue and my boss comes in

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,459
and says hey how much vetting did you do

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,779
of this employee and and I'm like well I

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,029
called a couple appealed plus he's in

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:17,890
Microsoft he worked at Microsoft right

00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:20,360
in those days Microsoft didn't do

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,430
employment verification right like later

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,959
they did they didn't do references right

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,910
and it was a big deal back in those days

00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,440
technology and what they would say or

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,480
not say but they had just opened up a

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,950
service where you can pay $50 and punch

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,510
in the person's information and they

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,450
would tell you when when they work there

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:40,399
this guy spent 16 years at Microsoft or

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:43,070
at least that's what I thought I paid

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,459
the money right I paid the money and he

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,200
had worked there for six months right he

00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,000
was friends with we knew because when he

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,180
came into the interview like I wasn't a

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,740
 we had him physically show up

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,940
interview him right and clean my boss so

00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,700
I didn't feel like this was all my

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,020
failure but it was mostly my failure he

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,250
had mentioned that people he knew at

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,200
Bank America and we were doing deals

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,720
with Bank Americans so eventually I

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,110
called Bank America and they're like hey

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,790
you know like did Stan green do you do

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,670
you know stit and they're like who's

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,829
that like well he's the guy like

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,089
remember we saw each other oh I was

00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:18,920
saying hi to you guys I didn't know who

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,329
was with you and and he was like oh yeah

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,209
I worked with her for years when I was

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:25,040
over there it was far and so I mean it

00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,440
start falling through he said he went to

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,740
San Diego State or UC San Diego so we

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,990
called UC San Diego and I said okay like

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm guessing his age he'd be around here

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,829
and they're like no we don't have I'm

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,720
like oh sorry not in the computer

00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,399
science department she goes no no not

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,980
like we don't have anyone in computer

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,000
science department you know with that

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,279
name I'm like okay what about the

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,690
university no what about any time in all

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:54,980
of history have you ever had this person

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,390
no all right so then I wrote the email

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,579
that said

00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,370
I'm gonna need you to bring in your your

00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:03,640
transcript and this map because and he

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:07,240
just launched this massive email of bad

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,399
words and I was like well I guess I

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,700
guess that's your resignation right so

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,470
he worked for me for three days

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,360
but the amount of energy we had put into

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,120
hiring him and the amount of plans we

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,560
had set up for him that was a 30 or 40

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:27,610
thousand dollar failure when I was 27 or

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,620
28 and it I just I I do I was terrified

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,930
to hire for the next couple of years

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,019
right because you do something bad and

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,790
you think I'm bad right and it turned

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,570
out no just it was a mistake

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,920
it was a it was a it was a failure but

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,360
you have to eventually get back up and

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,269
start again right so these days of

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,850
course if you ever work for me if I

00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:51,550
don't know you just plan for a 6 or 8

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,870
week process like I won't hire fast I'll

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,310
fire fast but I'm not hiring fast

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,380
because I want to make sure we do

00:11:54,310 --> 00:12:06,060
everything right so hire slow hire slow

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:10,360
fire fast okay good any questions so far

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:12,399
do you want another one yeah I I had a

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,050
fall question but absolutely no no no we

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,959
only have nine minutes and there were 10

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:22,029
minutes I absolutely want another one so

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:24,269
uh how many of you send out quotes for

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:30,180
people to sign up for your services

00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:33,220
right yeah ok a good amount of you so I

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,079
sent out a quote to a client once right

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,209
we had this whole conversation to dad

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:37,959
the quote and they signed it and sent it

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,709
back right away

00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,579
and nothing about that sounded bad like

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,170
there was not awesome

00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,230
there was no failure their right you

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,970
send out a quote that says it'll be like

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,790
$9,000 and they sign back said great and

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:56,230
done and then you're in the middle of

00:12:51,790 --> 00:13:00,180
the work and he goes I'm super impressed

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:02,890
by the work you're doing for just $9,000

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,070
and you hear the word just and you're

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,070
like

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,620
what were you expecting to pay right and

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,380
he goes well we talked to a couple other

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,700
folks but I wouldn't do nearly what you

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,530
have on your list right like what you

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,720
have gone over and above we're talking

00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,880
couple other folks I think the cheapest

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,980
quote we had was like 75 thousand so we

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,470
said let's just throw it to this guy for

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,020
nine if he's a bozo it's not even like

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:34,550
it doesn't matter and if it works out we

00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:38,130
got it to you right now he's saying this

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:43,370
on life like we're trusted partners and

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,370
friends but I'm like you're a jerk like

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,120
so from then on I have never sent out a

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,590
single price right I always send out

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,700
three so tears

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:55,320
here's 80% of what you want right for

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,020
the price I'm willing to do the project

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,020
for here's a hundred ten percent of what

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,340
you want for you know a bigger price

00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,620
right and then here's what you might

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,970
need two years down the line if you

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,100
really want to pay and get going down

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:12,180
and go for success and push that price

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,860
up and and I have I have been far more

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,920
committed to asking a lot more questions

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:21,570
like how do you talk to anyone else are

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:28,470
you do you have a set budget what's your

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:30,990
range learn a lot from again doing doing

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,420
that one really really wrong have you

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,470
done this kind of thing before what did

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,470
you pay in the past

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:44,750
[Laughter]

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:50,190
awesome so so on the on the the pricing

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:53,190
what you just explained you know I just

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,300
I just lost my question I did my

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,830
question it would come back to me for a

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,340
second it would come back to me a second

00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:04,590
questions for Chris on on on that story

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:05,760
yes might come and hang on a second so

00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,260
what happens if you ask the question

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,210
such as what's your budget or what's

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,090
your range and you don't get back an

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:14,460
answer that gives you an idea so and

00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:17,460
then how would you then present a coat

00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,390
that's allows you do yeah yeah so so

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,150
what happens if they don't give you a

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,500
range backer

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,250
they don't give enough information right

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,870
so I I learned this trick from when I I

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,410
went to go build a pool in my backyard

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,870
okay so I invited a vendor to come to

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,510
the house and put fake grass in the

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,640
front of the house bait grass in the

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,980
front little square right my son's

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,680
allergic graft so like just fake grass

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,450
in the front call the vendor over but

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,880
I'm in a meeting in my office so my wife

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,150
takes a meeting and I tell her just bake

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,490
grass in the front get me a number and

00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:54,490
and so two hours later I'm done with a

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:58,270
call I come out of the office and the

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,680
dude is sitting in my living room and so

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,500
I look at my phone like what happened

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,140
and she said well he said that project

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,540
was too small but he said he'd be more

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,360
than happy given that I told him all

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,870
about what we wanted in the backyard and

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,710
I'm like wait what and she said remember

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,940
the other day you were telling about

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,170
what we're gonna do in a backyard you're

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,760
on the pool you are the waterfall you

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,020
want the cave behind the waterfall then

00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,490
you want the big jacuzzi on this end

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,950
plus the fire pit over here and the

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,800
shade and then the trees in the back

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,120
thank you that's why the vendors sitting

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,220
in my house he's been waiting for two

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,060
hours she goes oh by the way I told him

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,080
we're not those people that need to

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,080
finance we'll just pay straight cash

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,070
oh thank you sweetheart

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,010
you're amazing mentioned how awesome you

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:47,020
are today and so the guy says let's

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,280
review what you want of course and so we

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,330
go in the backyard he looks her

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,070
everything he's talking about the pool

00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,350
and everything else and then he says

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,870
what's your budget now I've written a

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,730
book on pricing right so I am NOT gonna

00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,380
negotiate with myself you think I'm

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,160
gonna give you the first number then and

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:05,140
I said out loud no dude I'm not the pool

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,120
expert I haven't built pools before you

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,680
do this you've done this for what 20

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,209
years he goes yeah 22 years ago you done

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,430
straight 2 years you know what it's

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:15,870
gonna cost you tell me what this is all

00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:20,170
gonna cost and instead of answering me

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:22,240
he says well in 22 years what I've

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,459
discovered is that most people do have a

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,000
number in their head but it's about 50%

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:31,450
of what it will actually cost and I

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,340
blurt out I'm not spending 150 grand on

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:41,410
this thing and he goes so you're a bunch

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:44,140
of 75 I learned that from my pool guy by

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,940
the way what did he do he gave us a

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,800
quote for just the pool - this the

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,900
basics the waterfall but no caves

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,230
beneath it right if you want the cave

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:56,050
add-on right if you want solar to heat

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,820
up the pool add-on right and by the time

00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,320
we were done we were back up $250,000

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,630
right and you're like this is insanity

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,980
but he played it played it perfectly so

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,870
when someone tells me they don't have a

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,730
budget then you start navigating around

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,870
it to say well you know here's an

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,670
experience here's an experience or you

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,710
might tell them about other projects and

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,450
as you're telling them you might drop

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,040
the you know anchor of the price so this

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,810
is a project we did this has the

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,010
automated marketing this has that was

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,630
thirty five thousand and you're watching

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,370
them in the eye where they're like no

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,960
you know you don't have to do everything

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,340
that we did for there but it is just to

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:33,750
give you an example here's this other

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:33,750
one oh oh that's painful

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,960
hang on one second

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:52,090
I think we're okay okay so I might I

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,070
might use two or three examples to

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,299
anchor them on price and say we don't

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,350
need to do all of this or we don't need

00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,480
to all this but we can do some of these

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,970
things and just help them understand

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,210
where the where the guidelines are does

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,799
that make sense oh I'm just a reflect

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,990
with Chris said what I'm doing that I I

00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:10,059
do the exact same thing and I say here's

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,409
a project it's not exactly like what

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:14,020
you're thinking I always start with that

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:16,150
right this is not exactly this is not an

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,770
apples to apples match but here's that

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,200
cut because that leaves me the door open

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,399
to say those kinds of things yeah right

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,710
so I start with that

00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:25,059
I remember my question right my question

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,620
was I know that you this wasn't your

00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,120
intent when you quoted the nine thousand

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,909
dollar project a lot of people play the

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,409
pricing game right by quoting low giving

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:34,870
an exact scope for what they're doing

00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:36,250
like your pool guy yeah right and so I

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,559
wanted you to expand on that a little

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,630
bit if you wanted to play the pricing

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,700
game you can absolutely be the low price

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:46,990
leader right as long as you're willing

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,820
to narrow down the dynamics you probably

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:52,720
don't know this unless you're super

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:55,149
astute but the size of your peanut

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,730
butter ours have been changing over time

00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:00,250
and you're like wait what your peanut

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,200
butter jar pricing hasn't and so you're

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,020
like oh look it's still the same jar

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,510
that I bought five years ago no grab the

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,690
jar flip it over and look at the dimple

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,190
on the bottom they've been slowly this

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:16,240
is an entire conspiracy I'm just letting

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,440
you in on they've been slowly taking

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,659
away peanut butter from the peanut

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,559
butter jar for years right by changing

00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,750
the size of that dimple

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,820
why because fundamentally they can keep

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,039
the price of the peanut butter jar the

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,140
same and give you less peanut butter

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,730
what does have to do with this you can

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,649
do the exact same thing depressing you

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,390
can keep your price at nine thousand

00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,580
dollars give them less oh you need to

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,039
migrate the site over that's separate oh

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,120
you need to test the performance of the

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,190
oh that's separate oh you need a

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,690
responsive designer that's separate but

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,570
the base of the design of your website

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,010
or the base of your installation of

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,860
WooCommerce or whatever it is that's

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,419
this price so you can start with a lower

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,280
price right as long as you're letting

00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:56,380
them know here are some of the extras

00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,490
and then they'll walk themselves up to

00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,540
wherever they're comfortable and if

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,580
you've ever competed in the our

00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,380
P game especially government RFPs that's

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,200
how they work typically they're looking

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,590
for price but you can play that game by

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:13,420
by defining very narrow scope and adding

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:18,000
on quite other questions for Chris in

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:20,590
daily killing it all by myself

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,420
any other stories you want to share no

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,780
I'm good thank you guys so much have a

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,780
