Beth Livingston hi everybody I'm really

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:53,660
happy to be here don't you just love

00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:56,269

00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,660
camp for geeks I love it

00:00:56,269 --> 00:01:01,160
so I love being here today I'm going to

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,749
talk to you about how to leverage your

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,400
project management methodology to set

00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:07,010
yourself above and apart from your

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,600
competition first let me give you a

00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,759
little bit more detail about Who I am

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,360
now full disclosure that was a

00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,250
professional headshot I had done in 2006

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,299
2006 when I did a little theater work

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,130
and I'll tell you another little thing

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:20,299
about theater it's when you get up on

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,180
the stage and you're pretending to be

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,770
somebody else very easy no nerves but

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,350
when you're up here being yourself in

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,299
front of all your peers that's somewhat

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,710
my mouth is dry so that's why I have

00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,729
this lozenge in the side of my mouth

00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,560
here ice apologize for that so I have

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,590
master's degree in education and when I

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,110
got out of graduate school I keep

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,549
forgetting there's a screen appearance

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,460
when I got out of graduate school I

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:50,360
started as an instructional designer and

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:53,149
then that morphed into working for as a

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,520
business analyst in IT for 20-some odd

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:57,469
years and that's where I really cut my

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,909
teeth on project management work for

00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,280
some really brilliant men who actually

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,719
were much more visionary than even they

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,770
realized at the time and I'll tell you a

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,920
little bit about that and it's just a

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,690
second then in 2009 I started building a

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,310
web app so you know I was when the

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,180
couponing craze was the whole big deal

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,819
right

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,739
and so but I hate good parking so I

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,900
wanted to create a system where you

00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:19,970
could save money on groceries just show

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,980
me where my stuff is on sale all right

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,629
so I built this web app and I was trying

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,760
to build it I had this friend helping me

00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:28,730
who's dotnet programmer and then he got

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,049
a girlfriend and so he was never

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,239
available when I need him to be

00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,739
available so I said come on Chris

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,629
there's got to be an easier way I'm

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:38,060
highly technical you need to give me

00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:44,450
some some tool I can work with so he

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:46,010
sent me Joomla I didn't get that but

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,170
then I discovered WordPress and that's

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,639
when I started using that to do my own

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,040
websites and then I started working

00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:56,000
doing that for other people I left the

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,280
corporate world in 2016 and decided I

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,840
was going to build these road maps these

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,299
training road maps for WordPress people

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,189
right like how to do a membership site

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,120
front to back top to bottom everything

00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,250
you need to do a membership site

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:16,209
everything you need to do an e-commerce

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,209
site well any of you know Adam Preiser

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:22,669
WP crafter anybody know WP crafter well

00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,250
there was no need in me trying to come

00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,280
to compete with the man he can he create

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,409
some twenty videos a day and he does

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,209
exactly that so he was doing these

00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,889
roadmaps for people you know complete

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,230
solutions so that kind of threw that

00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,730
idea out of the window and then and

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,349
that's how you change time what my

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,379
business is like I told her I would tell

00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:45,139
you that today but and if anybody has

00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:47,060
new people that need training his

00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:50,870
facebook group and his YouTube channel

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,760
can really get people to the finish line

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,620
a lot faster he's really good sometimes

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,359
I have to put him on fast speed because

00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,250
he cost kind of slow but his stuff is

00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:04,159
really good and he also keeps abreast of

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,930
all the stuff that's happening in the in

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,419
them and you know like this plug-in is

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,859
having a security issue or whatever he

00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,400
keeps up with all that keeps everybody

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:12,739
informed

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,060
I mean his Facebook there too okay

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:18,560
enough about here so I just I started

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,239
going to word camps and I started

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,370
hanging out with you know our

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,350
and I kept hearing people complaining

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,780
about the same things scope creep

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,580
getting content from the clients getting

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,280
the projects done on time within budget

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,750
and still having a happy client and

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,120
these are things that I learned how to

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,860
do in corporate IT and so I've got the

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,780
magic saucer all that so I thought well

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,639
why don't I put that together and start

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,759
sharing it with people

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,470
so that's part when I first launched WP

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,630
roadmaps and coaching it was about doing

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,570
what Adams doing but now it's about

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,630
real-life project management skills for

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:56,509
you guys because what I'm finding is and

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,250
it's nobody's fault it's just that you

00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:59,509
know you these small agencies are

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,919
forming and you've got this great

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:05,270
programmer and a talented designer and

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,280
they even know they even have really

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,630
good business skills but they nobody

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,520
ever taught them how to manage projects

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,400
and it's a skill it's not like a whole

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,220
discipline so you need to kind of it's

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,080
not something you can most people can't

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,949
really be successful at it just I'll

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,020
figure it out

00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:24,110
there are some tips and tricks to make

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,539
this stuff work ok so what I'm going to

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,820
tell you about today is the importance

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:31,760
of a project management methodology the

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,440
key elements of a project management

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,300
methodology and how to craft those key

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,699
elements and then how to use your

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,409
project management methodology as a

00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:42,680
unique value proposition when you're

00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:45,409
competing against other people now

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,180
here's the very most important thing if

00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:49,400
you want to leverage your project

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,349
management methodology the very first

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,520
thing is that you must actually have one

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:57,050
ok so how many people in here have a

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,370
written project management methodology

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,830
or development methodology that you

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:07,610
follow see about maybe one third of the

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:10,520
people in the room what a project

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,669
management methodology is is a set of

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,550
guiding principles and processes that

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,870
defines how you work and communicate and

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,550
it's important for your client to know

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,229
that up front and you need to know what

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,729
it is if it's not written down and you

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,889
have to discuss it with your team or

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,560
maybe it's just you you still need to

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,550
have this now let's make a distinction

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,490
here though

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,750
let me tell you why you need it first

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,110
random processes are going to always

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:39,140
result in project overruns which what

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,150
what does that do your RA eats it up but

00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,970
if you have repeatable processes that

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,860
increases your efficiency it allows you

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,480
to do more precise estimating you get

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,390
better over time you have a better

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,760
informed client there's a clearer

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,450
understanding by everyone the client you

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,040
and the team of the tasks ahead you end

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,200
up with higher quality clients because

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,780
you can shop for clients instead of

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,950
letting them shop for you and then sets

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,940
you apart from the competition and

00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,020
that's what we're going to really focus

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,530
on but I want to give you some

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,940
background first because you want to be

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,830
like this woman does anybody know who

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,180
this is

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:18,230
right does he buddy know what showed us

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,950
from very good do you know why Rita

00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:30,380
Moreno is so revered and feared at

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:33,830
auditions she's a triple threat she can

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:37,430
sing she can act and she can dance okay

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:40,220
so you want to be a wordpress triple

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,070
threat you may be a great designer of

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,540
websites you may be a builder developer

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,000
implementer of WordPress websites I'm

00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,230
never sure what to call that yeah if you

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,270
don't write code you can't really be a

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,810
developer but I'm developing websites so

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,520
anyway

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,350
I'm calling everyone WordPress

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,780
practitioners that sort of covers it

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,240
right okay and then the last thing is

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,040
being a manager of website projects this

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,170
makes you a triple threat and much more

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,640
marketable when you can prove to your

00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,740
client hey I know a lot more than IX

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,260
guys about getting these things done on

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,030
time but I want to make a quick

00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,820
distinction here because a design in

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,930
here Adam Silver no I listen to one of

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,100
his podcasts the other day he was

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,270
talking about project management

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,560
methodologies and how he's trying to

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,570
choose the one that was right for him

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,550
and he did some research but what I

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,020
noticed about his podcast and I did tell

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,490
him this in person I would not just say

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,410
this without talking to him first is

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,850
that he was calling all of these things

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,980
project management methodologies and

00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,680
they're not if anybody's out of

00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,680
corporate IT or any kind of formalized

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,700
IT you probably have heard of waterfall

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,800
waterfalls software development

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,769
lifecycle hey that's a development

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,419
methodology project project

00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,429
management methodology as I said before

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,889
is a set of guiding principles and

00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:50,649
processes that define how you work and

00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:52,059
communicate and here's some examples PMI

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,470
is anybody ever heard of this Institute

00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:55,300
the project management institute and

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,860
they have a book called the PMBOK which

00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,799
is the project managers book of

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,660
knowledge they're a pure project

00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,529
management methodology so is Six Sigma

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,480
and sei Cesc mm which is the software

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:09,790
engineering Institute's capability

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,970
maturity model those things those are

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,069
all project management methodologies but

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,139
a development methodology is a lifecycle

00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:19,119
for developing or maintaining a product

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,679
application or service so it's a little

00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:23,230
different and some examples of that are

00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,939
waterfall rad which is rapid application

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,939
development and then application

00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:30,819
maintenance just some examples but then

00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:32,410
there's the there's these methodologies

00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:35,379
that have combined the two and the most

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,850
popular being well these are where

00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,679
they're combined most popular being

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,299
agile

00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,799
those of you who have ever worked in a

00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,559
formal environment than you've heard of

00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,769
this and khandaan and scrum are both

00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,170
versions of agile they're not different

00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,730
they're different but they're people are

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,709
referring to these as three different

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,660
things and they're not because Kanban

00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,480
and scrum are first in subtitle just so

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,309
you can all be educated about that now

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,709
back in the day when I worked for keen

00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:06,459
which was a big software consulting firm

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:10,600
based in Boston John keen he was an old

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:12,879
IBM ER and he formed this consulting

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,290
firm and the project's kept running over

00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,209
time and over budget so he did what any

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,629
IBM er would do any hired a consultant

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:21,339
to come in and study that and out of

00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:22,480
that study came these are where the

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,309
bottlenecks are these are where the

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,720
problems are and he came up with the six

00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:28,089
principles for productivity management

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,220
for software development I've taken

00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:33,160
those same six principles and modified

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,540
them somewhat for WordPress so I'm just

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,589
going to go over these quickly and then

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,169
we'll get to the meat of what we're

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:40,689
talking about John King talked about

00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:42,369
defining the job in detail but what I've

00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:44,019
done is changed it to defining the dhaba

00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:45,579
job in detail of the content first

00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:49,360
approach how many were just in

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:50,949
Jennifer's talk okay so I have a

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,209
different viewpoint of content first

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,870
than Jennifer does so I'm just going to

00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,110
worry about

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,360
right up front I do wait until I have

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,910
all the content before I begin the work

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,380
and because I structure the payment

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,180
schedule so that I make sure I get paid

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,860
for that detailed discovery is that

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,400
that's a whole nother topic for another

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,620
day but the content first thing works

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,570
for me but she is right that you have to

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,520
judge that based on the size of your

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,330
client the technical expertise of your

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:22,300
client you have to nobody can give you a

00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,160
road map that is perfect for everything

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,750
you do you got to take that stuff and

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,600
then modify it for the specifics of your

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,710
client and your niche or whatever the

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,330
second things is getting the right

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,830
resources involved John Keane was

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,750
getting the right people involved but we

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,470
know there's a lot more resources to get

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:40,120
involved like plugins and blocks and

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,640
themes and things like that estimate the

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,990
time and cost but here it's estimating

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
the time and cost too often because

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,050
estimating is not just a one-time task

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,330
it's something you need to do across the

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:55,080
project break the job down this is where

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:59,410
John King was so if you what's the word

00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,540
he was very forward-looking he defined

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,090
something about agile before they even

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,880
knew that and that was the 80-hour rule

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,020
he had us have a deliverable every

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,700
eighty hours and then that might be a

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,410
little overkill for a wordpress project

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,540
but the point is break it down into

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,760
chunks and you have a deliverable every

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,610
so often so you always know exactly

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,230
where you are and it holds everybody

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,350
accountable and you know exactly where

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,940
you are in the project timeline now

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,500
everybody in this next to the last one

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,240
establish and stick to a change

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,790
procedure just about everybody's got a

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,980
change procedure problem is we don't

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,120
stick to it a lot of people you know

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,140
I'll just throw that in and you know

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,190
it's going to take too long to go

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,710
through the change procedure I'll just

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,350
you know that's what that's about

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,540
oops wait let me go back did you get the

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,480
last one establish interim and final

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,880
acceptance criteria a lot of people say

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,000
when the site is live we are done that

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,830
is not enough of acceptance criteria for

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,810
your client to sign off you've got to

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,490
have a lot more detail so that's that

00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,620
was what that principle is about and

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,360
doing it for the interim deliver rules

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,300
as well so there's never question has

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,400
anybody ever had

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,350
happen where you you know you've done

00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,910
exactly what you all agreed to and you

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,190
hand it to when they go oh wait that's

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,750
not what I asked for but it's not

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,640
written down what those check off items

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,200
are well if it meets these criterias

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,250
you're not allowed to say I don't want I

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,080
don't like it because you already agreed

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,730
that that's what was going to happen and

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,950
when you do that upfront it really does

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,770
save a lot of problems with scope creep

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,600
and things like that okay now on to the

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,400
elements of a good project management

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,740
methodology well the first thing it does

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,030
is it defines how you estimate the

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,470
project you need to share that with the

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,750
client how do you plan to come up with

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,980
this estimate and I'll tell you a minute

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,650
about the crystal ball approach and

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,640
where that does not work but that that

00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,710
needs to be a part of your project

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,570
management methodology proper and good

00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,430
estimating and have it documented how

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,380
you do that then let me go up on my

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,690
soapbox for one second stop calling it a

00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,580
quote a quote is when the man comes to

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,320
build a fence in your yard and he can

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,580
measure the front he knows exactly what

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,110
the materials are going to be he knows

00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,360
exactly how long it's going to take him

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,130
and he knows exactly how big it is but

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,540
unless you're doing a detailed discovery

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,430
in that first meeting with the client

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,010
that's just not true there's no way you

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,360
can so it's an estimate until you get

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,790
the detail and then you can give a more

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,070
precise estimate and there's also no

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,140
such thing as an accurate estimate you

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,560
see why because an estimate is an

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,670
estimate so it can't be accurate okay

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,230
and the next thing that you need to have

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,210
in your project management methodology

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,740
is how you're going to manage the

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,270
resources how do I know that you're

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,320
getting the right people involved how do

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,030
I know that you're getting the right

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,550
plugins involved how do I know that

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,980
you're using the proper theme you need

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,840
to have a method by which you determine

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,420
those things and you need to have that

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,520
written down you need a work breakdown

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,620
structure for your standard way you do

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,300
business it only takes one time of doing

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,850
this and you can reuse it over and over

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,520
and over and so does anybody know what I

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,300
mean by work breakdown structure

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,740
activities of phases activities tasks

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,720
because you need that in order to

00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,790
estimate properly a lot of times we just

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,050
kind of take a grab out of the air but

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,000
never works

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,290
you need an approach to content

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,390
collection are you going to use a

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,400
content first approach are you going to

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,200
do sprints where the content is the

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,840
deliverable at the end of that sprint or

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,560
80 hour rule or 120 hour rule or

00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,810
whatever you

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,339
disease so you need but you need to have

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,959
that documented and what's going to

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,089
happen when the client doesn't deliver

00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,620
the content are you gonna keep working

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,660
here's what usually happens

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,680
well they miss their deadline I'm just

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,819
gonna go ahead and finish the website

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,800
then when they get the content finished

00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:32,389
I'll just plug that in then they turn

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,949
you've done all this work for free

00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,809
because you only got that little deposit

00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:37,670
at the beginning so that's why that old

00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,079
way of doing things doesn't work and

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,670
I've got a lot of stuff on my website

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,379
I'll share with you in a minute

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,559
where you can get some more information

00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:48,019
on this but I have a content collection

00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,509
process that works because alway I also

00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,740
structure the payment schedule and then

00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:53,240
change management of course you've got

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,339
to have a really good change management

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,379
plan and acceptance management so

00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,180
there's six sections that you really

00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:01,399
must have in a good project management

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,019
methodology proper estimating resource

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,180
management work breakdown structure

00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,740
approach to content collection a change

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,730
management procedure and acceptance

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,209
management plan

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,910
any questions okay so let's dig a little

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:16,339
bit deeper into those things proper

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,050
estimating I think that's going to take

00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:20,930
us about ten hours but you know just be

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,339
safe again twelve that is the crystal

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,399
ball approach and it never works

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:27,110
especially because if you're doing this

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,019
estimate and trying to come up with a

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,879
precise estimate in your proposal you're

00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:34,129
most likely not going to hit the mark

00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,589
because there's no way after an hour and

00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,959
a half discovery meeting you can I use

00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:40,430
it I use a range in the proposal then I

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,439
do a more detailed statement of work

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,240
then I get a deposit that covers with me

00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:45,889
creating the statement of work then we

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,540
do a deep dive in a much more detailed

00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,850
statement of work I always give the

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,309
client the option to back out at that

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,829
point if the if the next quote excuse me

00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:56,720
estimate comes in too high

00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:58,730
higher than that at that range then I

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,959
give them a chance to back out but I

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,059
just hand them a statement of work they

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,529
already pay for it and I walk away that

00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:05,750
way everybody's happy at the end of that

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:08,839
right it's not any argument or anything

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,640
so why you should need to abandon the

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,829
crystal ball approach don't try and

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,299
estimate what you don't know so this

00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,459
needs to be part of your estimating

00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,079
process if you can convince a client

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,399
that you don't estimate what you don't

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,589
know and that's why we have to do this

00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:23,310
deep dive first so that I can find out

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,870
everything make sure that I've got your

00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,870
proper estimate they usually respect

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:30,450
that you want to get rid of the pad as

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:33,360
your method of change control and let me

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,670
tell you why you can't measure it

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,890
alright if I if I say this projects

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,290
gonna cost $5,000 and then you know me

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,370
and Johnny decide well let's put 20% on

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,770
top of that just in case we have

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,630
problems well that might happen and you

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,760
might eat that eat up that whole amount

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,160
that you added on top and you still come

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,920
out okay but you don't know which places

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,090
you messed up or which places the client

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,650
didn't give you what they needed there's

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,800
no way to have a lessons learned from

00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,480
that because it's an arbitrary number

00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,770
and you never tracked any of the stuff

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,130
that was that was that was caught that

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:10,290
you used out of that money now what I

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,690
never present never provide a precise

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,300
estimate in your proposal now what I use

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,620
is a change budget but I'll talk about

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,060
that when I talk about the change

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,220
procedure which is different than a pad

00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,860
and I'll explain why okay the next

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:33,590
section excuse me on my take a little

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:36,570
swig of water here okay I'll try math so

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,150
you need to define what your approach is

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,970
to getting the right people involved the

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:44,640
right plugins involved right hosting

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,500
involved the right blocks involved and

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:53,100
then other resources that you're going

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:54,750
to need so like for plugins most people

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,880
have a standard set of plugins that you

00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,310
like to use write up a description of

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,320
those you modify it based on the needs

00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,880
of the client and so that deliverables

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,470
pretty much done before you ever start

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,140
right you just have to tweak it each

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,570
time for each client or be open-minded

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,850
to a better plug-in coming along because

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:15,630
sometimes that doesn't you want to

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:20,390
switch let's see what else did I want to

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:22,500
tell you about this I think that's it

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,030
okay then you got your work breakdown

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,490
structure so I put a picture of the

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,310
waterfall here to indicate I use a

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:32,070
waterfall approach which all that means

00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,780
is that one phase activity or task leads

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,150
into the next one and into the next one

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,390
the output of one becomes the input to

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,740
the

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:44,370
next it also has milestones or breaking

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,200
things down into chunks the 80-hour rule

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,050
that we talked about or something

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,800
similar and a work breakdown structure

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:55,080
that uses incremental approvals if you

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,260
can get your client to approve the

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,030
design in little pieces then when you

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,580
get to the end of the project

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,290
there's nothing hardly left to approve

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,300
because they approved everything in

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,700
pieces you know that last section where

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,290
there have to approve the entire website

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,270
can sometimes drag your project to a

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,280
screeching halt but if you've got good

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,290
acceptance criteria defined up front and

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,630
then you use this incremental approval

00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,310
process it can really make things so

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,990
much nicer at the end so that you all go

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:25,470
have champagne together instead of going

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,000
oh I'm glad that's over and then which

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,250
approach to content collection are you

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,950
going to take which came first the kind

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,650
of chicken or the egg content or it's a

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,320
design most people talk about a Content

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,210
first design approach but I think it

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,760
goes deeper than that I think it is a

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,080
Content first development approach now

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,910
when I say I get I don't do any

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,410
development until the client gets me the

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,280
content I don't mean that I don't do a

00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:52,980
stitch at work I do some preparation I

00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,470
set up and I will I will install some

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,670
plugins especially if it's safe forms

00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,440
plug-in or something where I'm going to

00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,080
need to create a form to get them to

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,400
approve when I'm doing the design then

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,160
yeah I'll go ahead and set those things

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,490
up first but in terms of doing any real

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,100
design without having done them and

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,410
here's the other thing when you if you

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,600
do the content first stuff right and you

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,460
do a run track random order of magnitude

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
of the content before you ever start

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,550
like how many paragraphs are going to be

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,200
in each first you do your sitemap figure

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,880
out how what the pages are then you

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,380
figure out well how much content how

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,360
many texts how much text is going to be

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,340
on that page probably how many videos

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,800
how many pictures how many you know

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,660
whatever and you show that to the client

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,250
they will most if they were planning to

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,240
do the content and you don't really want

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,620
them to because you know it's going to

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,030
slow things down that will usually

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,410
convince them that it's too much work

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,390
for them that they need to get a third

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,250
party or if you offer that service that

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,450
you need to hire them to desire you to

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,640
do it it's a good selling point

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,580
sometimes when you show them what it

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,080
really looks like

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,850
in little bits and pieces okay so you in

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,830
this in this approach to your content

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,179
collection you need to define how you're

00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,409
going to determine the content

00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,510
requirements and here's the other thing

00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:06,340
a lot of times the approach we take is

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,690
okay well I'm gonna I'm gonna figure out

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,429
how many pages we need and everything

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,200
and I'm gonna figure out how much time

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:12,730
then you go and you know what content

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,720
needs to be on the pages so you go go

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:19,029
get it but we don't ever really devise

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,860
the requirements for the content and we

00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:22,600
don't ever estimate the content if we're

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,330
not the ones doing the work but I

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,250
contend that it's our job to estimate

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,289
the whole project even if the clients

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,019
doing that big chunk so that they get a

00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:33,820
real good sense of what that means and

00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,409
that's a lot of the problem with getting

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,940
the content from the client is they

00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:54,820
don't understand the magnitude of the

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:58,470
work yes sir you have a question oh and

00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:01,450
I try never to have the copywriter

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:04,840
contracted to the client the copywriter

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,039
should be contracted to you don't I mean

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,799
that's just how I've always done it

00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,059
because for that exact reason and you

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,529
just build that into the cost of the

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,250
project once you get the client to agree

00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,480
to it

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,340
and that way you get to work with

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,470
copywriters you think and y'all work

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,570
well together and that sort of thing

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,070
unless you vet that and that's an the

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,389
way you sell it to them is look I

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,740
already got a copywriter that can do

00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:27,630
this for you you don't need to go hire

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,630
anybody if that's the way you want go

00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:32,590
and your content collection approach

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,149
needs to set the proper expectations

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,710
with the client regarding content the

00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:38,590
magnitude of the work who's going to do

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,720
what and that sort of thing and then you

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,279
in this you got to describe how you're

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,659
going to manage those content collection

00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,250
activities whether you're going to do

00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:46,600
the content first approach and what your

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,470
what your expectations are from the

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,929
client change management okay we tend to

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,760
pretend like well you know if we're

00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:57,760
really good at what we do there will be

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,889
no change that's just dumb there is

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,310
going to be change on every project I

00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:02,590
don't care

00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:04,660
how small I don't care how I look I am a

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,100
fabulous business analyst I can do the

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,360
best business requirements and

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,370
functional requirements you've ever seen

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,870
but I've never had one project where

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,190
there wasn't something that slipped

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,100
through the cracks that showed up later

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,840
so acknowledge change as inevitable with

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
the client just be brutally honest with

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,050
them say look this is what happens on

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,640
almost all projects but I've got a

00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,130
process in place that's going to prevent

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,830
that so that's means that you plan for

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:28,390
change you manage the change you use a

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,850
change budget which I'll explain in a

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:34,330
second and you implement change control

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:36,880
these last two words without exception

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:41,280
no matter how small no matter how

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:45,220
whatever okay so the change budget

00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,710
$5,000 project I'm gonna take 20 to 30%

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,540
of that add it to it as a change budget

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,730
and then when I present my proposal to

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,620
the client I'm gonna say look this look

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,200
this bucket is sitting over here for you

00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,210
to use for changes that might occur

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,580
doesn't matter who comes up with the

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,990
change or whose fault it was that it

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,850
wasn't discovered earlier none of that

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,270
matters we're taking all the negativity

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,980
out of it but that should then when said

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,080
when a change comes up you felt you do

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,370
the change request somebody decides how

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,780
much impact it's going to have on the

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:16,120
cost how much impact it's going to have

00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,680
on the schedule and then the client gets

00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,870
to decide do I want to take that money

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,280
out and put it in the budget and if they

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:26,020
say yes go ahead and make the change

00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:28,240
boom invoice that way I make sure I get

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,860
paid for every single change now that's

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,720
not true I don't always invoice them

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,160
right immediately sometimes I'll wait to

00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,810
the next payment interval and I'll just

00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,580
add it to that payment interval that

00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,040
they were going to make anyway but the

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,350
point is don't do work without getting

00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,820
paid just to be nice because they'll

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,500
expect it the next time and the next

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,600
time in the next time I've done it I

00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,830
know it's terrible and then we just

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,840
thought we talked about acceptance

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,730
management and you need a formal process

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,290
of acceptance and by that I don't it

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,810
just needs to be a process everybody can

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,610
follow that's what formal means it needs

00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,290
to be incremental as I mentioned and you

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,490
need to define what the acceptance

00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:05,770
criteria is before the project begins so

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,840
why does any of this matter well let's

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,380
be honest guys WordPress is not that

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,309
hard

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:15,610
and you know one wordpress solution for

00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,990
an easy mom-and-pop website is generally

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,760
going to look pretty much the same as

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,860
the next guy right it's gonna have a

00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,049
theme it's gonna have some plugins it's

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,750
gonna have design elements maybe some

00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:28,450
custom CSS maybe a little coding but you

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,039
need something else to do that you can

00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,809
set that you can set yourself up as a

00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,640
unique value proposition so what do you

00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:35,590
how are you going to do that well if you

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,539
use a two-step proposal process like

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,390
mine it actually ends up saving money

00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:42,220
because if during the you give remember

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,980
you gave them a range in the proposal

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,870
and then during the deep dive is when

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,730
you get into the detail well if a change

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,280
comes up during that process and that

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,470
does not cause you to exceed the range

00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,330
that you gave them in the first place no

00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,370
change control you don't need to as part

00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,900
of the discovery process they're with

00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,059
you every step of the way so they've

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,440
never bought on anything because they

00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,169
were right there when the change was

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,150
discovered so doing if you do changes

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,820
during that phase where you're doing the

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:12,789
project definition zero dollars you do

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,620
it during development big dollars so it

00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:16,960
costs a lot more to do changes later on

00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,760
so this is how you set that up if you

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,070
can set if you've got a way to do this

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,120
then you say to your client you know

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,909
this is what makes me better than the

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,120
next guy we don't estimate what we don't

00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,679
know if you can tell your client we

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,539
don't pad estimates because we don't

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,490
have to and you show them how you did it

00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:35,679
and then the next guy he's gonna say to

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,690
the next guy how'd you come up with that

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,320
estimate it's gonna be a little more

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:43,809
educated we ensure we get the right

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,610
resources involved and you explain to

00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:47,590
him what your process is you know I've

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,419
got this copywriter on that's in the

00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,370
background here if we need them

00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:53,320
I have this standard set of plugins

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,240
these are these are you know plugins

00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,230
that are well respected and you know you

00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,720
don't want to go into too much technical

00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,100
detail but you get my point right is

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,110
you're just explaining to them the

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:06,190
process by which you're coming up with

00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,570
this then you do this the incremental

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,240
acceptance process that have always

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,039
misunderstanding because and here I'm

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,690
showing it as requirements you've gotten

00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,250
approval on then you got approval on the

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,809
content then you got to prove along the

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,900
plugins you got to prove on the layout

00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:21,030
and branding then when you get done

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,590
where you put it all together

00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,210
what are they gonna argue about nothing

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,200
business all just as you've already

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,140
gotten approved

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,410
unless there's a change we design around

00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,570
content which increases efficiency when

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,550
you discover additional content needs

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,010
once you're in development often that

00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:40,110
will affect the design and then you just

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:43,980
got a boatload of rework which is you

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:45,690
know the quintessential scope creep so

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,520
that's why we do the content first that

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,890
way we make sure our design is and is

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,660
headed in the right direction and we

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,070
acknowledge change we plan for it we let

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,840
you manage it and this is something I

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:57,330
wish everybody would would start doing

00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,300
is stop penalizing the client for change

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,190
as if it's their fault it's nobody's

00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,870
fault that this change occurred or that

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,790
they've decided now that they need this

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:07,050
new future or they I mean sometimes

00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,850
they're frivolous but the thing about

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,280
that change budget is you get a lot

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,320
fewer frivolous change requests but this

00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,580
is their money right they're not asking

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,440
you to take the money out of your Rock

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,600
ROI it's coming out of their change

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,860
budget there are a lot less you know if

00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,880
they say well we want all that you

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,490
remember when I told you I wanted all

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,510
those things read now I want to blue you

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,040
know if there's not a business

00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:29,700
requirement behind that you can usually

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,600
talk the client out of it by saying you

00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,640
know you're gonna have to take money out

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,050
of change budget oh you know the other

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,390
beauty thing about the change budget

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:39,930
it's magic you always come in under

00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:42,120
budget because you don't use the change

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,620
budget nobody you hardly ever if you if

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,150
you do that percentage correctly you

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,500
hardly ever use the change budget and

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,510
then that again the thing about

00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,760
estimating is the only way to get better

00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,200
at it is to keep doing it you know and

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,130
measuring yourself and figure out where

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,480
you made your mistakes and then

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,480
improving yes

00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,600
mm-hmm

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,139
correct and so in that utopia world

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,700
where you wouldn't have no changes you'd

00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:26,070
never touch that budget and it's never

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,860
real money it's just a budget you know

00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:31,130
but they've there but but it's possible

00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,019
that is possible that project could cost

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,309
$3,500 or even more if they exceed their

00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,130
change budget but I've never had that

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:41,279
happen as long as you put enough aside

00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,899
to begin with so we never penalize the

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,820
client for change it's not their fault

00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,840
they don't you know and that's it

00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,730
because they don't know how we do

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,620
business and we forget to educate them

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:58,769
on what what is involved in a website

00:30:49,620 --> 00:31:00,750
project yes no the question was have I

00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:07,200
ever tried to take the change budget up

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:08,580
front no no but that could be a good

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,330
incentive for getting the content done

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,130
on time and now I got five minutes ten

00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:19,620
thank you that's what two five Smith

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:24,149
thanks I think I'm close to being

00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,470
finished okay um yeah we just got to

00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:27,090
stop making the client feel bad for

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,159
coming up with changes and then you can

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,049
always position it as phase two item two

00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,779
first you evaluate the change to change

00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:36,149
control process and they go that's going

00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:37,230
to take six more weeks you know and they

00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:39,120
don't want to they don't want the time

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,340
extended so that so you just suggest

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,110
that it go into a phase two and we'll

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,399
we'll do that in another project and

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,740
then you'd go through the whole process

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,269
of estimating the project again the

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,669
other way you can incent your client to

00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:52,519
get you content on time is and this is

00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:55,710
this in this case a little pads okay

00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,940
maybe you add 500 to the total and then

00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,679
you tell the client you will give them a

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,720
$500 rebate if they get all their

00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,299
content done on time the main thing is

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,309
to make sure the client understands how

00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:06,960
big that job is and are they really

00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:08,580
prepared to do it and if and that's your

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,980
job to help them figure that out maybe

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,690
they are maybe they're not maybe you're

00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,899
not maybe you need to get that third

00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,309
party okay so how does this set you

00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,769
apart all right the other guy is not

00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:21,860
really a shark I just really liked that

00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:23,929
picture

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,029
but this is how it sets you apart from

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,010
the other guy you have a two-step

00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:30,260
estimating and proposal process if you

00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,909
were to copy what I do estimating an

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,190
approval process the other guy just

00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:37,309
attempts a precise estimate without a

00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:41,539
deep dive or detailed stuff because he's

00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:43,429
doing that crystal ball thing the

00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:45,830
functions actually do the end up

00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:47,000
function the ending functions actually

00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,299
do address the business requirements

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,710
which is the functions can and when the

00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:53,899
other guy doesn't the functions can't

00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,549
always be tied back to a business

00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:57,620
requirement because they just well we

00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:59,419
always do that because that's the way we

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,309
do all our clients like that you know

00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:04,789
that's not a requirement the client

00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:06,320
didn't ask for it content first on the

00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:09,320
other guy it's usually content

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,909
bottlenecks and project delays manage

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,740
change with a clock with the client in

00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:16,460
charge he has no plan for managing

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,769
change use a change budget pads the

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,750
quote to cover any unknowns and I'll

00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:22,510
have a link to these slides I'll give

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,220
you in a minute they're on my website

00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,320
precise acceptance criteria doesn't

00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,880
precisely define what done means and

00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,880
that's not just for the final project

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,260
but for each little piece and then you

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,399
you use proven product product Florida

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,409
proven productivity management

00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,850
techniques that may allow you to get

00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:43,580
your projects done on time within budget

00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:47,480
and with features that meet the clients

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:49,340
needs and he doesn't okay so here's the

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,750
kicker of once you've convinced the

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,080
client that you're like the project

00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:56,809
manager from heaven then you educate

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,399
them on what to ask the other guy okay

00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:00,590
which is what's really gonna set you

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,539
ahead of the game how did you arrive at

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,980
that estimate you want hit your guy to

00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:05,809
go ask that guy how did you arrive at

00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,760
estimate how do you discover and

00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:09,560
document the business requirements

00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,230
what's your process for that how do you

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,629
manage the content activities how do you

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:17,599
plan for and manage changes how is the

00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:19,399
cost for change determined what are the

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,440
criteria for approval of the project

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,149
what about interim deliverables and how

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,159
can we be sure that the project will be

00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:27,320
completed on time within budget and has

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,940
all the features we requested when you

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,649
school your client to ask those

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,510
questions in the next guy and the next

00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,310
guy can't answer them guess what you

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:38,659
just learned

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:41,120
so the key in summary is to try to

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,520
become a wordpress triple threat be a

00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,320
good designer be a good developer slash

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,440
implementer and be a good project

00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,360
manager and so you're going to do that

00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,790
with requirements discovery content

00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:56,390
activities change requests and scope

00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:58,820
creep deliverable approvals estimates

00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:03,290
and timelines client expectations and

00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:10,460
training so in summary you should be

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:12,800
like this not like this if you want some

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,390
more training information on different

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,720
pieces and parts of this I have three

00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:19,760
freebies on my website one is a tip

00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,880
sheet on six ways to control scope creep

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,590
in your in your proposal I have the free

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,660
lesson that's part of the content

00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,010
collection roadmap and then there's a

00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,270
little mini training on those six

00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,120
principles I was telling you about

00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,560
now that mini training uses a different

00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,540
name I was calling them the six

00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,550
principles of WordPress productivity and

00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,270
then I realize I can't use WordPress in

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,590
that manner it had to be for WordPress

00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:45,020
from you know the trademark thing and

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:46,640
then two of the things is I am them I do

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,750
administer the Facebook project

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,850
management group on Facebook I'm trying

00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,470
to get people more engaged but I do post

00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,150
some lives and some information there

00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,800
and the people that are in my group are

00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,780
gonna get special discounts as we move

00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,310
forward and I'm creating some more stuff

00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,480
that I that I would love to tell you

00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:05,690
about but I'm not allowed to tell from

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,150
the stage okay no I'll tell you about

00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,160
later they're not it's not ready anyway

00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,660
but it's a lot a lot of pieces and parts

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,640
of this that will help you get that job

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:18,170
done the other thing is the admin bar

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,240
Facebook group which I'm only a member

00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:23,210
of but I am in love with these guys they

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,380
they really Adams been interviewed by

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,210
the admin bar right yes they they're

00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,590
very laid back and they're focusing

00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,240
there both of them came out of different

00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,920
in other industries one was graphic

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,160
designer can't remember what Matt was

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,850
but they came together and they do this

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,800
they do a podcast live in the Facebook

00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,420
group and there's a lot of engagement

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,170
there are a lot of people helping people

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,060
with more of the business

00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,560
item you know what tool do you use for

00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,330
that because listen a project management

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,840
tool is never gonna solve this problem

00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:57,250
for you okay it'll help you plug

00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,990
everything into the little boxes but

00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,340
it's not gonna solve the problem so they

00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,620
go over a lot of that stuff about which

00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,450
tool to use for this and you know how do

00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,000
you do a funnel if you how do you do a

00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:09,280
funnel if you actually are a you know a

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,550
software developer or a wordpress agency

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,430
so I really recommend both those things

00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:20,380
my slides are available WP roadmap comma

00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:22,360
forward slash word camp and I am at WP

00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,280
roadmaps just about everywhere and I

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,280
would love some social media love if you

00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,870
liked what you heard here today and then

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,340
if you want to skip all those freebies

00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:32,230
but you want to know about this big

00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,970
thing I got coming out soon that's

00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,890
probably going to help you a lot then

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,840
you can just text read maps two four

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:46,570
four four nine nine nine and you'll be

00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:49,150
on my email us instantly I guess I

00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:51,490
should put that back up there so did you

00:37:49,150 --> 00:38:18,310
find that helpful does anybody have any

00:37:51,490 --> 00:38:21,010
questions yes well that's why if you

00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:23,770
make it as part of as you make if you

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:26,170
make it as the first activity and your

00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,640
deposit covers that activity so they

00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,980
don't feel like they're paying for it

00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,020
and then at the end of that deep dive if

00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,550
what you cut the new estimate that you

00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,130
come out with at the end of the deep

00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:37,000
dive exceeds the first one you just hand

00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,530
them the statement of work it's like

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,940
don't get the guy a type work to do it I

00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:47,230
don't care that's part of the deposit

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,810
sometimes my deposits for more than 50%

00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,430
if it's a big complicated thing like

00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,290
when I had to when I had to take a

00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,430
Weebly site and an old WordPress site

00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,730
and put them together and then add

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,780
membership functionality and I mean it

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,090
just went on and on and on

00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,590
that one I got a big deposit up front

00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:09,940
cuz I knew that discovery was gonna take

00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:11,710
us a long time yes I usually use twenty

00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,180
to thirty percent sometimes it depends

00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,910
on the client you know sometimes you

00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,770
just got to be kind of intuitive well

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,150
you got to be intuitive about all right

00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,690
they're never gonna get this done I'm

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:24,220
making it 40 percent you know or this is

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,810
somebody who worked with before you know

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,100
they're easy you know you can you need

00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,900
work to them so you say I'm just going

00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,730
to put 20% over there really doesn't

00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,230
matter because if you Vic see if you

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,820
exceed it then you have a meeting with

00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,580
the client and show them why it was

00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:48,010
exceeded and we need to replenish it as

00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:50,080
we go forward well know changing a word

00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,520
that's not exactly what I mean but any

00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,610
change that's going to change the

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,500
timeline the cost or the resources even

00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,510
if changing a resource doesn't change

00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,270
the time or cost it's still a change

00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,440
that needs to be documented and you know

00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,140
I'm a big believer in the project

00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,580
notebook - you do one for each one then

00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,900
you before you do the next project you

00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,250
go back to your project notebook can you

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,500
like oh yeah remember when we that

00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,430
happened look we can't remember stuff I

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,830
can't remember what I had for dinner

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,420
last night so you know trying to

00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,490
remember the last time I work for this

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,900
client or what did we write down six

00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:24,610
weeks ago that's why that project

00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,090
notebook is such a good resource I'm

00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:33,580
sorry

00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:36,610
oh yeah bugs are your fault yes uh-huh

00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,230
oh the 80-hour rule is like an agile

00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,260
sprint are you familiar with agile a

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,820
little bit yeah okay so all that means

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,680
is that you have a deliverable every 80

00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,630
hours or that was what we did in

00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,220
software development but the project was

00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,620
going to last a year and a half okay so

00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:53,320
in your case you might say okay I'm

00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:55,630
going to do it you know different

00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,300
intervals in your project plan that you

00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,890
have a deliverable there's a sign-off

00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,900
everybody and then that feeds into the

00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:04,450
next section and you know that's already

00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,890
approved right so that's why we have

00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,540
that 80 hour rule because you never get

00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,640
off more than two weeks if you use 80

00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,329
hours or two you know two weeks of

00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,599
man-hours

00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:28,719
Yeah right okay my pleasure

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:30,999
yes here's what I suggest

00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,499
join the admin bar Facebook group those

00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:36,009
are exactly the kind of things they talk

00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:38,579
about on the on the business side of

00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:40,779
what the different tools they use and

00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,349
it's not just those two guys but the

00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:47,439
