Publication date: 2019-05-14
Playlist: WordCamp Orange County 2019
Description: 
	In my session I will be exploring several ways to create a cohesive branding strategy, by delving into posting schedules, content strategies, relevant social media (what you actually need), and more. By the end we will all have (hopefully) learned something about what the current web users consider important, and what actually attracts your targeted audience.

[Applause]

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,920
I'm so happy to be here today I do want

00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,930
to preface my talk just by saying all of

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,090
this information in my talk can be found

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,500
on the Internet yes I learned some in

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,480
school but it's all on the Internet

00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,170
super easy to learn I'm just a vessel of

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,790
information for you all so let's get

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,940
started let's see so my talk is called

00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,200
the content creation and synergy

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,390
planning ahead is the only way to

00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:06,100
cultivate your brand so let me tell you

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:10,210
how you do that so when I was 13 I made

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,729
a face book and I posted pictures like

00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,950
that as they were edited on PicMonkey I

00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,479
believe it was called and it was just a

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,120
casual day with friends and then when I

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,520
was 14 or 15 I got an Instagram and that

00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,570
was my first Instagram caption gotten

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,180
our Instagram so I've learned a lot

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:34,570
since then and I'm happy to show you

00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,960
what I've learned um let's see so there

00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,290
we go

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,840
right consistency is key so I want to

00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,909
tell you all today about how succeeding

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,909
in the tumultuous world of social media

00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:49,720
is all started by rooting in a young

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:51,130
audience and by being consistent if

00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,220
you're not consistent your audience

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:57,670
won't know what to expect and they just

00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,159
won't have the energy to follow you all

00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,250
right let's see so first off I want to

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,420
start with a brain teaser I read a study

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:10,149
recently and it talked about how why

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,029
meme culture has everyone familiar with

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,760
the phrase main culture okay perfect so

00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:17,910
mean culture

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,000
why why is name culture so prevalent

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,459
today why is this a weird random sense

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,500
of humor such a big thing that sparked

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,569
such joy and people on the Internet

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,370
today

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,370
does anyone have any theories or guesses

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,410
yeah that's part of it when we get to

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,080
the end of my talk we're gonna find out

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:47,870
what this study hypothesized and found

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,230
so we'll get to that soon all right oh

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,860
there we go

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:55,739
all right so how many of you have a

00:02:52,860 --> 00:03:01,380
Facebook how many of you have an

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:03,620
Instagram Twitter Linkedin Pinterest

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:09,090
pretty much everybody has all of these

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:12,000
five main social media channels and what

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:16,560
I found is that people respond better to

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,920
visual forms of social media because we

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:25,410
are a visual society you know we people

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,269
use visuals even when they are putting

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,060
captions on other visuals they use

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,400
little emojis these little graphics and

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,380
we found a way to even make little tiny

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,150
videos that take one or two seconds the

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:42,030
gifts or jiff whichever way you

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:46,739
pronounce it so even the cavemen drew on

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:48,959
walls even the Egyptians drew on walls

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,040
people have been using visual aids since

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,739
forever

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,600
it's no secret even in Facebook's early

00:03:52,739 --> 00:04:00,480
days modern cavemen drew on walls

00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,370
Facebook walls and then yeah so visual

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,420
media is the key to reaching your

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,420
relevant audience well then sorry

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,010
there we go trying to figure out my

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,290
notecards perfect okay

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:23,329
so visual media is the key to reaching

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,329
your relevant audience so you need to be

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,550
hold on one second you guys sorry

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,370
perfect yeah you can't just use your

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,560
social media and your visual media as an

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,810
accessory to the content you already

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,419
have on your website you need to be able

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,330
to use each social media channel right

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,820
and use it effectively or else it will

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,470
just be something that you have you know

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,640
you need to put it in accordance with

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,570
your website and your other branding and

00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:02,390
it will work out best for you so what do

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:05,460
I need let me tell you you need Facebook

00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:09,360
so Facebook is a vital tool in social

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,220
media marketing because it everyone has

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,650
it everyone has a Facebook even if they

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,450
just use it to connect with highschool

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:20,340
frenemies you know everyone has a

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:22,530
Facebook you can use it too oh well

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:29,120
here's the problem with Facebook so

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:31,290
Facebook has some controversy with

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,140
hacking risks

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,640
there's cluttered news feeds people like

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,710
I said they use it to keep track of

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,760
their friends mostly but it's really

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,860
important to have your business on

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,919
Facebook so Facebook is a vital tool in

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,380
social media marketing it helps you

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,740

ads with ads manager and it keeps your

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,860

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,400
works really well for promoting your

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,460

when you need so Instagram has

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:45,759
revolutionized the way we communicate on

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,460
social media and let me tell you how so

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,600

out that didn't used to be a thing um it

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,199
would have taken I think I don't know

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,610
how long old cameras used to take but it

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,520
was taken along a long longer time it's

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,000
created a new type of brand strategy so

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,360
people share they do spotlights comments

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,150
and likes are worth a lot it's created a

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,630
new type of brick oh I already said that

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:28,599
okay mobilized its mobilized activism if

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,690

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:04,210
it's created the influencer and the

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:06,009
influencer has kind of turned into a job

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,840
it has turned into a job social media

00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:11,800
Instagram has turned into a type of

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:16,389
currency where you can companies will

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,240

that people can get real-time access

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,250
into the behind-the-scenes of your brand

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,980
you want to post at least one to two

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,840
times a day and so that people will see

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,360
that you're consistent and that you have

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,330
goals and are moving your business

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,040
forward or your brand forward you don't

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:05,070
want to post too much because it's

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:09,490
really easy to follow someone but it's

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:12,100
mmm well it's how do I explain this it's

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,780
it's really easy to follow someone but

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,130
it's just as easy to unfollow someone if

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,750
you would annoy someone on the internet

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,270
they will just go on to follow you right

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,450
away you know because we don't have the

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,730
patience to be scrolling for days you

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,400
know all right and you want to have a

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,810
theme because we are as we establish a

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,670
visual society so we want when people go

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,430
to your profile or your page they want

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,800
to see consistency in your theme they

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,260
want to see colors that match they want

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,930
to see good photography good layouts and

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:49,090
they want to see good infographics all

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:51,790
right Twitter so twitter has 310 million

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,480
users and a hundred million of those are

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,160
daily active views which is crazy to me

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,180
not that crazy because I often use

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,740
Twitter daily as well so yep Twitter is

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,080
a sentient professional social network

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,310
you've you will find a corporate you'll

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,140
find corporate professionals from

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,440
various industries as well as people who

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,210
are just there for entertainment so

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,970
social marketing professionals for my

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,710
industry could market their products on

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,990
Twitter also with their word limit

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,930
Twitter allows its users to be exposed

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,840
to clean and crisp ads from advertisers

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,430
without populating the feed this is just

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,180
a testimonial I found on the internet

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,830
that somebody was sharing their thoughts

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,080
about why they use Twitter and I thought

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,850
it was really relevant to what I'm

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,620
talking about today so just to reiterate

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,180
the word restrictions highlight the

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,440
important part of a message so that

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,700
works to your favor it might not seem

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,720
sometimes when you need to get

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,700
information out there but Twitter is

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,300
kind of like an RSS feed where you just

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,640
like scroll and you get the you know the

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,910
Daily News you see what your friends are

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:02,380
up to you see what Jen Miller and need

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:05,480
someone to blog is doing you know and

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,000
it's just a quick social media but it's

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,910
very important to have so that because

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,980
everyone is on Twitter everyone hashtags

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,660
are also very important because you can

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,030
search using your hashtags you can do

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,580
that with most social medias but Twitter

00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:22,970
there are hash tag algorithm is actually

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:27,250
I find it superior to other social

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:30,650
marketing industries because it helps

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,180
organize everything so if you have let's

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,790
see if you're doing a marketing campaign

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,050
you want to put a hashtag so that people

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,440
when they search that hash tag they'll

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:42,170
just get all of the information when on

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,180
those search results so and it's also

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,330
easy to reach out to people in brands

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,460
that has a immediate sort of interaction

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,820
capability that Instagram and Facebook

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:57,680
don't even have you know you have likes

00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:01,430
retweets and you can quote the retweet

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,560
you know you know how Titor works let's

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,810
see and the outliers that I have our

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,640
Instagram and Pinterest the only reason

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,130
why I call these the outliers is because

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,050
I don't use them as often for social

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,030
media marketing but they are very very

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:19,060
valuable and I need to start practicing

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:23,120
with our preach basically so LinkedIn

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:25,400
LinkedIn is really valuable because it's

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,839
very it's it's a professional

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,450
environment people don't use it for

00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,970
scrolling they don't use it much for you

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,500
know Facebook funny videos America's

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,720
Funniest Home Videos you know they don't

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,510
use it for that much what you want to do

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,190
with LinkedIn is have two profiles one

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,140
for you and one for your company or your

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:47,560
brand because it just separates it and

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:51,260
it makes you more marketable and more

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,510
what's the word I'm looking for more it

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,260
gives people a personal connection to

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,270
you I think in your brand

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,780
so you can do that by just making a

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:03,180
personal page and company page you want

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,720
to have a specific advertising or

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,710
marketing goal so that people know what

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,540
you're about when they go to your page

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,070
they don't want to scroll down and see

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:18,780
oh she likes photography she likes

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:20,610
dancing she likes writing poems you know

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,920
she they don't want to see your hobbies

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,070
they want to see why you're on LinkedIn

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,410
and what you have to share with them

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,170
LinkedIn is special because you can

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,210
optimize your company page so you can

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:38,160
optimize within LinkedIn so that your

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:39,840
pages come up for other peoples and it's

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,960
all on the back end it's very easy to do

00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,750
visual content

00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,970
it supports visual content of course all

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,160
social media channels support visual

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,980
content that I'm talking about today but

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,030
you want to put the visual content first

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:59,790
and forward so that you can grab your

00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:02,520
audience's attention and give them what

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:07,320
they're looking for and ads you can also

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:10,580
monetize or monetize slash optimize ads

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,930
on Facebook because sorry on LinkedIn

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,640
and that helps a lot because that also

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,750
helps with your SEO with your company

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,450
page and your personal page all right

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,390
now Pinterest Pinterest I love Pinterest

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,830
as anybody else love Pinterest so much I

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,470
squirrel princess Pinterest for days

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,760
mostly personal use but you know it's

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,940
still important to marketing in social

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,950
media so I found this really cool quote

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,050
on the internet photos our center stage

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,560
and sharing is second nature on

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,720
Pinterest when you go through it's all

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,820
right there you literally just have to

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,120
tap and you have five options

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,490
it takes three clicks really so

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:58,110
Pinterest highlights the trends which is

00:14:50,490 --> 00:15:00,360
really important it it gives like a

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,780
one-stop shop look into what people are

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,850
looking for what what is popular in

00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:08,069
audiences today

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,600
and we see this and Target in Nordstrom

00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:11,639
if you've ever been to Target or

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,500
Nordstrom they have little tags that

00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,810
they put on items that have been doing

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:21,360
well on Pinterest so they're used in a

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:23,190
real-world way to promote the company's

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,759
social media which something you could

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,980
do as well

00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,300
Lowe's uses it to show products in

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:35,190
action so they use the storytelling

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:41,009
principle they use let's see they they

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:42,509
take a bench and they do a project with

00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:44,100
it and then they post the project on

00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:48,420
Pinterest and they get people to follow

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:53,040
along with that and that is just another

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:55,769
way to get people to see what you can do

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,720
and follow your branding let's see if

00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:02,279
you were a paper company let's see how

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,889
would you personalize your product you

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,810
would put on Pinterest let's see this is

00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:10,410
how you make an origami rabbit this is

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,300
how you make a little cutout to put on

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,880
your wall this is you can make homemade

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,420
cards you know it's using it in a real

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,329
world example humanizes your brand and

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,310
makes it more easy to relate to and

00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:27,029
there is a unique opportunity on

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:29,100
Pinterest accumulate ice ed how do I

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,740
keep track of all of these social media

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:36,540
channels it's very difficult there's a

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,100
lot and it requires a lot of time you

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,939
don't want to use too many you'll get

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,189
burnt out

00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:44,459
you'll spend revenue and time on social

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:46,290
media channels that don't apply to you

00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:50,069
so what you want to do is either hire

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:55,620
social media manager or be a social CEO

00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:57,509
so as we approach business more casually

00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,839
and more transparently it's becoming

00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:03,839
more and more prevalent in business to

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,689
be a social CEO or be in control of your

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,449
own social media humanizes your branding

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:11,610
which is something I obviously love to

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:17,010
talk about I keep saying it

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:17,970
and it makes you more relatable on your

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,730
social media channels

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:25,110
so take Elon Musk for example he is the

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:28,350
CEO of Tesla I believe and these are

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:33,290
some of his tweets just highlighting you

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:41,030
know Tesla they got 100% crash rating

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:43,559
they hey they have it available for

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:47,840
renting you know he's just promoting his

00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:50,130
branding right now but oh there we go

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,809
and this is him stone in his kitchen on

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,650
a Friday night you know like he does

00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:58,080
both ways he does he does the branding

00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:01,950
part of it and he does his own personal

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,580
touch to his branding and he's gone from

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,900
in 2011 they made zero cars and five in

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:12,840
2019 they made five hundred thousand so

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:17,910
that has some pretty intense growth yep

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:20,460
so Tesla and Elon Musk he's a good

00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:24,360
social CEO to look up to he's not the

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,640
most perfect example just because he

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,770
does have a separate Tesla Twitter and

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,940
his own personal Twitter but he is a

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:34,410
great example of a social CEO people

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:39,390
know him they know his brand they know

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:43,040
them together let's see so cohesive how

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:46,400
do I make all of my branding cohesive

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,340
Tesla for Elon Musk and Tesla they use a

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,890
mix of mean culture of science and just

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,100
randomness but you want to find your

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:59,100
theme your voice and your posting

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,309
schedule so your theme will be your

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,929
visuals in your style just your overall

00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:06,059
branding style your voice will be your

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,470
tone and persona that's why it's

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,730
important to have one social media

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:13,770
person because it makes it easier to

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:17,190
make a voice - it sounds like it's all

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:19,380
coming from the same person and the

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,490
posting schedule it's important to stay

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,510
consistent in that because your audience

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,100
expects

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,540
if you don't have anything to deliver

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,830
then it won't work out as well

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,340
let's see so let's talk about posting

00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:37,950
schedules and content calendars social

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:42,830
media and website content need to work

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:45,420
together to keep you accountable to your

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:49,710
social to your branding and your

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:54,290
marketing and it's easier to engage it's

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,290
easier to reach your clients and your

00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,900
coworkers you're just peers in general

00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,940
you want to keep web content and socials

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,310
working together so that they benefit

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,220
you the most so your social media is

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,380
going to engage larger audiences it's

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,850
going to give you an online persona

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,280
which is very important today and it's

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,800
going to give you active marketing

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,960
results if you have a business Instagram

00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,550
you can literally look at your insights

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,400
right away right after you post

00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:25,500
something you can see what percentage of

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,350
them is male or female you can see what

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,690
age groups they are it's really cool and

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,550
website content is going to provide the

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,530
meat of your brand it's going to direct

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,680
people to your site and tell you and

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,920
tell them what you do it's going to get

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,240
you serious clients who will probably

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,940
give you your money if you're nice

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,400
enough to them and it helps with SEO

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,060
which is search engine optimization I'm

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,560
sure you know that but so social media

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,570
actually helps with SEO as well but

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,760
website content by nesting and Google

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,600
and everything yeah nesting and Google

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,760
it helps a lot and bring your

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,190
information up on the search engines so

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,420
here are some content calendar tips as

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,920
well because we want the social media we

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,510
want the website content but we have to

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,060
keep it consistent and that takes

00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,330
planning you want to have a rough

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:20,070
outline of posts photos and articles or

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,940
written pieces thought-out and ready to

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:26,100
go one to three months in advance I find

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,320
I mean I find it it's different for

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,510
everybody some people prefer one month

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,840
some people prefer a year you know it

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:36,390
depends on how often you change up your

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,430
style or how often

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,050
what kind of branding you have so you

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,260
want to use an online calendar or

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,940
planning service like Google suite or

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,160
some WordPress content planning tools if

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,650
you use a wordpress site so here are

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,450
some that I found I have used Trello I

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,490
haven't used co scheduled or published

00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:57,330
press but they look amazing and people

00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:00,030
really like them so Trello is free and

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,970
it has different boards to outline the

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:05,430
tasks the plug-in just displays

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:09,210
everything and it organizes everything

00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:12,150
into whatever categories that you put

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,890
them into it is just a great plugin

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:17,190
which is something you want if you have

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:20,250
a wordpress site everything is on the

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,500
front end with Trello so it's a little

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,100
bit of a learning curve but it's pretty

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,080
easy to use once you get there so with

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,720
Co schedule it's great for social

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,760
content specifically it's better for

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,410
establish earning sites simply because

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:39,120
it is costly and there is quite a lot

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:42,780
you can do with it so you want to be

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,110
able to fill out all of the areas of

00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,890
coastal if you're going to use them and

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:51,210
it has automated social media so it's

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:54,750
perfect for the social content and

00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:57,540
publish press is free it gives you full

00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:04,950
control and a great UI experience user

00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:08,310
interface there we go and it it's just

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:13,110
backend control very easy to use great

00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:14,930
user and experience and you can add

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:18,090
people onto projects which is something

00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,880
really valuable if you're using it for a

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:23,540
web building business or a business

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,060
that's larger and has a lot of employees

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,640
the free plugin offers enough for any

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,130
social marketing person so it's but you

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,790
can pay to integrate other plugins like

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:39,660
blue commerce and things like that

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:42,030
alright another tip is to use an app

00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,890
like preview.i that's just the one I

00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,430
personally is but you can watch your

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,700
brand theme

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:52,000
preview is used specifically for

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,290
Instagram it it just lays out your

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,880
Instagram and you can write your

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,430
captions and schedule when you're going

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,850
to post it I find it really useful to

00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,460
use because you want original content

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:06,310
and you want you just want it to be

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,930
cohesive and nice you want to have blog

00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,910
posts ready to publish and link and

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,340
corresponding social media posts so you

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:15,600
don't want to just put a post out about

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:19,780
your lunch and then say oh look at this

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,780
Web site article I did on how social

00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:27,000
media marketing is great in the world

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:29,080
today you know you want to be able to

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,370
have them be relevant to what you're

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,100
posting or people will just be like

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,350
she's fishing for whatever it helps with

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,060
search engine optimization and website

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,690
engagement as well because people can

00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,640
click on these links and go directly to

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,620
your website I was having a conversation

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,960
with someone yesterday about this though

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,220
and one thing you don't want to do one

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,010
thing that I don't like personally is

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,960
the link in bio business because that

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:56,230
change is so often you want to find a

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,250
way to include your link in your post so

00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,650
that people don't have to go to your

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:03,790
profile to click on you to click on your

00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:07,870
link you want to use relevant and proven

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:10,930
hashtags I say proven it's just if you

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,510
search it has a lot of hits and it is

00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,680
used a lot so people you know people are

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,480
searching it people are using this

00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,420
hashtag and trying to see what people

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,280
post with it and you want to plan with

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,840
original content so when you're planning

00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,390
if you're doing one to three months in

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,860
advance you want to be able to have all

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:31,390
of those visuals ready before you put

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,610
them on your plant you want to make sure

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:37,060
that you don't want to get to the day of

00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:38,200
and be like oh no we have this post that

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,210
we're gonna do and we don't have the

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,780
visuals for it that's never a good idea

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:47,170
it's how can you set yourself apart with

00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,970
your visual content you want to know

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,370
when to post as well but you can't take

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:54,280
it too seriously it doesn't matter too

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:57,360
much but it is good to know if you are

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,000
looking to get the most accurate

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,090
marketing

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,270
um feedback from Instagram from Twitter

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,310
from Facebook so the best posting times

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:15,860
are Facebook

00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:18,400
9 a.m. yeah let's see so Facebook is 9

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:22,540
a.m. so Facebook's super popular in the

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,550
industry a business you know so lunch

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:30,100
morning commute 3 to 4 p.m. they're

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:32,300
great and to post then because people

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,260
are scrolling through their Facebook

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,700
when they should be working and it's the

00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,820
best time to post on Facebook is

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,030
Thursday through Sunday Instagram 1 to 5

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,860
p.m. because that's right in lunch hours

00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:49,100
and it's right when work is over

00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:51,230
Instagram is a little it's a little more

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,810
browsable than Facebook but Facebook is

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,720
sometimes more interesting to people the

00:26:53,810 --> 00:27:00,650
browser in the day Twitter is like an

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,660
RSS feed like I said and so it's easy to

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,090
scroll so a lot of people are scrolling

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,150
while they're driving HSN I am in 6 to 9

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:11,090
p.m. during morning traffic during night

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,530
traffic just some commuting hours days

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,120
to post on Twitter depend on your

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,270
business and what you're selling if

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,250
you're selling something like

00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,870
photography services that you would

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,240
probably want to post on the weekend so

00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,650
that people could see it but really

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,300
posting on posting days on Twitter don't

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,240
matter as much

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,560
LinkedIn 25% of adults use LinkedIn

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,360
during work hours which makes sense

00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:38,210
because it's more of a professional sort

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,380
of social media channel but it said here

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:44,450
in my research that 10:00 to 12:00 p.m.

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:48,950
is when LinkedIn gets the most like

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:51,730
scrolling so it is beneficial to know

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,200
that just so if you're doing

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,420
interactions on Don and Linkedin you

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,570
know when you're going to get the most

00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,490
out of it and Wednesday is the best day

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:04,400
of post on LinkedIn and Pinterest is

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:07,310
heavily female it's 29 percent active

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,230
users which is great for a social media

00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,720
channel and it's a little less browsable

00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:14,320
so people don't

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,930
really view it until 8 to 11 p.m. when

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,820
you know moms who are doing DIY projects

00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:22,450
are going to bed yeah or putting the

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,130
kids to bed so let's see so that's where

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,320
and that you should post how do you make

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,690

a priority and make sure that it works

00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,610
for you and it's not just something

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,560

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,670
all right and here's my brain teaser

00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,670
okay so the let's see

00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:02,470
okay well here's the answer to the

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,770
brainteaser you guys so so the reason

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:10,530
why meme culture the random sense of

00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,530
humor you know is so prevalent and so

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:16,510
popular today is because we have the

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,840
world at our fingertips

00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:21,850
right in our phones we have all the

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,800
visuals all the words we're just

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,780
scrolling for days you know we've seen

00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,220
every word in the English language

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:32,320
probably since social media came out so

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,840
so because we've seen so many words and

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,510
content and such like a compounded

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,000
amount of time the only way that our

00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:44,170
brains are stimulated and it's not the

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,420
only way obviously but pop a way that

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,520
our brains are certainly stimulated is

00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,650
by content and words that are strung

00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,340
together that don't usually get strung

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:56,650
together so things like the skittles

00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,950
commercials you know that's pretty weird

00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:01,000
the Old Spice commercials and the

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,800
Superbowl commercial with the

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,990
puppymonkeybaby did anybody see that a

00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,040
couple of years ago super weird

00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:10,510
I did not get it but whatever so yeah

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:15,130
you just need to be aware of the trends

00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:17,500
and be able to see what kind of socials

00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,240
people are responding to and that seems

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,990
to be the weird randomness right now

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,910
so have fun with that and you want to be

00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,030
consistently on tread like I said and

00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:30,970
that will just help you gain a loyal

00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:34,980
audience if you ruin a younger audience

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:38,140
and you try really hard to stay on trend

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,840
engage them then they will grow with you

00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,900
and you'll be able to be successful in

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,400
your branding and marketing strategy and

00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,490
you want to be ahead of the curve with

00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,500
that so I would start now consistent

00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,390
planning and using relevant social media

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,820
will help you stay ahead of the curve so

00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,010
you need to be planning you need to be

00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,580
aware of what your next steps are at all

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,270
times

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:04,150
and that is it so these are my I'm

00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,290
that's my Twitter and that's my email if

00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,360
you want to

00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,580
this more but thank you so much for

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:16,240
coming to my talk you guys that's it

00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:17,800
thank you any questions I will take a

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:39,790
selfie and I'll put out my Instagram

00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:41,440
stories let's see okay perfect yes if

00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:46,030
you want to follow the trends so on

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,190
Facebook sharing articles is really

00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,510
important on Facebook right now I'm just

00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,100
pulling this out the top of my head like

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,240
I said I found this all from the

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,220
internet I'm just a vessel of

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,800
information so if anybody has any other

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,680
feedback I would be open to hearing it

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:03,400
as well but Facebook you want to share

00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:06,100
you want to have visual media of course

00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:09,220
you want to share pictures you want to

00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,440
put a very heavy importance on your

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,050
visuals so on your pictures you want to

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,700
have flat laser huge right now flat

00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:20,650
lathes are big let's see

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,060
you just want to include one of the

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,220
trends that I've been saying recently is

00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,480
like I said the social CEO you want to

00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,190
include the behind-the-scenes and you

00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,810
want to you want people to feel

00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:35,290
connected to your brand in a personal

00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:37,860
way essentially yeah yes yeah definitely

00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:41,730
you want to comment and engage mm-hmm

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,730
anything else yeah

00:33:48,490 --> 00:34:05,630
yeah you're right right right right

00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:08,720
let's see well I don't know does anyone

00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:31,100
have a solution to that anybody have any

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:33,200
ideas yeah very yeah exactly what what

00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,179
your target audience is maybe pick that

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,330
time stone if that has a time zone and

00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:40,429
if not then just you know you don't take

00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,080
it too seriously the times people will

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,110
see your posts because a lot Instagram

00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,760
Facebook I don't know

00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,649
Pinterest I think they're not

00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,419
chronological so it doesn't matter as

00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:54,580
much it's just like when people are on

00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:54,580
and interacting with the with the site

00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:02,680
yeah for sure

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:14,510
Instagram yeah so Instagram you want to

00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,700
post one to two times a day but you want

00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,590
to keep your stories active so but you

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:22,490
don't want to be too active you know you

00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,930
want maybe your main posts which is the

00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,490
most important part you want one to two

00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:27,230
times a day any more than that and

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,220
people will be like whoa she's spamming

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,220
my newsfeed you know

00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:39,460
oh of course yes sorry about that

00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:43,660
so the stories is what you would it's

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:46,060
like the behind the scenes area it's in

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,760
the moment it's like a live it's not

00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,260
live but it's right away you take the

00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,670
video and you post it right away and

00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,800
people who click on your little profile

00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:57,930
bubble and see what you're up to at the

00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:02,020
moment your posts are should be more

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:03,550
announcements they should be just like

00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,020
if you have a good picture and you want

00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,020
to share just make it relevant to your

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,060
brand and don't don't make it random and

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,410
just oh I'm gonna post this picture and

00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,390
put a little emoji just so that I can

00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:17,040
post the picture you want to make sure

00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:20,370
that your content is relevant and

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:27,550
important to what you're trying to say

00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:29,490
so going back to consistent posting what

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,710
would you define as consistent like

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,720
posting making sure to post several

00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:39,400
times a week or going the extra step of

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,560
I post every Monday every Tuesday skip

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,230
Wednesday every third like yeah making a

00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,120
schedule like that is there is there a

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,980
key to that or is it just is or can it

00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,980
be just as loose as I make sure to post

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:53,050
three to four times a week personally

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,510
for me I find when I have like a rigid

00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,280
schedule if I have it scheduled that day

00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:01,450
I'm going to post this Instagram picture

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:04,210
then I will be more likely to do it so

00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,590
if you want if you want to grow your

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,480
social media and you're absolutely

00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,920
serious about it I would I would make it

00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,380
a little more rigid of a scheduled event

00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,820
so you would you would pick out actual

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,920
days that you will make sure you post

00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,420
that yeah week every week yeah and you

00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,580
want to know exactly what you're posting

00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:22,300
as well so as you're planning ahead

00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:24,700
you want to be able to have your images

00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,570
and your captions ready and know what's

00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,570
going on in your brand

00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:38,460
it's true it's true so I when i was

00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,069
using preview I was showing Jen Miller's

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,440
my mom if any of you know she works for

00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:45,450
me she she is the face behind need

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,980
someone to blog and she has a lot of

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,740
input into this as well so I'm happy

00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,480
she's here but when I was showing her my

00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,130
preview so I was just using this for my

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,539
personal Instagram because I want to be

00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,319
an influencer I want to be paid to

00:37:54,539 --> 00:38:03,299
travel - you know Cabo or whatever so so

00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:06,059
I was planning the beach day that I'm

00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:08,460
going to have tomorrow probably and I

00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:12,319
was going on Pinterest finding

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,910
inspiration for my photos and I was

00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:18,180
riding my cotton my comments and my

00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:27,809
captions and my little bubbles I know

00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:29,970
what was the question well you want yeah

00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:32,400
that goes along with making a theme for

00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,049
your brand on so on Instagram when you

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,760
go to somebody's profile you you know

00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:39,690
you see all their pictures in the little

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,599
square form and then you see their bio

00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:45,750
and everything but the theme of your

00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,130
Instagram speaks a lot to people who

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,299
visit you know if they go to your

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,099
Instagram and they see a theme they're

00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:55,319
going to be like oh she's serious about

00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:57,630
Instagram you know so it's just I know

00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:58,950
you want to match your editing style you

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,460
want to match your layouts and

00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,460
everything like that

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:11,120
well if you're selling a product you can

00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,680
include that I don't know if it's

00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,360
available to everyone yet but I think it

00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:18,920
will be as soon if you have a business

00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,360
account you can link that product and

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,830
people can click on your picture and

00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,680
there will be a little bag item and they

00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:30,260
can go there or you could just manually

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:34,070
put the link in but no if in your bio

00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:35,690
you could put your website link just a

00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,280
blanket website link but if you have a

00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,600
specific post that you want to link I

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:52,210
would recommend thinking that

00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:52,210
specifically in your post yeah of course

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,670
of course yeah well there's this girl I

00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,610
fall on Instagram she's a little more of

00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,080
a she's a in fashion and stuff and it's

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,580
just someone I follow out of personal

00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:08,330
interest but I think she does a very

00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:12,170
good job at her Instagram pro per se but

00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:18,260
social media all over the place let's

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:21,790
see what am i hmm oh right her name is

00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,790
let me look at her name really quick

00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:33,770
it is ELISA in the city

00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:39,860
ELISA Costco relly is her name but it's

00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:42,530
ELISA a ly s s AI n th e CIT y and I

00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,660
just her she does a really good job at

00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:48,470
keeping a theme at keeping consistency

00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:52,090
and keeping up-to-date on her stories on

00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,090
her bio on everything

00:40:53,470 --> 00:41:03,380
anything else no I haven't I have or I

00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:06,230
know people that do they find it easier

00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,180
for them but I I don't want too many

00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,010
hash you don't want too many hashtags on

00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,250
your posts unless they're separated are

00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:16,520
on Instagram on on Twitter Instagram or

00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,740
on Twitter hashtags are a great thing to

00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,320
use so you could use a hashtag generator

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,600
but I find that just thinking of them

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,530
myself and finding out the ones that

00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,530
work for me is better

00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:45,140

the social media channels right now but
