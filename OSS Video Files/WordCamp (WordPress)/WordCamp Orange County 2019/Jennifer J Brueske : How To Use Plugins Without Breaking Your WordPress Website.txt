you hear me okay all right was anyone

00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,920
here for the brand one that was right

00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,109
before this okay

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,130
so I'm the complete opposite Breyers

00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:21,320
myers-briggs from huh so I'm an INFP and

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,259
this is very painful but we will all get

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,939
through this together so I'm gonna talk

00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:30,589
about how to use plugins without

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:32,810
breaking WordPress so hopefully I'm very

00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:34,220
good at breaking WordPress so I'm just

00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,989
gonna walk through all of the things

00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,489
that I do to try to not break WordPress

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:40,850
as much as I used to when I first

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:43,340
started so you can find me on twitter at

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,660
chris go ninja that's its own story so

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,890
you can find me later and maybe I'll

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,109
tell you why

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,410
and speaking of brands that is my brand

00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:55,670
um if I many online games or anything

00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,870
it's a Kris go ninja so my slides are

00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,829
available at that URL

00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,420
I'll also tweet it out at the end so if

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:06,950
you follow me on Twitter you will find

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,320
my slides I'm not gonna walk around much

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,170
that INFP thing's gonna kick Animus

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,060
they're right here so um the things I'm

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,369
going to talk about is why would you

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,340
want to use plugins a lot of people hear

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,810
conflicting advice about plugins like

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,820
don't use them they're bad they sit on

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,430
your site and other people are like no

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,869
you could have like 50 it's fine so I'm

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,360
just gonna talk about what's the right

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,220
number of plugins to have you know what

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,520
what's that sweet spot

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,200
choosing which plugins you need

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,420
sometimes you don't need three caching

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,899
plugins it doesn't make your site three

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,549
times faster so that happens or

00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:46,909
recovering from something that you broke

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,130
I do that a lot

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,299
future proofing your site and I put that

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,049
in quotes and other amazing miracles and

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,240
then hope and healing

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,250
sometimes you can't save a plug-in maybe

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,110
it's your favorite plugin that you've

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,090
been using for like five years and it's

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,729
just not updated anymore or supported

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:10,009
and you have to let that go and find a

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:13,849
new solution alright so now what why

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:16,940
plugins my talk is full of gifts and yes

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:19,160
it's a gift and not a Jif that's a whole

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,160
nother talk so

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,900
a lot it's like wordpress is amazing

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,270
right out of the box it does amazing

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,730
things but sometimes you want it to do

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,100
more and if you're not really good at

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,470
like custom coding your own plugins and

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,360
like just making it do things by willing

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,920
it to do it you need to use other

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,230
plugins that other developers have

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,360
written or sometimes you just don't need

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,910
to reinvent the wheel if somebody made a

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,110
really awesome membership plug-in maybe

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,030
you don't need to spend three months

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,160
writing your own awesome membership

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,990
plug-in and we all like to support each

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,520
other in this community so if somebody

00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,470
already built an amazing product that's

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,470
gonna do what I need I'm gonna give them

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,600
my $30 my $60 and say thank you thank

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,610
you for putting that work in you made my

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,630
life easier so there's nothing wrong

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,480
with plugins and they're everywhere you

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,760
can find them on the repository

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,490
wordpress.org you can find them on paid

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,890
sites like code Canyon you can find them

00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:19,220
on people's individual websites like

00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,590
advanced custom fields right that's sold

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,880
on the advanced custom fields website so

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,560
not all plugins live on the repository a

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,630
lot of plugins live on the repository is

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,510
the free version and then you can

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:36,200
upgrade to if you need the pro or the

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:38,140
premium extensions so all of these logos

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,490
might look familiar

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,880
there's contact form 7 up there we'll

00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:46,190
commerce Yoast MailChimp things like

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,450
that jetpack do they all look familiar

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,740
ok oh and when I wrote those slides that

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,370
was how many plugins around the

00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:58,670
repository little over 54,000 so there's

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:02,210
plenty more isn't always better I

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,820
mentioned the hole 3 caching plugins

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:09,220
this was a client that came to us

00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,220
complaining that their site was slow oh

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,860
this is how many plugins they had and on

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,690
the plug-in page if there's a warning or

00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,980
an indication of something that it'll

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,780
have that yellow background so you can

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,120
kind of see they had kind of a lot of

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,710
issues going on the thing that I found

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,900
is they had three different caching

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,490
plugins going on and that doesn't help

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,669
because they just argue with each other

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,949
and all of those caching

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,360
do things differently and sometimes

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,490
depending on where you're hosting your

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,259
website like if you're hosting on WP

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,349
engine they have their own built-in

00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:43,180
caching so they don't allow you to have

00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:45,370
certain caching plugins because it will

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,069
interact with you know what they already

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,349
have in place so lots of factors go into

00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:53,020
caching plugins three does not make it

00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:54,729
better as soon as we turned off two of

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,520
them their site improved immensely and

00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:59,319
it turns out their images were too big

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,330
as soon as I resized all their images

00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,879
their site was super fast and they were

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,849
like you're brilliant I'm like thank you

00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:16,270
so try to do that just resize your

00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:16,990
images all right all right so uh things

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,669
I look for

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,159
like when I decide if I'm going to use a

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,860
plugin or not is what are the goals of

00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:25,900
the site if your site is simply going to

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,139
be your personal blog you don't need

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,909
WooCommerce on it you know so just take

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,249
a minute to go what do I want my site to

00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:37,000
do and try to make your plug-in choices

00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:38,439
around that goal what is this plug-in

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,810
going to do for you what's the purpose

00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:45,189
of it does it bring value to your site

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,189
may be having a plug-in that makes all

00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:50,379
your logo spin is it going to bring you

00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:51,729
a lot of value you might like it but

00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:55,779
it's not really going to give value to

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:58,300
your site and then is it supported in

00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:59,979
the repository a lot of people just do

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,659
their tech support right in the comments

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,159
and you can see exactly how the plug-in

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:04,899
author interacts with the people that

00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:07,659
use it some of them have their own

00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:09,339
external ticketing systems where you

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:12,849
have to have license key in order to get

00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:16,149
support but you can usually see how they

00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:18,550
treat people that buy their plug-in also

00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:20,770
a note on that when you buy or when you

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,180
get free plugins off the repository just

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,589
to understand those are human beings

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,379
that wrote those plugins that probably

00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:28,180
have real 40-hour week jobs their whole

00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,129
job probably isn't supporting that free

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,439
plug-in that you're using so have some

00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:34,569
patience when you reach out to them just

00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,669
say you know this broke this is what

00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:39,279
happened you know can you help me

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:41,500
instead of giving them a one-star review

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,519
and going this plugin sucks that it's

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,519
not gonna teach you anywhere so

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,200
all right so choosing your plugins how

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,970
many do you need

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,090
so can anyone else hear the song in your

00:06:51,970 --> 00:07:02,320
head from this I'm showing my age here

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:06,550
oh we can't hear it but yeah I know it's

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:10,390
crazy it's the 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,490
hey croaky okay there is no magic number

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,320
of plugins that's correct

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,570
it just really depends on what you want

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,150
your what you would like your website to

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,180
accomplish sometimes it's 12

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,360
sometimes it's 24 sometimes it might be

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,010
50 there's nothing wrong with it you

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,500
just have to make conscious decisions

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,670
about which plug-in authors you're you

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,380
know supporting which ones you're

00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,050
plugging in if they argue with each

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,200
other you know it there's no magic

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,200
number

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,110
all right here's plugins that I tend to

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,120
use a lot like just today like right now

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,490
this might change in a month in a year

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,600
this is just what I use right now a lot

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,520
so I use gravity firms a lot like a lot

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,850
a lot we have the developer license and

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,900
I am an evangelist for gravity farms

00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,730
there's other foreign plugins that are

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,870
just fine it's just I'm comfortable with

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,490
gravity farms and I know how to

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,250
manipulate it to do what I want it to do

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,320
I'm contact form 7 sometimes if all I

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,970
need is a super simple contact form on

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,970
the contact page and I don't need it to

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:16,240
do magic you know it contact form 7 is

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,640
amazing and it's free and it's supported

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,130
and it has a huge community behind it so

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,930
you know there's nothing wrong with it

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:26,100
if you're going to use contact form 7 I

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,000
suggest you use flamingo which is the

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,010
counterpart to that plug-in the same

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,410
plug-in author and it just keeps the

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,690
entries in the backend for you contact

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,660
form 7 by itself doesn't keep a record

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,039
of submissions so you need another

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,360
plugin like flamingo and there's some

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,800
other ones out there that will keep the

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,220
record of those submissions in the

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,230
backend for you um I don't know anyone

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,339
who doesn't use Yossi SEO I'm just

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,420
kidding I know there's other ones but I

00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,810
use that Yoast

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,810
it's just I'm comfortable with it I know

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:58,060
how to find all the settings you know if

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,840
you use all-in-one SEO not

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,400
- nothing wrong with it I you can pick

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,790
your favorite page builder the one that

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,350
we use is integrated with our theme and

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,780
so it's not like you can go download it

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,670
it's hooked to the theme but it's

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,560
drag-and-drop there's nothing wrong with

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,360
page builders and if you talk to

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,490
somebody who's like oh you use a page

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,640
builder there's nothing wrong with it

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,560
like it saves so much time like we all

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,980
probably could sit down and muddle out

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,020
an HTML website but let's not because we

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,130
don't have to so if you want to use a

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,660
page builder use it

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,950
don't let anyone make you feel guilty

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:38,890
for it okay advanced custom fields I

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,290
used that one a lot it's has a free

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,880
version and a pro version and I use the

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,500
pro version because I do some really

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,890
ridiculous things with advanced custom

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,360
fields so you can make your own custom

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,140
fields on custom post types with no

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,820
plug-in it's built into WordPress I just

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,930
like advanced custom fields because it

00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,640
makes my life easier

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:03,160
though and I like easy so I see ptui

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,860
that's an acronym for custom post type

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,600
user interface that is one of my

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,730
favorite plugins because we all can

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,410
Google how to put the snippet in the

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,720
functions file to get a custom post type

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,010
in WordPress it's readily available you

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,680
could google it right now and find it

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,210
but this one lets me manipulate it maybe

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,610
I don't know if I want it to have a

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,620
hierarchy or not maybe I don't know if I

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,660
want it to do some things so this is

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,890
just drop-down boxes of you choosing

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,350
things maybe you want it to have a

00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,690
different slug maybe you want it to you

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,730
know have that hierarchy maybe you

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,200
wanted to have custom taxonomies with it

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,110
and it just allows you to pick and

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,880
choose the nice thing about CBT UI is

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,800
once you get it the way you like it

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,270
it will give you the snippet that you

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,610
need to put in the functions file and

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,340
then you can uninstall it and you don't

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:51,370
need to keep it on your site it's really

00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,110
an amazing free plugin all right um

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,930
search and filter Pro is not a free

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,420
plugin that's paid but it allows me to

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:04,060
run Ajax searches on custom fields and

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:05,770
so I use that quite a bit I should have

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,140
put some examples up but it just lets me

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,090
like loop over and search all those

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,010
custom fields that I used with advanced

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,380
custom fields I'm

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:18,960
user role editor is that quite a bit to

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:22,630
give or take away capabilities for users

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,540
facet WP is really similar to search and

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,640
filter Pro the reason I might use facet

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,600
WP / search and filter Pro is because

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,600
you can have a map be the search field

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,460
so if you drag around a map it'll sort

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,020
the search results depending on where

00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,500
your map is looking and that's pretty

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,020
nifty um admin menu editor allows you to

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,690
remove things from the dashboard menu if

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,540
you like some of our clients don't want

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,460
to see 30 things on the Left menu they

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,860
just want to know how to post a blog

00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,230
they just want to know real simple stuff

00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,640
so they would rather only have four

00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,870
things over there and that's perfectly

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,050
okay we can do that for them

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,760
so admin menu editor makes it easy to do

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,840
that you can hide things you can disable

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,260
access to things and change how like the

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,660
editor view looks over there white label

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,760
CMS allows you to white label the back

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,390
end for your editor users you can add

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,730
your logo you can add I added a little

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,530
widget box with our phone number to our

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,030
office like hey if you're in here

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,560
editing and you're having problems you

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,390
can call us you know and it's got our

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,170
phone number so that's a nifty little

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,990
thing um profile builder pro is what I

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,310
use when I build membership sites

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,260
there's lots of them out there that's

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:43,030
just the one I learned and got

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:46,840
comfortable with WooCommerce that's kind

00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:50,860
of a duh for school commerce wpml log

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,630
helps me troubleshoot when I get the

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,760
client to calls I filled the form and it

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,050
didn't work

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,670
that helps me narrow down some issues

00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,620
because I can see whether or not if the

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,840
website actually sent the mail where it

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,260
got sent sometimes it's a headers issue

00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,030
sometimes it's an SMT key thing you know

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,440
trying to get forums to work it's stuff

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:14,920
on better search for a place helps me

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,190
get rid of dead links when I go live we

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,310
give our websites pretty little client

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,960
links like so and so iceberg web design

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,690
comm and that's where their dev link is

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,050
so when we go live we need to make a lot

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,029
of chain

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,470
those deaf links if they get hard-coded

00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:32,279
in there and better searcher place

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,260
allows me to do that fairly quickly

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,050
regenerate thumbnails that's awesome

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,320
well like when I optimized those photos

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,550
I just FTP damn then drag them over had

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,110
the same name and everything and then I

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,870
just regenerated those thumbnails for

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:50,800
that and it took care of all the other

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:53,410
thumbnails that WordPress made duplicate

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,760
post sometimes if you're making six

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,680
pages that are gonna look super simple

00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,540
or you know just duplicate them and then

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,029
go in and change the slug change the

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,329
content do all of that instead of having

00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:06,940
to rebuild the whole page maintenance

00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:08,079
plugins like if you need to put it in

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,360
maintenance mode while you're fixing

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,040
something major and you can have a nice

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,019
landing page and it's like hey we'll be

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,450
back later check back later you know I

00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,769
use that sometimes and then I don't know

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,740
does anyone in here know what this

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:22,570
plug-in classic editor is they might

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,149
have heard it all right yeah I use that

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,820
sometimes too not all the time but

00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:30,430
sometimes you know when Gutenberg came

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,200
out it's it's so new to all of us and

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,500
and it brings out some strong emotions

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,420
and people but it did conflict with some

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,920
of my older plugins and so I just have

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,720
classic editor on as a band-aid right

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,910
now while I'm trying to make things work

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,310
well together so there's nothing wrong

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,700
with classic editor and you can have it

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,860
so it forces everyone to use it or you

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,240
can do it where the person can choose on

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,500
the page that they're on they can choose

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,870
if they want to use Gutenberg are the

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,120
classic so that's pretty cool there's a

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,700
ton of other plugins just all of them

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,040
they do all sorts of things so how do

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,640
you choose which ones you need so I have

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,380
up here an iPhone x and a samsung s10 so

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,579
if you were going into the phone store

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,899
I'm sure you'd have a pretty good idea

00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:14,560
of which way you were leaning in before

00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,570
you even walked in the door and so why

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,420
like how do you choose that how do you

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:22,209
choose your brand so speaking yeah not

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,980
bad brand but uh you usually look at the

00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,140
specs what does it do is it going to do

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,370
what I need it to do both of these

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,660
phones are going to take pictures

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,760
they're going to watch YouTube they're

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,380
gonna play candy crush right they're

00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,089
good both going to do those things but

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,250
sometimes they aren't there are some

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,790
apps on the Apple Store that don't exist

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,640
in the end

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:43,140
right store maybe ones really important

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:47,620
to me and so that's why I want Apple

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:49,660
reviews read reviews even if the plug-in

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,230
doesn't have a perfect five-star review

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,270
that that's okay sometimes user error is

00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,800
a thing that happens and it doesn't

00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,030
matter how many times you explain to the

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,870
person they're still going to tell you

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:04,000
your thing is broken it just exists but

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,640
you can get a good idea of how they deal

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,680
with angry people are especially if it's

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,330
a paid plugin right you're paying for

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,460
that plugin so they should have some

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,110
sort of support with it and you can get

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,810
an idea of how they treat the people

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,250
that buy their plugin and then prior

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,600
experience with it the reason I use

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,340
gravity farms is because I probably

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,560
could make a farm in my sleep at this

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,560
point so it would take an enormous

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,740
amount of like buyout for me to change

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,720
what forum plugin I use it would have to

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,130
be like a big fancy new feature or

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,130
something that gravity farms couldn't do

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,290
alright so you found this most amazing

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,900
plugin that you're gonna use it's gonna

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,330
fix all your problems and you install it

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,180
and now you have the white screen of

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:51,730
death or you get a 500 error or like all

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,260
of a sudden your site's not up because

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,150
we all cowboy code right we just

00:16:53,260 --> 00:17:00,610
installed plugins on live sites and pray

00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:03,250
all right cool okay that's what I do so

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,040
then I do this a lot I get a little

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,410
worried I just forced a really simple

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,710
error that actually I think WordPress

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,240
and the later updates doesn't even come

00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,730
up with this warning anymore if I

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,190
remember right but this just has I have

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,040
a lot of windows open when I'm working I

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:23,980
have 50 tabs and like six sublimes open

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,710
and like Spotify going and I think I'm

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,660
typing in one window and I'm not and so

00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,160
I'll think I'm typing in my chrome and

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,710
I'm actually typing in sublime and then

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,620
I you know save it for some reason and I

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,200
have characters before my opening PHP

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,270
tag in in one of my files and that's

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,680
what this error is there's what it's

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,270
saying is I can't I don't know what

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:48,610
you're trying to do you have something

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:49,929
before the opening PHP tab all right

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,200
so you have to learn how to hack into

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:55,539
your own website there are a couple of

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,470
ways you can do it is anyone you're not

00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,890
FTP it into their own website that's

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,010
okay

00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,679
that's alright FTP can be your friend um

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,299
you can also usually have a file manager

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,299
associated with your hosting account

00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:12,039
um it's usually called file manager I

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:16,570
don't think I've ever seen it not called

00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:18,730
file manager and I prefer FTP and it's

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,130
okay either way is okay

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,049
FTP just gives you you can see on the

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,049
left there it just gives you a file view

00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:27,760
of all of your files in your website and

00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,840
it's okay to look at your file so you

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,700
aren't gonna break anything just by

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,429
looking at them you'll break them when

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,210
you open them and save stuff to them and

00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:38,440
I often do that too so you should know

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,059
how to get in there you should at least

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,039
know how to get into your website files

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:44,039
whether it's FTP or File Manager

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,029
alright so talking about this mythical

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,010
future-proofing and other amazing

00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:53,500
miracles I hear this a lot lately it's

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,350
an awesome buzzword let's future proof

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,380
things and that sounds great but it's

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,809
kind of impossible um I don't know the

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,909
word proof maybe they could have said

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,769
like I don't know I don't even know a

00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:12,309
better word future proofing just seems

00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:14,320
so solid so like maybe some nerds in

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:15,700
here I'll get this chill but remember to

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,029
turn your computer off before midnight

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,679
on January 18th of twenty thirty eight

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:24,490
because that is when the unix time step

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,529
as we know it today will stop working so

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,659
it's the y2k bug all over again I'm

00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:31,450
telling you

00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:33,490
so the 32-bit UNIX timestamp will no

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,779
longer work after that date so I'm sure

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,960
they'll just come up with like an

00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:39,580
amazing 64-bit or something right some

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,399
smart people I'm sure we'll fix it we've

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,340
got time um and then when you look up

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:47,200
future proof in the dictionary it says

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,350
that of a product it means that it's

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,909
unlikely to become obsolete so it's kind

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,470
of like you're trying to peer into the

00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:57,820
future and decide what's gonna stick

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:59,529
around and what's not so I it's kind of

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,880
like a myth to future-proof your site

00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:04,730
but it is a good idea to go with things

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,360
you know a solid like my dad had a beta

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:11,300
tape player and turns out VHS one so we

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:15,350
lost out in that future-proofing moment

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:18,880
and like you know blu-ray and HD you

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:21,740
know see discs they blu-ray one so

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,810
sometimes it's hard to guarantee future

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,560
proofing your site things happen things

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,880
change on PHP 5.6 has an end-of-life I

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,000
don't know if you guys heard about that

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,360
but you know you gotta upgrade just got

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,220
to do it and so it's a good idea to keep

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,650
up on those news updates like we've

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,680
known about the end-of-life of PHP 5.6

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,180
for a while and then it turns out

00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,670
everyone just waits till the last minute

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,380
and panics but you can start to put

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,000
those things into place when you hear

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,630
about them or read about them or just

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,330
even keep up on it the Google algorithm

00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:02,150
I think changes every six seconds not

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:04,010
sure I'm it's just my experience with it

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,360
it has mobile-first indexing which you

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm sure you've heard a lot about today

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,700
and so that's a difference in how they

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,340
rank your sites

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,190
Gutenberg's brand new um how many people

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:19,160
actually enjoy Guttenberg in here

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:22,870
woah minority okay that's okay um I am

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,340
getting used to it I'll just say that

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,050
and then what's next I have no idea

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,630
what's next I mean that's the amazing

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,940
thing about the industry we're in like

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,740
things change and cool new things come

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,500
about and better ways to do things

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,380
happen it's awesome it's actually a

00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,380
really really fun thing so how do you

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,450
keep up with it so you read and you read

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:48,100
and you read some more you go to

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:50,720
conferences like these make connections

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,240
trade business cards emails Twitter

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,250
handles whatever you need to do get

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,280
involved in your local WordPress meetups

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,650
and groups I'm from Minnesota we have

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,610
quite a few meetups in the Minneapolis

00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,590
area and just go meet people talk to

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,210
them then you have resources of when

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,360
something breaks and they might know how

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:13,220
to help you fix it um read any news

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,050
updates from your host when you log in

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,090
to your host

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,920
Dean and there's a big banner that says

00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:20,020
hey we're gonna do this thing you should

00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,450
probably take a moment to read what they

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,250
wrote to you they don't typically put

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,740
meaningless stuff in those warnings

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,780
should probably read it and then ask

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,730
questions of the community get in a

00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,430
Facebook WordPress group go to more

00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:38,320
press meet up and be like hey I have a

00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:39,940
question I've never been in a job career

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,130
community where people are more willing

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,680
to help just ask

00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,790
even in teaching people were not this

00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,410
open and helpful

00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:52,930
I promise so like just seriously ask

00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,520
reach out raise your hand ask if you

00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,890
feel like it's a dumb question it's not

00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:02,320
just ask it we all have had that

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:05,200
question at some point back up your site

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,160
and update it on the regular whatever

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:12,670
that means once a week once a day try

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,800
maybe more often than once a month but

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,660
just do it make sure if your host

00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,280
doesn't have an automatic backup in it

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,440
look for some plugins that will help you

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,910
do it or manually download all your

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,910
files and your sequel dump I mean

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,400
whatever lunch boat but you know make

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,680
sure you backup um some problems can be

00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,990
solved simply by updating WordPress and

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,220
your plugins that's sometimes that's all

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,320
it takes you hit that play button and

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,870
bam the problem is gone but sometimes

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,420
you hit that button and that's what

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,820
causes the problems so it's kind of a

00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,730
50/50 that's why I always hit the button

00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,100
and I'm like woo let's see okay so

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,030
especially when it's cool commerce hit

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,380
the button go oh let's see so but

00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,630
seriously back up and update your site

00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,180
so what happens if your plugin doesn't

00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,800
have any updates available what if it's

00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,590
like eight years ago that somebody

00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,660
touched the code so it doesn't

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,880
necessarily mean it's not gonna work it

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,380
really just means what was in that

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,260
plugin what code was in that it might

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,050
still work I found one that did didn't

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,940
break WordPress I was pretty impressed

00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:18,190
but chances are you might want to find

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:22,250
one that's been touched more recently

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:24,169
than eight years ago um

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,850
if you find out your plugin is several

00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:27,889
updates behind WordPress you might just

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:31,429
have to find a replacement you might

00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:32,659
have to just bite the bullet what

00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,759
happens if you get stuck in this

00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:39,639
notorious update loop how many you have

00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:42,950
been stuck on the screen okay if you do

00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:44,389
okay so um you know it doesn't

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,460
necessarily mean everything's broken

00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:48,440
WordPress has this awesome built-in

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,289
thing that when you're updating stuff it

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,179
puts up the splash screen to keep people

00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:56,120
from seeing all the girls stuff it's

00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:58,730
updated in the background so if you go

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,759
into your FTP or your file manager

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,740
because you're an amazing hacks or now

00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:06,289
you will right see a dot maintenance

00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:09,379
file and now don't do this immediately

00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:11,629
give the plug-in a minute or two give it

00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:13,340
a hot second to actually update but if

00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:15,590
you're really stuck on this screen it's

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,039
been five ten minutes there's this file

00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:21,350
in there dot maintenance just delete it

00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:24,049
it's fine I promise and then you're

00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:26,450
settled be backup um I've had this

00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:28,399
happen sometimes when I am not paying

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,669
attention and I go update all and that

00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:37,309
I'd navigate away that's usually when it

00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:39,259
happens to me um let's see all right

00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:41,929
hope and healing you can't save them all

00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:47,240
and I just need to leave let this gif go

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:49,929
all the way through if you haven't seen

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,110
big hero 6 seriously go see big hero 6

00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:55,460
solid movie sometimes you can't save

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,080
them all sometimes you have to find a

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,340
replacement sometimes you reach out to

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,830
the plugin author and they're like yeah

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,019
I don't do that anymore and you just

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:06,769
have to change and that's ok

00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:08,720
change is good change is fine alright so

00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:10,850
if you see these kind of errors on a

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,100
plug-in and you can't get in to

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:15,259
deactivate the plug-in that's kind of

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,830
scary sometimes does anyone had that

00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:21,230
happen yeah so you can either FTP in or

00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:24,440
go to your file manager and you can

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,409
rename the folder of that particular

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,289
plug-in and it will deactivate it that

00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:31,909
way that's a really crude way to do it

00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,710
but if you're in a time crunch and it's

00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:35,450
the only way you can get in you can do

00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,879
that and that's only good if you know

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,489
exact

00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:39,419
which plug-in caused your problem

00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:40,949
sometimes you don't know sometimes

00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,139
you're like me and you go check all the

00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:48,959
boxes and hit update you hope it works

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:51,419
out so this was a screenshot of Spotify

00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:52,499
not too long ago and that made me feel

00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,089
good because I was a look

00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:57,089
keeping Spotify screws up sometimes

00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:59,759
their CSS wasn't loading I probably was

00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:02,129
like a CDN issue or something but it was

00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,479
it was entertaining for me my son didn't

00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:06,959
find it entertaining so he was trying to

00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:09,239
sign up for an account but consult

00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,859
Google you know ask people that you know

00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:15,359
hey is there something up with this or

00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:18,149
you know stuff like that last year when

00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,789
I came here at plugin Palooza the plugin

00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:22,979
that one was a plug-in detective and

00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:24,329
that's gonna help you figure out which

00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:26,009
plug if you don't know which plug-in

00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,989
caused your problem plug-in detective

00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:30,749
will run whether you have a white screen

00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:33,959
of death or not it will run either way

00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:35,579
and so like if you don't want to have to

00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:37,019
try to troubleshoot it by yourself I

00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,209
recommend this plug-in it's pretty cool

00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,549
and it has some amazing animations that

00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:42,329
keep you entertained while you're trying

00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:46,529
to figure out what's wrong with your

00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:48,269
site and like I said I just mentioned

00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:50,879
this on the last slide bulk updating

00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:53,069
superfast but it can be super dangerous

00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:55,379
so if you also like to live dangerously

00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:57,690
go ahead and update off you know 40 of

00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:58,199
your plugins and hopefully it all works

00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,099
out

00:27:58,199 --> 00:28:03,389
you know I when I am out of patience

00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,879
sometimes I do that but I've learned the

00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:08,759
hard way just go one at a time update it

00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:12,589
see if your site's still there update

00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,589
the next one and move on

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,579
alright so I crammed a lot of

00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:19,919
information you in a short amount of

00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:21,589
time so if you have questions I can

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,949
answer them I can try to answer them

00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:24,949
anyone have any questions

00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,779
no look you guys yeah

00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:49,400
that's okay yes oh yes very

00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,770
time-consuming and it really depends on

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,840
which client said I'm working on if I

00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,370
have a client that is an e-commerce and

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,150
most of their business comes from their

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,220
ecommerce store

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,680
I'm not gonna do the click and pray

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,420
method I'm gonna put it to a staging

00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,400
environment or a local environment and

00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,960
then I'm an update WooCommerce and then

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,630
I'm gonna see if it's broken on my local

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,980
site or my staging site and then I'll

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,440
still pray a little bit when I hit the

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,820
button on the live site right so it

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,550
really just depends if it's somebody's

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,110
local like reality blog you know I'm

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,030
less likely to go oh I need to put this

00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,820
on staging make sure it doesn't break

00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:28,500
like really I just I'm gonna update that

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,230
one because it to fix that one is

00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,600
probably very less amount of time than

00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,220
to fix a giant ecommerce store that's a

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,990
little more intimidating my favorite

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,190
thing by the way is when WooCommerce

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:51,720
changes hooks off my favorite so

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:53,490
solid-solid times yes um okay so the

00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,260
question was how do I conflict trouble

00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:58,230
like troubleshoot conflicts between two

00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:00,480
different plugins my first step is

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,220
google his chances are I'm not the only

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,130
person that has those for two particular

00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,340
plugins if I don't find anything there

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:10,920
I'll go to this separate support for the

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,540
both the plugins like recently I'm

00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,370
having an issue with advanced custom

00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:19,590
fields and gravity forms not listening

00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,300
to a conditional logic thing and in the

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,820
form that I'm trying to troubleshoot has

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,920
I'm not kidding like 20 conditional

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,680
logic rules going on right now it says

00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,210
it's a ridiculous form and so I'm just

00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,370
sitting in and with an older version of

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,860
gravity forms because I haven't had time

00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,210
to look into its but I'm not the only

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,400
one with that issue it was nice to

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,640
google it and see oh it's not just me

00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,020
and so hopefully you know they have that

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,180
on their radar and they're gonna fix it

00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,430
in the you know because those are two

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,230
big pretty giant plugins so they'll

00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,300
probably more than likely talk to each

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,090
other if there's smaller plugins free

00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,840
ones you might be the one

00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:58,250
has to write something to change it um

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,810
WordPress when you up doe upload things

00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,060
to the repo they do a pretty good job of

00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,130
being like hey your function names are

00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,710
super general maybe you could not do

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,140
that so that you there's less conflicts

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,720
now than there used to be but I just

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,520
Google the heck out of it I ask

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,950
questions on Stack Overflow and try to

00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,970
duck when people throw paper balls at me

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:21,770
when they're like that's a dumb question

00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:23,330
I'm like okay thanks you know a lot of

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,890
times I don't even have to post on Stack

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,960
Overflow because somebody's already

00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,280
asked it and taken the bullet for me and

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,670
then I just read through the answers and

00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,920
you know try to fix it I wish there was

00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,170
like a list I could give you do this do

00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:42,100
this do this do this but it's so

00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:42,100
situational but any other questions yeah

00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:51,410
what are the things I do when I FTP in I

00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:54,140
do a lot of customizing templates and so

00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:56,000
it's a lot of being in the PHP files of

00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,510
WordPress like if I have a custom post

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,340
type of home listings for instance a lot

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:03,050
of times I'm customizing that template

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:07,700
so I'm in there messing with the single

00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:09,830
- homes page and I like text editors

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,410
because it helps me see my code more

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:15,500
clearly and so I usually have to pee in

00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:17,210
when I'm doing code based things we're

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,580
changing things in the stylesheet even

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,380
because I like the way sublime which I'm

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,020
now going to try vs code by the way but

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,910
I like the way sublime lets me see my

00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,190
style sheet I feel like it's easier on

00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,170
my brain to see it and sublime that it

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:35,090
is in the like WordPress appearance

00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:41,800
editor so basically it's just a personal

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:41,800
preference any other questions

00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,780
if I need to change the database that's

00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,870
actually usually through a my sequel

00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:57,740
like interface like PHP the my PHP

00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:59,210
and in all our hosting that we use it's

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,520
just a button I have to click to get

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,800
into the my sequel but I try to do that

00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:07,130
as little as possible because I only

00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,960
have a very little working amount of

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,600
knowledge of sequel and I don't want to

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,790
like fork anything like I don't want it

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,020
makes me nervous to get in there but I

00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:19,100
can if I have to sometimes like I don't

00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,480
know if this is what this must be a

00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,480
WordPress core thing but like when you

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,910
change the admin address it sounds like

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,740
a email and is like are you sure and I

00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:31,370
if I go change it in the sequel database

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,020
it doesn't trigger the email but I don't

00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,880
spend a ton of time in the sequel

00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,880
database I'm usually just in template

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,210
files of the content folder did you have

00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,210
a question

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:54,130
staging eyelet Dom no I haven't is that

00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:54,130
like a cool nice

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:06,520
that's awesome I should have put that on

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,919
my list I use WP rollback sometimes okay

00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,899
but um yeah there's so many cool staging

00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:12,820
tools out there I've used flywheel local

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:15,280
by flywheel even though I don't host it

00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,500
flywheel I probably should but I don't

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,450
but I still use their tool local by

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,639
flywheel because it's just a it already

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:26,109
made lamp stack for you just it's

00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:30,250
amazing any other questions or are we

00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:32,050
all ready to go drink and sing we can

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,609
sing the Sesame Street song come on I
