Carrie Slayton Carrie currently works

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,230
for iceberg web design in Minneapolis

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,529
Minnesota

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,390
building custom WordPress websites she

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,099
loves using her creativity and diverse

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,990
background to solve all kinds of

00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:27,630
problems a noted extrovert Carrie owes

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:32,850
me a big kick give it up

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,550
Carrie Slayton thanks everybody

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,809
you guys can all hear me okay I hope

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,649
you're ready to have fun we're gonna

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,190
have so much fun

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,020
forums are really fun so but I do want

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,510
to get you guys a little bit see where

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,800
we're at here how many of you have been

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,770
developing custom themes and WordPress

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,539
for more than five years all right

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,340
you're not in the right room probably

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,010
want to go out there how many of you

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,300
guys are kind of more new to WordPress

00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,570
just kind of more getting started might

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,039
be your first word camp raise your hands

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,530
all right so this talk is really aimed

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,420
at beginners I really wanted to give you

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,490
guys things that you could go home and

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,260
use immediately when I first started

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,270
attending word camps I was very

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,409
overwhelmed by some of the level of

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,270
technical difficulty at the

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,189
presentations and felt like I didn't

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,720
belong and then felt like I had to go

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,310
home and do a lot of research to

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,130
implement some of the things that I had

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,080
learned and I wanted you to give you

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,250
guys some wins early on and teach you

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,920
guys some things that you can go home

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:35,070
and use right away all right raise your

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,189
hand if you filled out a form ever in

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,900
your life okay every website has a form

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,340
right there all over the place but forms

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,509
can do so much more than just collecting

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,500
a name and an email address I'm going to

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,320
show you some of the things that I've

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,720
done with forms there we're going to

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,280
talk about using conditional logic we're

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,890
going to talk about passing variables

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,869
from one form to another we're going to

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,460
talk about creating dynamic surveys and

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,380
ways that you can display the results

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,619
and we're going to talk about generating

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,140
custom PDFs so my slides I do have small

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,670
writing and a lot of detail so I would

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,549
say don't try to read it don't try to

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,160
take notes I will have a link at the end

00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:15,450
and I'll tweet out a link so maybe just

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,640
follow me on Twitter if you want to see

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,020
my slides there are examples kind of

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,270
step by

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,470
step and there are links to the actual

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,480
websites that I've built with these

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:31,850
actual forms okay why should you listen

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,720
me because my love forms we already had

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,220
an introduction I'm not going to go

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,920
through my whole history

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,080
I work in Minneapolis I do custom

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,010
WordPress development I used to be a

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,900
freelance website developer and I've

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,570
also been a stay-at-home mom an

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,580
information technology director and

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:53,320
worked in geographic information systems

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,630
so this is kind of like my third career

00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,530
all right so a lot of what I talk about

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:03,950
uses the plug in gravity forms there are

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,650
1 million different plug in different

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,970
foreign plugins and I'm not really here

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,390
to have a debate on which one is the

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,730
best

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,250
they all are pretty similar and I'll do

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,900
a lot of similar things I personally use

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,090
gravity forms in every website that I

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,760
built I'm very familiar with it and it

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,470
has really good documentation there's a

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,270
really big community of users if there's

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,830
something that you want to do and you

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,660
think maybe you could do it with the

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,670
forum chances are somebody else has done

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,680
it they've written some code for it and

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,680
they've posted it in a knowledgebase so

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,630
ok so now we're just gonna get started

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,090
conditional logic is something that

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,540
sounds complicated but it's a really

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,040
very simple concept if you tell somebody

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,630
that you're going to build them a form

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,150
with conditional logic they will

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,190
instantly hand you twice as much money

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,540
so it's a good thing to know so

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,830
basically like I said I'm gonna start at

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,930
the very beginning conditional logic

00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,370
basically means that you want different

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,420
things to happen under different

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:05,180
circumstances so we are at a word camp

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,890
everybody loves swag at work camp so

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,300
here's my example if I wanted to give

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,240
you some swag from iceberg because of

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,290
course we put a penguin on everything

00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,690
how am I going to know what to give you

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,669
if you're a beer drinker I might give

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,810
you a bottle opener if you're not a beer

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:20,419
drinker I'm not gonna give you a bottle

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,640
opener right so if you happen to be

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:25,300
addicted to Lacroix I'm gonna give you a

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,770
key and kuusi so I would need to know

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,710
what your favorite drink is and then I

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,870
would respond differently

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,130
pending on what that answer is right so

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,030
that's kind of how to think about it

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,100
when you're when you're working with

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,510
forums when you use conditional logic it

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,710
just means that you want something to

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,750
different to happen

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:45,640
depending on what information they're

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:48,880
giving you in the forum so I actually

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,980
made a forum for this so here is my

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,360
first question what is your preferred

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:57,940
beverage so it has a radio check box for

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,190
I like to drink beer from a bottle or I

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,010
like to drink Lacroix so how would we

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,320
actually go into gravity forms and make

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:10,540
something different happen depending on

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,550
which answer they select here in gravity

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,710
forms under the jet after the general

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:19,210
tab there is an appearance and advanced

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:21,370
so in advanced you can check the box to

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,200
enable the conditional logic and then

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,770
it's just kind of plain English so it

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,570
will walk you through the steps so I

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,190
want to show my field so I made my

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,650
question field and now I have whatever

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,990
information I want to display and so on

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,650
to show the field if the following

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,170
condition is met so what is your

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,810
preferred beverage beer from a bottle

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,690
that's the first answer that they could

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:54,700
select so if they select that then show

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:57,120
the contents of this HTML block let's

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,120
see an example

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,580
so this information down here is in my

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,190
HTML block and so I'm telling gravity

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,180
forms to show this HTML block if this is

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,180
the thing that's selected

00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:52,799
okay so let's talk about a real-life

00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,329
example of when we did this so we always

00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:56,519
have consultations with our customers

00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:57,929
and talk about their processes and maybe

00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,699
ways that we could improve things for

00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:02,909
them and so this is a customer that we

00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,639
had that is like a like a shipping

00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:07,709
broker so they match drivers truck

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,899
drivers with people who have loads that

00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:11,729
need to be delivered and so they

00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,799
originally came to us and they just you

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,869
know hey we're a new business we need a

00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:17,309
website prove that we exist but we sat

00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,110
down and started talking to them about

00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:20,459
how they work in their processes and

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,860
found out that they were having a

00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,249
problem where they have a registration

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,129
form

00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:29,249
that's a PDF based form and they want to

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,349
make all of the fields required but not

00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,879
necessarily all the time but the times

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,529
when they do need to be required they

00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,149
really need to be required so for

00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,679
example if you're applying to work with

00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,389
them and you use a factoring company

00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,799
they they need to know the name and

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:42,749
address of your factoring company so

00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,909
that needs to be a required field but if

00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:45,989
you don't use the factoring company you

00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,579
don't need to fill out that field right

00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:49,669
so they were having all kinds of

00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,649
problems with their fillable PDF of

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,729
making fields required or if they didn't

00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:56,339
make him required then they weren't

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:58,469
getting information that they need it

00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,329
and so I said well I can make you a

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:01,709
conditional logic form for that and they

00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:05,519
instantly ended us twice as much money

00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:07,229
and so for this example it's a similar

00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,110
kind of thing where you answer the

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:12,360
question on factoring does your company

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,389
use a factoring company and if you say

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,909
yes these fields show up and they're

00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,679
required but if you say no the fields

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:25,799
don't even show up so the fact that

00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:27,779
they're required doesn't matter another

00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:31,049
example of conditional logic is another

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:35,639
form I built for a company who wanted

00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:37,649
kind of a like a like a help contact us

00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,120
like a help desk kind of thing where

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,589
they're really really their customers

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,959
would end up doing four different things

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,439
and they had a huge like if they answer

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,819
this

00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,139
they had like a flow chart for me if

00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:47,910
they answered this then we want this to

00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:49,910
happen you know what I kind of said well

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,309
it seems like really you just have four

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,410
different areas and you want four

00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:57,750
different forms to show up depending on

00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,420
the thing that they need help with and

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,089
so I made this form for them where it

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,889
starts out

00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,899
just a call to action what can we help

00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:07,449
you with today and then depending on

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,759
which button they select the rest of the

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:12,009
form shows up and so the beginning of

00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,809
this form is just regular radio buttons

00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,299
and I just see us that's the out of

00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:18,099
it and hit the little radios and threw

00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:20,439
in some fun awesome icons and made them

00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,909
turn colors when you select them and it

00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:24,609
actually looks really cool and works

00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:31,749
really the way that they that they

00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:33,249
wanted to okay so we're going to talk

00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:34,629
about conditional logic a lot in some

00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:36,969
other some of the other examples but I'm

00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:38,739
going to move on to another thing that I

00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:41,609
do a lot in websites and this is passing

00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:44,379
variables from one form to another so

00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:47,889
with some of our websites designs we may

00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:50,109
have a home page that has a tiny little

00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:53,379
call to action or a tiny little form

00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:55,929
that says request a quote or for this

00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,639
case this is a Montessori School so this

00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,319
tiny little form says oh hey schedule

00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,819
your visit and they see three simple

00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:02,409
fields oh no problem I do want to

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:04,869
schedule visit and so they fill that out

00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:06,999
and then we suck them into the longer

00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:09,609
form they may not I feel that if they

00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:11,229
saw a line it was but we don't want them

00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,879
to re-enter the things that they've

00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:14,709
already entered on the short form so

00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,019
we're going to pre populate the second

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,779
form with the data that they entered in

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:21,909
the short form so you can see this

00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:24,279
little penguin person that entered the

00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:26,679
form data their data automatically got

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:30,309
populated into the second form so how do

00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:34,089
you do that you do that by passing

00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:37,169
variables so typically when you would

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:39,819
fill out a form when you click Submit

00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,949
there's just text that returns that says

00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:44,139
thank you for filling out the form well

00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:46,209
with gravity forms you can control what

00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,629
you want to happen when your form is

00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,779
submitted

00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:51,999
and so in the settings you can use

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,169
different options for the confirmation

00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,929
so the confirmation that they've

00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:58,539
successfully filled out the form what do

00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:00,249
you want to happen in this case we don't

00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:01,449
want to show them any text we don't want

00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:04,329
to thank them for filling out the form

00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:07,629
we want to redirect them somewhere else

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:10,299
and we want to bring some data with that

00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:11,190
redirection so we click the option for

00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:14,220
redirect

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,800
and then we have a URL so the URL is

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,020
where the longer form lives and then

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,630
we're gonna pass some data via query

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,360
stream so first you would make your

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:27,450
short form and then you're just going to

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,760
assign some variables you can name the

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,690
variables anything that you want it's

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,850
always a good practice to use

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,710
self-documenting code and you do

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,230
something that makes sense so for this

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,120
example I have two fields name one which

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,780
is first name and name two which is last

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,800
name so I'm calling these variables name

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:49,470
one and name two and then I'm gonna set

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,630
the variable equal to a field from my

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,730
short form and so you can just select

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:58,590
the field from the little drop-down and

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:02,790
this query string is going to pass this

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:05,880
data with it into the URL in the longer

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,020
form what you would do is set up your

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,620
fields that are going to be able to

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,660
accept data to them and then put in the

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,520
name of the variable that you selected

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,800
so if you had called them first name or

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,720
last name in the second form

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,490
you're just saying allow the first name

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:30,480
to be populated by any value that is set

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:32,940
to name one okay here's another kind of

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,300
a little bit more complicated example of

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,340
this so this organization is the

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,820
Minneapolis police activities League and

00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:44,520
they run sports programs for kids in the

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,980
neighborhood they run football t-ball

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,940
basketball they have a brain and body

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:53,700
camp but they only want one form for all

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,890
of the different programs but baseball

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,730
doesn't go in the winter and hockey

00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,800
doesn't go in the summer

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,450
right so they were getting all kinds of

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,339
people that were registering for a

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,560
program or seeing that they wanted to do

00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,720
a program that wasn't in season so they

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,940
wanted kind of a simple way to open

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,860
registration for some sports clothes

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,660
registration for other sports but not

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,950
have to have a different form or do a

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,770
lot of work you know switching out

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:20,130
content on their website so I made a

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:23,040
little first form it's just a one field

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,370
form that selects the program that

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,020
they're in

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,610
interested in and then there's some

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,490
conditional logic that display is

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,800
depending on what they select and then

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,500
it brings them to the longer form okay

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,029
so if you select golf it's going to say

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,370
registrations close right now

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:40,440
if you select football it's going to say

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,600
Oh registration for that is open and

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,400
here's your register button and then

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,100
when you click the register button you

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,089
lead to the second form and the program

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,650
that you're interested is already

00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:54,180
selected on the registration form if you

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,660
just go to the registration form without

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,520
you know following the short leading if

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,380
you select one of the sports that you

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,240
can't register for the submit button

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:09,420
doesn't even show up and says this form

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:12,180
this sport isn't available right now so

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,520
this form was created the same way this

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,990
short form has a valuable called you

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,420
know sport that they registered to and

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:22,589
then that variable is passed to the

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:26,520
longer form okay

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:29,459
you could also pass a variable by just

00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:35,820
simply including the variable in your

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:37,890
URL this customer again had kind of a

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,060
unique situation always starts with

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:43,740
sitting on and talking through their

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,660
process and they are attorneys and they

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,029
are gonna have profile for each of their

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,470
attorneys online okay great do you want

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:51,350
contact information on your profile do

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,390
you want you know direct telephone line

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,010
email address and they said yes we want

00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,160
email address listed we want them to be

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,510
able to email us and then they said no

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,830
we don't want to email listed we don't

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,970
want them to be able to email us what

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,209
they didn't want is they didn't want

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,890
people accessing their individual emails

00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:09,029
they wanted to have control over whether

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,980
or not they were going to interact via

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:14,820
email with you know a particular

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:18,720
potential client and so we created a

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:21,300
simple just email button and then that

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,120
is passing a variable into the form so

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,950
we created the form where you can select

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,200
who it is that you want to email and

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,000
then there's conditional logic on the

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,720
back side of the form routing it to the

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,120
right person and then for the profile

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,110
when you select email LN you don't see

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,970
her email address

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,680
you're just brought to the forum her

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,560
name's already selected and then when

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,590
you submit it it routes to her so how do

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,290
we get the URL that says email Ellen to

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,150
pass the information with it of who is

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:57,150
going to email well you simply do that

00:15:51,150 --> 00:16:00,440
in the URL so here's my wordpress

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:03,420
content editor and normally I for a URL

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,910
for a link I would have an H ref and

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,100
then just the address of the page I

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:11,480
wanted to bring them to well all I have

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,720
to do is on the end of the URL a

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,970
question mark and then a variable and

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,490
then a value for the variable so I'm

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:25,470
assigning a variable of send message to

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:28,260
and then I want it to be Ellen in my

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,300
form that I'm passing this data to when

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,490
I have the radio button of the different

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,950
or the drop-down of the different people

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,190
they can select I can also give a value

00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:40,110
to those so with gravity forms you can

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,990
choose to enable values or not enable

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,490
values if you just have a form with some

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,980
radio buttons and you don't necessarily

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,460
need a value you can always leave this

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,310
off but if you want to give a value to

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:58,610
these different choices you can give it

00:16:53,310 --> 00:17:02,730
a value so in order to email Ellen I

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:06,690
need to pass this value of Ellen so the

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,640
URL that you're leading them to is the

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:11,640
contact us URL where the form lives and

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:20,130
then send message to and then this value

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:21,750
is Ellen this is an example or this is

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,800
showing the conditional logic for the

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:28,800
forum once it's submitted so these are

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,240
form notifications and so you can set

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,340
conditional logic up in the forum

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,370
notifications similar to how you can

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,470
show or hide different fields based on

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,720
what the answers are to questions with

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,090
conditional logic you can send messages

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,610
to people and then have some parameters

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,460
that that they have to meet in order to

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,470
send those message so we're only going

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:57,620
to send messages Jacki

00:17:49,470 --> 00:18:01,110
if the selection is selected Jackie okay

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:04,830
dynamic surveys here's another example

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:09,360
of ways to use forums to kind of display

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:14,309
data so for this forum what the customer

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,870
wanted was a survey okay so first I'm

00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,809
thinking all right okay survey you know

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,890
question each question has points out of

00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:22,620
all the points when you're done here's

00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,870
you know here's your results no that's

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,440
not what they wanted what they had were

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,390
30 questions on their survey that we're

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,030
measuring things over seven different

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:36,059
domains and each question might be

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:39,030
weighted a little bit differently and so

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,770
once they fill out the survey and they

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,100
have these these waits for their

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,990
questions they're gonna get a score and

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,809
then we want to compare their score to

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,030
an industry standard and tell them what

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,010
their score was and then tell them how

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:56,100
they compare to the industry standard

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,450
and if they don't match the industry

00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,860
standard if they're below industry

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,000
standards then we want to try to sell

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,710
them our services because these are

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,480
consulting services so for each of the

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,640
answers in in the survey questions we

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,530
ascend instead of assigning like maybe a

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,750
text value like we did for the email

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:19,590
addresses we're assigning a number value

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,159
and so for these the values are pretty

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,740
small

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,059
that way we can double them and then do

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,220
some math with them to kind of account

00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:30,659
for like the different the weighting and

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:36,570
then averaging over the domain so each

00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:39,659
answer strongly agree disagree neither

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,909
agree agree has a value over here okay

00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:44,760
so we'll point zero one a point zero two

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:47,070
point zero three point zero four point

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,909
zero five so if we double them its point

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:55,049
zero two point zero four point zero six

00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:58,260
etc okay so now you to the fun stuff so

00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:01,559
now we do some math so in order to add

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,580
up these values all we really need to do

00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,380
is

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,300
all we need is a place where we can do

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:10,650
math and then somewhere where we can

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,120
store this value so one of the reasons I

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,380
like gravity forms and one of the

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,320
reasons their documentation is really

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,200
nice is they have filter hooks that you

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,120
can hook into and so you can grab a hold

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,220
of your data after it's been submitted

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,770
to gravity forms and you can do stuff

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:30,090
with it manipulate it before it gets

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:32,970
then submitted so this is my functions

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:36,990
file and this is my function that I

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:41,220
wrote in order to calculate the results

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:43,310
of the survey so the filter hook that

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm using is the G form pre submission

00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:49,290
so that is an existing hook from gravity

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,460
forms that like I said grabs the data

00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:55,880
before submission and then we're going

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,380
to run this function and the function is

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,870
evaluate results right self-documenting

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,710
go okay so we start with the total of

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:08,670
zero and then we're going to add the

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:11,160
value from the input so the input the ID

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:14,100
number corresponds with the ID number

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,740
from gravity forms so each field in

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:25,350
gravity forms has an ID and you can see

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:28,650
those up here so this is field ID one so

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,600
the input for whatever they select if

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,690
they select strongly agree that's going

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,030
to be input one okay so we're just

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,640
starting at zero we're adding whatever

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:41,130
they said here with whatever they said

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,420
for the next question with whatever they

00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,380
said for the third question and whatever

00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,610
it said they said for the fourth

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,880
question so those are the four questions

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,680
for my first domain then I'm going to do

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,860
some math because I need to account for

00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,650
the waiting we're gonna round it because

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,160
you know we might get some decimal

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,590
points in there and so this math was all

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,650
done like an Excel spreadsheet first to

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:07,590
set up the weights of how we're gonna

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,180
actually measure the results so I just

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,790
had a formula that I could copy and

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,400
paste in here and then we do it again

00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,990
for the second domain

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,200
and then on and on until we get to the

00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,930
seventh domain okay so now we're going

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,730
to display the results of that data so

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,260
once somebody is done filling out this

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,559
form they've answered all 30 questions

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,809
they see this webpage and it says these

00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,210
are your results of your survey so for

00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:35,990
your rule making domain your score was

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:38,510
50 and then here is a graph of though of

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,730
that result so here's your 50 that's

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:43,390
your score and then here's the top

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:47,420
performers they get a usually a score of

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:49,760
95 and then here's the median so you can

00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,320
kind of see really quickly visually how

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,900
you measure up against industry

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,640
standards and then that was a pretty

00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:03,290
good lead magnet into then selling a

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:07,880
consultation in order to display the

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:11,540
dassault the results we use gravity

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,980
forms again and you get to say how what

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,780
you want to happen after the form is

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,670
submitted so in this case we just want

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,100
to show them some text we just want some

00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,380
text to display on the website and so

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,920
we're still within gravity forms using

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,330
the confirmation and so we still have

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,670
access to with this little button here

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:32,330
all of the fields that live inside of

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:35,780
our form and so we can say all right

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:39,350
their score was whatever I had as the

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:42,320
answer for this for this score and the

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,290
last one and then we were able to use

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,210
just like a plug-in that does like a

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,190
skill bar where you can just put the

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,840
number in and so again for the number

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:57,020
we're just using the values from our

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:59,390
form to you to display on that bar okay

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,670
so let's make our own survey maybe we'll

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,740
kind of your how to keep them at home or

00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,179
simple so I'm just gonna have a quick

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,030
survey on what's your spirit animal

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:10,700
right so if you're a morning person and

00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,610
you answer yep I'm a morning person you

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:17,090
get one point if you or sometimes that

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:19,160
would be two points rarely three points

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,470
and don't talk to me before 11:00 that's

00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:26,240
my answer that would be four points so

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,510
in gravity forms we're going to assign a

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,510
value

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:38,220
and then we're going to add these values

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:40,379
up the other thing that we need to do in

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,659
gravity forums and I don't know if I

00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:44,999
have a screenshot of this is you need a

00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,289
place to put this value right where

00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:48,419
you've added them all up you have to

00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:50,039
store it somewhere and so the easiest

00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,769
way to do that is just to create another

00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:55,039
form field that's hidden to the user so

00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:57,659
the user doesn't see it and that's just

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,879
maybe your result would be a good thing

00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,639
to call it so you just create a field

00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:04,230
that's a result field and then after

00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:06,869
you've added your data in the functions

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:10,200
file you put that answer into your

00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:11,940
results field so that's this part right

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,970
here where it says set the score value

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,340
the score value is equal to your total

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,909
here so when you created your variable

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:24,029
to add up your total and you put your

00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:26,549
input numbers in then you're just using

00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:29,639
the same filter hook to insert that

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:30,990
total into your last field that the user

00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:37,350
didn't answer because they couldn't see

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:38,879
it and then here's the example of what

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,460
maybe your results page would look like

00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:43,889
so you have two choices you can either

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,809
have only one results page like we had

00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:48,419
with the example for the health care

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:51,869
company and you could say oh if your

00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:53,879
answer is between zero and five then

00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:56,070
your spirit animal is a penguin if your

00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:58,350
answer is between 5 and 10 then your

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:01,919
spirit animal and your spirit animal is

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:03,889
a giraffe or you can have conditional

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,139
logic that says if their answer is

00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:08,970
between 0 and 5 I want to show them this

00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:10,409
page with a picture of the penguin

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,279
saying that's what your spirit animal is

00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:15,929
or if their answer was above 5 I want to

00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,860
show them a completely different website

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,860
a different web page

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,750
okay so this is kind of my last cool

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,200
thing that I like to do with gravity

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:34,570
forms and this is an add-on for gravity

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:37,190
forms it's called gravity forms PDF and

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,560
pretty sure it's free but it allows you

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,630
to take form data so normally when you

00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,220
submit a form whoever gets the

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,990
confirmation for that form they usually

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,880
just get an email that says oh somebody

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,540
fill out your contact form and this is

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,950
the information they've provided well

00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,930
oftentimes we want to take that

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,610
information and put it into different

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,730
display make it look really nice with

00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,980
the PDF first long forms especially

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,930
forms that may have like a signature you

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,700
might want that all to be bundled up in

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,410
a nice PDF with the signature field at

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,880
the bottom that somebody could print or

00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:13,790
file into a folder and so this lets you

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,670
take your form data and put it into a

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:20,960
PDF so we use this for our customer who

00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:22,880
does an online course and once you

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,760
finish the course you need a certificate

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,110
they didn't want to handwrite all the

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,220
certificates for the people who are

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,260
taking their course they wanted this to

00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,890
be more of a thing that you could do on

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,320
your own

00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,870
and so what we ended up doing for them

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,880
is give them a password-protected page

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:41,000
and once you finish the course you get a

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,800
password for the page and then it's a

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,270
really simple form where you just put

00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,960
your you know the name that you want to

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,220
be on your certificate and then your

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,460
email address where their certificate

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,990
gets mailed to or get sent to the course

00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,630
that you finished and then the date that

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,520
you finished it and then when you submit

00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,170
the form you get the little test most

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,430
tests text message that says

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,190
congratulations on completing your

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:07,430
course and then what you get emailed to

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:10,520
you is a PDF that has their form data in

00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,750
it but you can style it with CSS or with

00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,250
the background image to make it look

00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,250
like this great little certificate

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,130
so here's the same example with the form

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:28,120
that we had for the transportation

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,770
company they get PDF form with all of

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:38,650
the data and then the signature so that

00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:40,390
they can file these ok so that was kind

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,090
of my quick run-through so I can do an

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,200
online or I can do a live demo if we

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,350
want to do that or I can just take

00:28:44,200 --> 00:29:05,110
questions and we can answer questions

00:28:46,350 --> 00:29:05,919
does anybody have any questions yeah do

00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:11,200
you want to use the microphone so

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:14,370
everybody can hear you sure yes in the

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,230
form that you have input 1 2 and so on

00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:20,559
that's obviously that kind of indexing

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:23,020
is convenient for the computer but for a

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,620
developer human beings that doesn't make

00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,580
sense

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,620
is it possible to label them instead of

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,470
give them a variable name or no under

00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:36,940
forms yeah so when you have so let's go

00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:38,860
back and look at an example okay so when

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,490
you have a field where there's multiple

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,320
choices if you want to use values you

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,720
can use either number values or

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:51,010
text-based values so if you want to do

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,020
something like pass the variable and you

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:56,220
want it to have a name so that you can

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,720
you reference it easily they can be

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,450
text-based values that's totally fine

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,620
the reason that their number values is

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:07,630
so that we can do math okay so on the

00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:11,169
certificate you said you send them a

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,549
password-protected site so that dig URL

00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:15,549
so that they could create their own

00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:17,679
certificate yes what happens if they put

00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:19,600
somebody else's name on the certificate

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,240
uh yep I mean we talked to them we laid

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,620
out a number of options and they they

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,260
understand that that is something that

00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,220
can happen they wanted something that

00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,870
was easy

00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,190
that they didn't have to monitor that

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,980
the user could create their own

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,470
certificate yep but I don't make

00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,870
business decisions for customers I make

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,250
implementation decisions and so if they

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,470
tell me how they wanted to work I'll

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:54,350
make it work that way but I don't tell

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:59,330
them if that's a good idea you want me

00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:01,130
to go to the end yeah okay sure yep yep

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,440
so these slides are at ice if you can't

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,440
read this it's iceberg web design com

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:11,150
slash fun with forums and that's just a

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,950
link right to my Google slides so at a

00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,540
quick question yes I've never actually

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,929
seen some be passed data from one form

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,059
to another

00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:19,940
yes so we don't do very complicated

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:21,320
forms Network I know there's

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,470
functionality and gravity forms to do

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,870
step by step forms well yes in what case

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,450
would you get that versus a passing data

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:31,520
from another form yep so the reason that

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:35,120
I would pass data from a short form to a

00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,090
small form is more of you know they're

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,280
more for like emotional reasons because

00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,840
you want somebody to only answer a

00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,760
little bit of the information and not

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,350
make such a big commitment at first and

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,000
then take them to where they have to

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,460
make the full commitment where I would

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,860
use a multi-page form is something like

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,390
the destination transport website where

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,270
they're filling out their application to

00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,710
be a driver a carrier there they've

00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,330
already committed they know they're

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,270
gonna work with destination transport

00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,980
they I've got them so I would take a

00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,040
really long form and that one actually

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,929
is a six-page form and break it up into

00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,520
functional sections so first I'm going

00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,290
to collect all the information about the

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,179
actual driver then I'm going to collect

00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,580
insurance information upload your

00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:18,260
insurance certificate then we're going

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,610
to talk about you know the Terms of

00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:24,620
Service and use gravity forms to do a

00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,990
multi-step form so you're going you know

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,220
and then there's a little I think I

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,590
might have a picture like you can see

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,640
how far you are in the process which is

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:37,460
really nice

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:39,990
yep I didn't grab the whole thing on

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,630
this page just the top

00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:45,040
yep all right I think we have about ten

00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,049
minutes probably eight now yes what is

00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,460
your question for your certificate back

00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,660
here mm-hmm have you ever worked for

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,190
likely gift certificate so you're gonna

00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,840
establish a gift certificate number

00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,530
that's gonna change each time and then

00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,809
include them with a check out yep so

00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:03,340
similar but not exactly the same with

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:08,559
the form for the like the ticket system

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:10,780
for the help form they wanted each they

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:16,240
wanted each form submission to have a

00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:18,250
unique ID and so for that I did have to

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,030
write a function that assigns the unique

00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:24,070
ID but again I'm using a blank field at

00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:26,290
the top that's my reference number and

00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,419
then in my functions file I'm writing

00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,790
just a little function that assigns a

00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:32,230
unique number and that I just grabbed

00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,520
from gravity forms documentation I

00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,470
probably didn't write it I'm sure I

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,140
copied and pasted it and then putting

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,179
that in the empty form field so that

00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,980
when they it's not something that they

00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:43,809
enter but when they get their email that

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,580
says thank you for filling out your form

00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:47,559
they have a reference number and it's

00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,890
gonna be unique so they can just call

00:33:47,559 --> 00:34:02,190
and say my reference number is you know

00:33:49,890 --> 00:34:02,190
yep anybody have any other questions yes

00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,460
subscribe leave for mistakes file

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,379
uploads how do you restrict which file

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,179
formats you can just type them in so

00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:13,030
there is a field that says restrict to

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:16,770
what formats and you say dot PDF dot

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,770
ping and that's it

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,580
I love gravity forms too I noticed that

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,890
you're loading in contact form seven as

00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,350
well a feature that you're using that

00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:36,510
for her know by default a theme the

00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:39,510
theme that I use brings in contact form

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:43,230
seven by default and so I usually just

00:34:39,510 --> 00:35:01,110
kind of pop that out of the box but I

00:34:43,230 --> 00:35:05,100
hardly ever use it I think so let's see

00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:07,370
I think of a picture yeah yep I use that

00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,370
one a lot

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,859
know the times when I've used gravity

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,050
PDF I basically want an external

00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:38,849
snapshot of the data that's not living

00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:41,310
inside of an email message and so if

00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,349
formatting is an issue there's templates

00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,390
that you can that you can use with

00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,400
gravity PDF comes with some templates

00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,820
and so you can use one of their

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:55,680
templates or you can you know CSS magic

00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:57,240
so it looks nice for the certificate

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,770
it's just a background image and then

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,660
you're just putting in but I've never

00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:03,780
had an issue where the PDF isn't

00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,250
grabbing some of the data whatever I you

00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,210
know would say can go through it would

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:10,589
go through yes they're doing like a file

00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,010
upload yeah actually that's a good

00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:13,080
question

00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,730
in this in this form right here they're

00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,369
doing a file upload because they need a

00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,520
picture of their insurance certificate

00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:22,920
and so gravity PDF it just gives you a

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,710
URL link and so the image lives on your

00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:35,940
WordPress site and in the PDF you have a

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:37,740
link to it nope nope not to hijack my

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,240
wonderful coworker Carrie what I'm

00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,430
working with gravity PDF right now to

00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,710
pull in information that wasn't on my

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:46,050
gravity form you can overload or

00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,940
override the template and it's just a

00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,619
PHP file and anything you can do in

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,050
WordPress you can do in that template

00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:55,109
file so I'm pulling in advanced custom

00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,880
fields based on post IDs and and my PDF

00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:58,800
is quite different than what the form

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,280
was that was submitted and it's all

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,280
based on a post ID so it's once you get

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,950
into it it can do anything you can do in

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,170
a PHP template it's very cool and the

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,589
only problem is the CSS styling for it

00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:15,450
is and PDF styling so it's not

00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:17,760
necessarily the same as yours you know

00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:20,150
standard CSS so you just have to keep
