Title: Amy Hall : Ecommerce and Email: How to get more ecommerce sales with email
Publication date: 2019-05-14
Playlist: WordCamp Orange County 2019
Description: 
	Building eCommerce websites for your clients is a good niche for any WordPress Developer. But once the site is built, the goal is for sales. Setting up eCommerce Email Marketing can not only add value to your offering, but help your client get more sales.
In this talk, we will break down three key types of email subscribers: interested, engaged and lapsed. More importantly, will open up the dialog with the attendees so they get actionable tips to bring to their clients Monday morning.
Feel free to ask how eCommerce can be optimized with welcome emails, product promotions, abandoned cart sequences, transactional emails, page triggers, upsells, email coupons, birthday specials, re-engagement campaigns, and newsletters. You will want to bring your real-world questions and a notepad for this session for sure.

	00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:10,690
so today we're going to talk about

00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:14,289
e-commerce and email and how to get more

00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:17,619
ecommerce sales with email and I'm a

00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:20,260
real chip expert but MailChimp doesn't

00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:22,780
work well with e-commerce so don't use

00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:27,340
it don't tell them I said that because

00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:32,289
I'm going to MailChimp next week so

00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:35,800
today you're gonna learn the three plus

00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:41,909
a little sub group types of subscribers

00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:44,139
on your email list and the 1 million

00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:49,960
different email formats for e-commerce

00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:52,809
and which email format to use for which

00:00:49,960 --> 00:01:03,969
type of subscriber to move them down the

00:00:52,809 --> 00:01:10,540
road to sales so email is the alpha male

00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:13,750
I love that one so first we're going to

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,250
talk about the subscribers and this is

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:21,430
an interactive presentation like the

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,440
last half of this presentation it's

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,970
going to be about you working through

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,760
some of this process so please feel free

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:37,480
to shout out your questions during the

00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:41,950
session so the first kind of email

00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:46,000
subscriber is interested what is that

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,570
little thing on my there you go they

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,980
have not purchased your products yet and

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:57,190
they want more information about your

00:01:50,980 --> 00:02:00,970
products about how to use them about how

00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:04,450
they will fulfill their needs and what

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:07,360
your products actually do that will help

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,510
them with what they need done does that

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,510
make sense

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:20,340
the second type of email subscriber is

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:24,330
an engaged email subscriber so in

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,220
e-commerce we say the engaged kind of we

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,260
thought there's a subset of engaged too

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,770
but we say the engaged email subscriber

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,260
has purchased your products and here's

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:40,920
the real distinction there in your

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:44,010
ecommerce database the interested are in

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,180
your email database these are in your

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:54,690
e-commerce database that's a specific

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:58,560
distinction there so on the engagement

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:02,040
you get to choose the timeframe that you

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,510
say these people are are in the engaged

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:10,410
group so and that could be dictated it's

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,060
usually dictated by your industry so in

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,240
some industries they're gonna have lots

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,870
of purchases like if your shopping cart

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,920
for groceries like instacart you're

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:26,010
gonna expect an engaged email subscriber

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,100
to purchase in your shopping cart once a

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,400
week but if you're an auto repair store

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,739
your engagement might go down to they

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,470
make make may make a purchase at once

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,300
every six months once a year and that's

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,480
still going to mean that they're engaged

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:48,300
in purchasing so it all depends on your

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:50,370
products so this is the subset of

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,280
engaged they're engaged they've

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,660
purchased in the past but they're

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,670
inactive now so now they're not

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,910
purchasing they're opening your emails

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,400
but they're not clicking through they're

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,430
not taking that next step to make the

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,640
purchase and you get to choose the time

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,640
frame depending on your products again

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:25,380
so it just depends on your products how

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:28,260
long you're gonna give you're gonna say

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,240
it's gonna take to make them inactive

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,730
they're gonna be clicking through on a

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,440
regular basis but they're not going to

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,960
be purchasing so for me a really good

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,710
example of that is Michaels I click on

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,620
Michaels stupid email that one there was

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,750
like 48 thousand million long miles long

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,390
I click on that every single week I do

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,790
not purchase from the email ever because

00:04:51,390 --> 00:05:01,890
don't take away my Michaels experience

00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:05,550
man never so and this is one of the most

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:09,960
important kind is your elapsed and your

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,780
elapsed haven't opened an email and they

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,380
haven't clicked on a link and they

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,930
haven't purchased and usually rule of

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,450
thumb is and again depends on your

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,930
product in your industry usually rule of

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:29,690
thumb is six to thirteen months and

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,690
again depends on your product

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,580
so I love this quote from Meg Whitman

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:47,010
the communication is at the heart of

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:49,260
e-commerce and community so one of the

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:53,480
things that I see ecommerce sites doing

00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:56,310
is not communicating enough with their

00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,350
with our people like Michaels doesn't

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,720
email me back and say hey we saw that

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,590
you clicked on those fun spring flags

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,570
for your house why did you purchase or

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,460
let me send you some more so you'll go

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:13,680
purchase so here are the basic email

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,620
campaign formats and this is the

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
interactive part it would be great if

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,590
you see something that I've missed

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,240
because I came up with a lot of them if

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,280
you just shut up shout it out and I do

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,010
have two slides so if you shout it out I

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,600
may have it in a second I just told you

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,290
to shout it out and then I told you not

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,290
to shout it out

00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:40,470
all right so even email campaigns for

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,350
any website along with e-commerce

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:47,720
websites are welcome else everyone

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:52,200
should have any welcome ma'am everyone

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:55,830
product promotions email coupons or

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:59,220
discounts birthday specials you don't

00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:02,539
have to have this but this I have a

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,440
couple of clients that are extremely

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:07,200
successful with birthday specials

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:13,560
restaurants are accessible what birthday

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:17,070
rest specials newsletters they're pretty

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,530
good at written down transactional

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:25,560
emails everybody know what a

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:28,530
transactional email is abandon cart

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:33,510
sequences one of the most important

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,680
ecommerce emails that there is thank you

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,960
thank you Christina

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,200
so transactional emails are the emails

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,210
that you send out when people buy when

00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,010
they put something in the cart and they

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,720
purchase you know you send them that

00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,120
email that says thanks for your purchase

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,660
and then the next one you send is here's

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,020
your traffic

00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,410
link and then the next one you said is

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,830
your package was delivered here's a

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,290
picture of your porch with the delivery

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,180
so those are transactional emails are

00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:07,190
just one they're not sent to the

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:13,860
homeless or sent to someone individually

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:15,990
paid sugars review requests a lot of

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:20,460
people won't send don't send these and I

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,860
think that these are brilliant and a

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,160
review request is when you you ask

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:30,480
somebody to review the product that they

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,880
just purchased and then reengagement

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,729
campaigns and reengagement campaigns are

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:42,390
where the gold gold is in my opinion I

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:43,770
love very engagement campaigns the page

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,640
sugars all right

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:51,240
so page triggers are where you do

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,850
conversion pixels and you may send an

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,320
email where they click off to go to a

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,700
page so you can have a page sugar that

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,070
way where it's triggering from an email

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,260
there go to the page and if they don't

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,140
click on anything on that page and they

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,810
get off the page you could send them a

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,760
triggered email that way or if they go

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,650
to a page and they click something but

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,940
they don't purchase you can send them a

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,940
trigger to eat email that way

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,770
okay so now we're getting to the

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:29,380
interactive part Wow

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:36,210
I thought that was going to take 20

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:36,210
minutes so who gets what

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:46,510
so if your subscriber is interested now

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,430
and notice I said subscriber because

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,880
interested people are subscribers

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,550
because they haven't purchased yet

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,280
they're in your email database so

00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:02,580
they're in your you probably have some

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:05,400
kind of email service provider MailChimp

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:10,540
god forbid Constant Contact

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:12,390
activecampaign convertkit something like

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,680
that

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,950
so the interested are the people that

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,370
are in that software they're gonna get a

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,340
welcome email it's also good to send

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,370
them product promotions especially if

00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:31,720
you can track the campaign the page that

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:33,430
they came into your emails list from but

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,180
if you have subscription forms on

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:40,690
specific pages on your site and you

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:43,570
track that subscription form where they

00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:46,440
signed in to your email list then you

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:49,240

birthday specials birthday specials work

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:45,020

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:09,620
so she can send you specials when that

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:13,000
birthstone is on sale which is great

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,200
with that and then regular newsletters

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,940
don't forget to newsletters and these

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,440
letters are always good when you cut it

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,090
what are you coming up with where are

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:29,000
you and the news are you gonna be at any

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:30,620
events these letters are always good so

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,100
here's the engage remember the

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:38,680
distinction on the engaged is that these

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:42,590
people are in your e-commerce database

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,010
so they have not opted into your email

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,990
list

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,990
and they have to be treated completely

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,020
differently you cannot send these people

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:55,130
a newsletter because they have not asked

00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:57,260
to be sent the newsletter so you sending

00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,500
them transactional emails and the

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,050
transactional emails again is the hey

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,630
thanks for purchasing and on that

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,730
transactional email we're gonna get it

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,790
to it on the next slide but you can

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:15,260
actually you can add an upsell egg you

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:17,270
bought you bought this computer most

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,420
people when they get this computer they

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:23,390
need this power pack to go with it and

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,550
on the bottom of that thing up the email

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:30,530
out of the listing for the power pack so

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:32,390
they can just click on it and buy well

00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,000
upsells was right underneath it okay

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:38,030
review across after they gone through

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,750
all the transactional emails then the

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,760
review request comes in it needs to be

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,290
the last email that you send them you

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
need to send them a link

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,300
where you want them to review you can't

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,070
just expect them to psychically know

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,509
where you want them to review you want

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,490
to send her the link to if you're

00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:57,649
selling on Amazon you want to send them

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,410
a link to the Amazon review area if

00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:05,509
you're you know you want them to review

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:08,420
you on Yelp or on your website you need

00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:10,250
to send them to that area with a

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:16,490
specific link of where to get that

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:23,569
review from abandon cart sequences so

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:30,019
these can be as basic and as detailed as

00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:32,690
you want to make it and you want to send

00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:34,639
them frequently you usually want to do

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:39,709
an abandoned cart like within an hour

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:42,220
you get abandoned cart okay so on

00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:45,259
abandoned cart email is when somebody is

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:50,300
shopping on your site they put things

00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:52,760
into their shopping cart to purchase but

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:58,130
they don't complete the purchase which

00:14:52,760 --> 00:15:00,649
I'm super guilty of because I am easily

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,139
distracted and I go in twelve different

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:06,440
directions you know we all have those

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,569
browsers with 50 open windows not that I

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:13,010
would ever do that but I do

00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:19,550
and so I abandoned cart emails are great

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:22,940
for me and I would send them an hour a

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,510
day and maybe even a week if you're

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,579
abandoned cart will last that long

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:33,769
product promotions if you have somebody

00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:37,610
who just BOTS sway bars for their truck

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:43,009
on their keeper travel trailer from

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:44,779
swaying I'm doing that then you want to

00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,689
send them additional product promotions

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:52,040
what kind of what is the next step that

00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:54,019
they would get to buy to keep them so

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,990
safe when they're towing their travel

00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:59,000
trailer you know and send them a product

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,920
when you have a new product a new

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,110
persuade bar that may work better than

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,500
your old sway bar may send them the new

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,390
product promotion and email coupons and

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,820
I hate telling people to send email

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:14,000
coupons as I'm one of the people that

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:20,270
says you should never do a coupon you

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,270
should always do a value-added offer but

00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,730
I'm not one for 10% off because then you

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:28,940
devalue your product I'm one for okay

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:33,560
and you get this handy-dandy vegetable

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:35,990
slicer also no I think a value-added is

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,700
much better than a coupon and you can do

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,830
it either way you can do a coupon for

00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:48,470
value-added or I can do a coupon for a

00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:51,830
discount so for engaged but inactive and

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:55,100
remember these engaged again are not on

00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:58,970
your email list there in your e-commerce

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:02,350
software so you can do page triggers if

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,699
they go to a page and they don't buy

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,180
that something on that page gets

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:10,579
triggered and it sends them an email hey

00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,829
why don't you buy this or are there any

00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,520
questions here's the 10 questions that

00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:19,610
we usually get about this product and

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:25,449
send them a little fa Q's product

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:25,449
promotions email coupons again yes sir

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,570
right

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:43,310
no it should be in your e-commerce um

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:50,000
software remember engaged but inactive

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:51,560
have already purchased from you but

00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,470
they're in your e-commerce software not

00:17:51,560 --> 00:18:02,390
your email oh I'm sorry I'm sorry he's

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:15,160
for my Maivia question I'm just super

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:15,160
nervous I'm so sorry okay

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:22,160
okay so he was asking about the engaged

00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:23,810
but inactive he was saying that he was

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,520
like but they're not on the email list

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,520
how are you gonna send them an email and

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,290
I said remember engaged engaged past

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,630
purchased from you so you do have their

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,610
email but they're inactive they haven't

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,620
purchased for a while and usually

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,230
they're still opening your emails

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:48,620
because they're engaged but they're not

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:51,220
purchasing necessarily and last so

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,110
lapsed or my favorite because you can

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,720
recover all sorts of stuff from these

00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:00,770
people re-engagement campaigns or

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,810
engagement campaigns are golden anybody

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,980
know how to reengage needs more

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,570
information about re-engagement

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,570
campaigns right

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:11,030
so a reengagement campaign is when you

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:15,040
have cited what your time frame is or a

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:17,510
lapsed person and this does for

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,970
everything it doesn't necessarily have

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,970
to be ecommerce it can be on a regular

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,680
website also if they haven't purchased

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:30,230
or if they haven't opened your emails

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,270
for a while you need a reengagement

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,910
campaign to see if they're interested in

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,810
getting your emails and to see if you

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:43,580
can trigger them to opening your emails

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:46,400
and this is how you clean your list so

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,170
those people who haven't opened in the

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,550
last

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:55,080
depends on your time frame but I would

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:58,520
say like last six months you send them

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:03,350
an email and you make the subject line

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:08,160
shocking like hey do you hate me or

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:10,050
what's up did I do something wrong you

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,840
you make it very personal and you make

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:15,090
it a little bit shocking and then people

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,780
will have more of a tendency to open it

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:22,100
up and at the top of every engagement

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:25,200
campaign you put a big huge red

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,390
unsubscribe button because the object of

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,430
a reengagement campaign is to get people

00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:33,990
to unsubscribe themselves or get them

00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:39,060
back on the list and get them back

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:42,180
active but I love unsubscribers it

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:45,360
sounds weird but I do because then

00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,090
there's not Deadwood on your list you

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,650
know your list if the more your list is

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:56,160
active the more your list is opening and

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,590
engaging with what you do the more your

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:05,340
list will be delivered the more your

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:07,710
emails will be delivered it's that that

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,240
thing with your website where how do you

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,100
get people to your website where you

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,010
need traffic to get people to your

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,410
website and but how do you get people to

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,730
your website well you have to build your

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,480
traffic to get people to your website

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,880
it's that little circular thing how do

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,440
you get more people to open your emails

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,030
well you have to have people opening

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,040
your emails to get more people to open

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,930
your emails because the more people open

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:38,910
your emails the better deliver ability

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:42,510
again so here's the super interactive

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:46,890
part let's go through and plan some

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:50,820
people's campaigns actually where I'm

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:58,190
best at so first off what were your

00:21:50,820 --> 00:22:00,290
trigger be so what are you gonna say

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:05,809

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:08,960
well make your system send an email what

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:13,100
actions are your people gonna take on

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,280
your website to make them to make your

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:21,200
website send it an email

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:26,960
can anybody got anything I can use I

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,910
purchase okay that one's super easy then

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,169
what will success look like oh it's a

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:34,850
purchase right but you want to plan not

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,590
only the trigger but you want to plan

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,950
what you want these people to do at the

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,410
end right what is the outcome that you

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,080
want have what will your success look

00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,510
like and this is for honestly every

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,590
single email campaign that there is you

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:54,410

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:57,950
be how will you know that this email

00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:00,679
campaign is successful I build

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,809
everything from there because that's

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,630
gonna give me everything inside the

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:08,110
email campaign that's gonna give me the

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,130
content that's gonna give me the images

00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:14,690
sometimes that's even gonna give me the

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:18,679
trigger but okay so our trigger is gonna

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:21,760
be purchase

00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:26,799

upsell or let's go back

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,700
you might even add a review request they

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:59,159
were purchased and you can add it there

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,909

00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,440
received it and when they've used it for

00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:06,690
a while and also have you have a digital

on a regular basis and purchase even

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,220
more

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:41,030

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,200
just gonna send it thank you

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:49,670
no we need to send tracking information

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:55,670
so we can get in their inbox again we

00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:57,440
need to send the review later on so we

00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:02,390
can get in their inbox again the more

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:05,060
times you can land in their inbox the

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:10,160
more likely you are to get a response

00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:13,460
from them it's the numbers game there

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,470
and then what's your sent sending

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,300
schedule well on a purchase that's

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,900
pretty simple they're gonna purchase and

00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,130
you're gonna send immediately but the

00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,400
shipping what are you gonna send the

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:30,440
shipping information are you going to

00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:32,480
create the tracking number automatically

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,190
and then ship that send them the

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,260
tracking number when it's created

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,050
automatically even though it hasn't

00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,970
shipped or are you going to wait until

00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,370
it's actually shipped and then give them

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,930
the tracking information there's nothing

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,170
I hate more than getting tracking

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:50,780
information before something has shipped

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:54,950
because it's sitting there and I don't

00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:58,820
know when it's gonna ship yes so you

00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:00,380
have to you have to think of what what

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,200
your customers gonna want what are they

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,720
gonna want to see for the time frame or

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,800
for you're sending schedule oh we missed

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,900
time frame so the and then you're

00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,240
sending schedule not only is it gonna be

00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,760
your thank you it's also going to be

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,810
your shipping and then review request

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,390
and then when are you going to send from

00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,670
your review requests isn't it

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:28,280
immediately are you gonna send it in two

00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:32,300
weeks are you gonna send it again in a

00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,650
month and now you have to distill the

00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,190
all this down what do you think your

00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:40,850
customers are gonna be most open to what

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,930
are they going to be most likely to when

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,020
are they going to be most likely to

00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:47,650
actually give a review as those are

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,650
golden

00:27:50,590 --> 00:28:01,520
all right so anybody else want to go

00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:03,290
through this process okay okay how would

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:10,010
you go through this campaign if you're

00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:11,450
not selling a product okay so if you

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,340
just have a newsletter and you're a

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,290
content provider and you just want them

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,450
to stay interactive with you what would

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:21,440
you do first thing I would send them old

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:24,260
welcome email and tell them and this

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,950
should be for your e-commerce also send

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:31,790
them in a welcome email and tell them

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:34,490
what they can expect from your your list

00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:36,080
are you gonna send them emails all the

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,950
time are you gonna send them in

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,370
frequently when can they expect are you

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:45,410
send them weekly monthly quarterly what

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,910
kind of information are you gonna send

00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,670
on your emails are you gonna send them

00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:51,320
links to real cool articles that they

00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,020
can go visit are you gonna send the blog

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,700
posts you know are you gonna RSS feed

00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,330
then blog post I mean there's just so

00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,370
much that you can give them on that

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:05,330
welcome email and then we haven't even

00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:11,000
gotten into the topic of your site yet

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:12,620
and how you can give them an insight to

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,610
your site and where they can get more

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,890
information from and again if you have

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:20,900
subscription forms like I always tell

00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,900
people put subscription forms on each

00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,570
one of your blog and then you can use

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:30,110
you can track it which vlog that's

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:33,080
coming from and then you can send them

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:37,180
information specifically about those

00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:39,680
blogging topics so that they can get

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:44,290
deeper and deeper and deeper into the

00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,290
topic yes sir

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,780
so is there an awesome optimal length or

00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:02,540
number of words or size for follow-up

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:07,770
email no and here's what I'm gonna say

00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:12,150
every email should be short think of the

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:16,160
time that you have to read an email most

00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:19,170
people do not have time to read a book I

00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,210
always tell people they don't listen but

00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,740
I always tell people one thing on your

00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,350
email that's it

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,820
send it weekly and send one thing on

00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,460
your email instead of sending it monthly

00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:33,390
and sending 12 things because people

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:36,150
will not scroll statistics state and I

00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:39,630
can give you all of my experience the

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:41,640
top most links are the most clicked

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,550
links and as you go down and go down and

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,210
go down less and less and less and less

00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:51,990
clicks bones connect social connect

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:55,080
buttons on the bottom rarely like maybe

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:58,140
point zero zero zero one percent our

00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,130
code quite fun and I see thousands of

00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,500
email campaigns

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:07,320
nobody clicks on those buttons you can

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:10,410
leave them out one thing one click

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,000
people are there fractured they're

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,830
looking at them they're in the movie

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,860
theater look in there on the toilet

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,020
reading give them one button give one

00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,430
click that they one actually have to

00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,780
take they can't they don't have enough

00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,230
time they got a two-year-old running

00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:28,470
around or they have somewhere to go or

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:36,560
somewhere to be so yeah one action short

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:36,560
300 words good yes sir yeah you're next

00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,660
yes

00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:18,919
so WooCommerce we're talking about

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:24,440
WooCommerce where commerce does that do

00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:26,750
some of this email it's not pretty and

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,290
it can be challenging it's not super

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:35,140
robust what I like is jilt dos is

00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:39,980
excellent for e-commerce Delta G j alt

00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,540
they were WordPress developers and they

00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,510
wanted a better solution for their

00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,820
e-commerce so they built this Demark

00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:57,080
email marketing platform for e-commerce

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:59,030
and it's awesome and so you probably if

00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,280
you have a lot of sales or probably want

00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,660
to go to something like jilt if you

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,980
don't have a lot of sales probably

00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:08,600
WooCommerce is fine and I would not

00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,460
suggest like hooking up something like

00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:16,730
MailChimp and expecting those emails to

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,890
take a lot of this burden I would send

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,710
them from your e-commerce software and

00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,780
then your interested people who have

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,640
actually used the subscription form on

00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,750
your site that's where you send them

00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:40,580
from MailChimp and jilts cannot do that

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:42,940
jolt only does the e-commerce site it

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,940
could be

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,650
there are tons of people around here

00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,070
that can tell you about membership

00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:03,170
management I'm not I've never done

00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,390
anything like that but I think there's

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,710
member monkey or something like that I

00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:11,619
don't know there's tons of people I'm

00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:11,619
not a I'm not qualified yes ma'am

00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:35,240
okay so she's she's talking about she

00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:38,030
wants tools and automations that she can

00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,510
plug into her her site to get these

00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:49,960
types of sequences out and jolt Jos is

00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:54,370
awesome no it works with WooCommerce

00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:57,980
it's a plug-in and it's triggered by

00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,750
WooCommerce it takes over if you have

00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,940
WooCommerce it'll send emails from

00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,490
WooCommerce it'll take over those that

00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,020
emails and will send from there you

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:12,170
don't have to have who commerce in those

00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:13,610
emails yes it only sends emails in

00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,000
conjunction with people that have

00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,320
already purchased otherwise their

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,880
subscribers and interested and you have

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:33,350
to use an ESP for that email service

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:36,500
provider for that I so she's asking who

00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:38,570
to use if you don't if you're not using

00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,400
you work your e-commerce software to

00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:45,560
send out your emails so I love MailChimp

00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,640
and the reason why I love MailChimp is

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,760
because they're extremely

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,770
forward-thinking technology wise they

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,350
were the first ones that forced

00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:59,420
responsive emails so right after the

00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:02,720
Google started talking about anything

00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:07,160
responsive they forced everybody to get

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:09,050
a responsive emails these like a year

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,410
ahead of any other email service

00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:16,730
provider and they are always proactive

00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:22,690
on fixing bugs I mean I love them but

00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:22,690
I'm I get my living from them so

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:35,499
yep now no other email service provider

00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:38,380
for any other special niches except for

00:36:35,499 --> 00:36:41,999
Jill but no there's no reason to there's

00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:46,719
nothing that MailChimp cannot do and

00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:50,229
including complex automations there's

00:36:46,719 --> 00:37:04,630
nothing I can't make MailChimp do okay

00:36:50,229 --> 00:37:11,739
well I have another question yes yep

00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:14,589
they're two separate words okay so she's

00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:18,099
asking you have an e-commerce person in

00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:22,359
your in your email in their database you

00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:25,329
have your ESP email service provider you

00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:28,029
have your email in that database how do

00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:33,160
you make sure that you're not sending

00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:35,739
conflicting emails I haven't found a

00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,469
good solution for that yeah

00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:40,569
unfortunately well and here's the thing

00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:45,489
is you could you kind of know that when

00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:48,759
you first get them if they're going into

00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:51,339
a purchase there is a way that in

00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:55,239
MailChimp that if you have an e-commerce

00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:59,589
site you could say don't send to people

00:37:55,239 --> 00:38:02,559
who have purchased there is a filter

00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:05,019
that you can use a tag it's a filter

00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,819
it's a sequence that you can use and you

00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,829
can do it that way but I think it's

00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:11,920
really important if they signed up on a

00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:13,839
subscription form and they purchase they

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,359
want this information and that

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,619
information so I think it's really

00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:20,619
important to still send them that

00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:25,650
welcome sequence nurture campaign and

00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:33,489
drip campaign awesome all right we have

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:36,910

00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:40,859
about a CRM MailChimp is not a CR Men

00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,859
and don't expect to use it as that it's

00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:50,910

00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,869
