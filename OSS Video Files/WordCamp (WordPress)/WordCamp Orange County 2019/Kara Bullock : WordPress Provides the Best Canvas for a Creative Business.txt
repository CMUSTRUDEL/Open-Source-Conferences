00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,560
canvas for a creative business and it's

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:42,020

at a time so let's see here okay so who

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,760

husband's been super supportive of this

00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,840
journey of mine and I would not be here

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,590
today without him

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,070
and and my kids too so I have three

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,860
children

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:07,460

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll show you some of their my paintings

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,610
towards the end I started my journey in

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,430
my

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,810
career was an elementary school teacher

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,940
prior to that I wanted to be an artist

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,660
growing up I wanted to be an artist but

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,250
you know when I was going to school back

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,330
in the day it was like oh what are you

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,950
gonna do you're gonna go to Knott's

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,900
Berry Farm or Disneyland and do

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,910
caricatures and no I didn't want to do

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,900
that and so I went to college not really

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,530
knowing what to do and ended up going to

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,940
school to become a schoolteacher so I

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,040
studied child and adolescent studies

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,110
went on to get my teaching credential

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,550
from Cal State Fullerton and graduated

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,800
there in 99 and started teaching

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,190
elementary school I did that for ten

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,860
years and loved it and I also got to be

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,880
really creative there so that was nice

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:05,190
and I really just I love people I love

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,050
children I loved adults I loves the

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,420
interaction of being around people all

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:14,910
day and but I became a mom and after

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,160
having two children to being pregnant

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,320
with a third my mom said my mom was

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,690
taking care of our daughters while we

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,000
went to school and along was coming baby

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,650
three and my mom was like I'm gonna need

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,660
you to be home helping me and so I

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,700
thought well what am I gonna do so I

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,769
started teaching college online I

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,260
started teaching education courses for

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,120
different universities that offered

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,190
online programs for in child development

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,890
early childhood elementary education

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,170
anything education that I could teach

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,060
online I looked for those colleges and I

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,830
ended up with seven so I ended up

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,400
teaching for seven online school as I

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,970
stayed home ten years and was able to be

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,350
a mom

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:58,739
and and work full-time and my mom helped

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,360
me she would come over and help me in

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,670
the morning for a few hours I don't know

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,709
what's happening with my boring slide

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,190
show but it's gone away for a minute

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,739
there okay so while I was doing that

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,160
that I was reading hundreds of papers

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,260
every week and it became kind of boring

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,609
but the Internet you know was growing

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,350
and all these new things were being

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,640
offered and one day my sister texted me

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,620
and she says look what I did today and

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,820
there was a picture of this art project

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,860
that she had done some mixed-media

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,860
giraffe' that was like really

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,450
cool-looking and this isn't 2014 and I

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,920
was like oh my gosh how'd you do that

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,510
weird

00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,360
she's like I'm taking an online art

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:38,390
class I'm like online art class I teach

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,280
education online there's art online and

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,470
she's like yes so she sent me to this

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,340
website and I started I took an online

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:50,780
art class and my mentality has always

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,390
been I can do that so I took this class

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,630
and it was really fun and it just ignite

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,460
reignited my passion for art and I I'm

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,650
gonna be an artist I'm just gonna do it

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,440
you know it may not happen today but I

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,000
knew I was gonna be an artist and I was

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,800
gonna do it online because I had all

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,690
this a 10 years now at this time I had

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,690
had 10 years of teaching college online

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,680
I had taught I had built classes on nine

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:22,190
different platforms I'd used Moodle

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:23,510
eCollege blackboard angel canvas I don't

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,200
know though but I remember those ones

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,780
and so I knew how to build a class

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,120
online and I thought okay I gotta learn

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,730
how to be really good at art I got to

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,200
learn to I've got to have someplace some

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,840
kind of landing place some kind of

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,310
platform I didn't even think website yet

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,790
I'm thinking platform just because

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,990
that's what I you know was used to and

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,270
and I'm gonna have to have a following

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,490
like I knew I already I was starting to

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,840
realize I'm gonna need people to believe

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,150
they wanted to learn from me so I became

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,610
an artist and last year I incorporated

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,180
my business and I now own karbala art

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:08,060
online and in person so this is kind of

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:12,860
where we'll be going in so 2014 I shared

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,780
that my passion was reignited and so I

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,420
knew I had this experience creating

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,220
curriculum I knew that I could build an

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,290
art class online I just didn't know how

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,330
exactly I was going to do that and I

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,520
knew that I needed to get good at art

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,740
and so I was I mean I was just obsessed

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,660
once I got back into art it was like

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,040
staying up till 2:00 a.m. in the morning

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,490
I didn't care if I got sleep I was just

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,590
painting and creating art and still

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,960
teaching college for seven colleges so I

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,540
had about 15 classes anywhere from 12 to

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,039
15 classes at a time grading all these

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,930
papers being my mom

00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,210
and then painting at night and I like

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,800
sleep didn't matter it does now but it

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,199
didn't at that time I was just so

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,330
excited so I was like what was next and

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,699
so my goal I'm gonna go through goals

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,129
and this is an early 2015 my goal my

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,199
early on goals were okay I want to teach

00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:03,539
art online so what do I need to get

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,189
there and I knew like I said I knew I

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,899
was gonna need an audience that trusted

00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:08,610
me I at this time knew I was gonna need

00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,439
a website or some kind of landing

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,169
platform and he knew I was gonna need a

00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,550
good idea to make this happen because to

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,339
be successful you have to have a good

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,649
idea and it could be the same idea as

00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,999
somebody else you just have to figure

00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,990
out how that idea is going to work for

00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:25,830
you and how you're gonna make it

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:29,879
different so artists we say good artists

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,580
steal like an artist okay so you do

00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,319
everybody is inspired by somebody and

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,759
some people might say well somebody is

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,559
already doing that it doesn't matter

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,059
they're not you and you what you're

00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,319
gonna bring to the table is gonna be

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,240
different than that's somebody that's

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,249
already doing it so those were some

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,379
things that I knew I knew that I was not

00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:47,909
this you know I was inspired by some of

00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,459
these people doing different online

00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,930
classes but I was a different person and

00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,939
I was interested in different things so

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,219
I looked at what they were doing and I

00:07:53,939 --> 00:08:01,349
thought how can I do what they're doing

00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:02,759
the way I want to do it so I started the

00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,129
first thing I started doing I was on

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,370
Facebook I was kind of new to Facebook I

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:10,289
didn't really use it a whole lot but at

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,599
this time I started looking for some art

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:17,490
communities online and I joined several

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:19,080
quickly made friends I liked people and

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,639
so it's easy for me to kind of connect

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,580
and I want to know everything about

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,469
everybody and what they're doing and so

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,479
I joined a few art communities and then

00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,849
the online classes I was taking I think

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,360
I was in one it had an art community

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:35,310
with about 3,000 people in it and so I

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,110
started being active in there and

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,849
posting my artwork and people would say

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,880
you know start commenting just like how

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,380
Facebook works and started building

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,149
these friendships and then the

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,490
friendships would go off to you know in

00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,579
boxing and private messaging and and

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,980
really building more of a friendship not

00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:57,160
just this online community and so these

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,970
private messages

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,790
ended up beak turning into a small group

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,550
on Facebook there are about 20 of us

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,620
some one of the girls that I became

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,330
friends with early on she'd been living

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,210
and working as an artist for about 15

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:18,550
years at the time but nothing online she

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:21,610
did weekend art fairs excuse me she

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,610
would take like her art to like a like a

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,650
farmers market type or an art walk and

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,380
so she hadn't done anything online yet

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,550
and but she had a big following online

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,740
and she and I became good friends and

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,720
she created a small it was like the

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,310
artist professional guild or something

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,930
like that she put about 20 of us in

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,730
there and we all started talking about

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,670
what are our goals where what do we want

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:49,240
to be doing in the next year and I said

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:51,100
I want to be the girl that's got 3,000

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,990
people in her art class that's who I

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,270
want to be and everyone was like well

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,100
Kara I mean that's kind I said guys we

00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,630
can do this we can do whatever we want

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,760
you know I just got to work for it and

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,730
and follow figure out what do we need to

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:07,420
do to get there so I started building

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,890
these relationships and had this group

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,590
of 20 where I was feeling really

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:14,890
supported and had my husband supporting

00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,870
me and just kind of going crazy with

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,030
like all these ideas you know and I felt

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,770
like I had like way too many ideas and I

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,990
had time for which is still kind of I

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,310
just always that way anyways but it was

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,080
really you know and then I'm still

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,100
trying to manage these online schools

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,470
that I'm teaching for and my kids and

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,660
but I was like nothing was stopping me

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,130
one day I'm at school Brandon dove if

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,250
you're familiar with him he helps run

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,940
WordCamp and he and I our kids go to

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,610
school together

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,220
so we're chatting one day and he's got

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,540
this shirt on with this logo like well

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,330
what is that and he says oh it's

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:52,990
WordPress well what's WordPress he said

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:56,140
oh it's website platform I need a

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,050
website and he said I can help you so we

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:03,040
met for coffee and he helped me build my

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:06,820
website and I'm so thankful for just

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,180
that little conversation and WordPress

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:13,510
it for me immediately

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,990
it was intuitive for me it felt like it

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:19,390
was easy to navigate and it was another

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,860
canvas for me to create on so I mean I

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,760
have just as much fun working on my

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:28,690
website as I do on my paintings and so

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,380
that happened in 2015 and then I knew I

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:34,750
needed a good idea and I was

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,170
collaborating with these artists in this

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:43,480
small group and the one that had been

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:45,700
doing her art walk selling selling us on

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,410
the Art Walk I said you know let's do a

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,640
class and online class together you

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,610
don't know how to do the online class

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,970
but I do I can build this class

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,620
she had the following she had a lot of

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,020
people following that I knew would want

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,510
to learn from her and so he kind of

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,520
needed each other and then we said okay

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:07,060
let's and we said let's invite these

00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,860
other four people and then she's gone oh

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,510
I don't know she's kind of backpedaling

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,600
backpedaling and I said I'm doing this

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:18,760
so you either get on board with me or

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,590
I'm gonna move on so she said okay so we

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,810
decided to go for it it was called

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,490
angels among us it was all about

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,620
creating angels we put it out before

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,450
Christmas we thought people can create

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:33,400
Christmas gifts by making these

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:35,500
paintings and we put it for sale I think

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,690
it was August because I was I was away

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,610
on vacation when we put it on sale and

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,910
within the first day we had 80 people

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,770
sign up and it was like oh my gosh

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,690
people really want to do this you know

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,330
and 80 people is 80 people I would have

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,280
been happy of you know 10 but and then

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,930
you know by the time it went for sale we

00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,580
had 200 people I'd be by the time it

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,640
opened we have 200 people signed up and

00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,230
that was the you know it was pretty

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,690
incredible we were all really excited

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,940
and it was it was I it was a success and

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:10,180
it sold for about two years and till I

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:13,750
closed registration on that for other

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,030
reasons but that helped me to move

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,040
forward with another idea I knew it now

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,980
I thought okay I can reach out to other

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,140
people and how

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,360
and makes them believe that I can help

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,950
them and they can help me

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,210
I knew this networking was going to be

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:33,840
really important and so one of the

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,210
classes I had taken was a year-long art

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,760
journaling class and each week you would

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:41,070
get one lesson from a different artist

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:45,000
and there were about 25 artists in the

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:47,070
group so 50 lessons each artist was to

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,290
doing say 2 lessons and for the whole

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,420
year you would get one lesson a week it

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,860
would be uploaded on Monday and you

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:58,770
could go do your lesson and then you

00:13:52,860 --> 00:14:00,120
have your private Facebook group and if

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,350
your private Facebook group and then

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,790
that's where you show your work so

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,760
people can comment and you build these

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,220
relationships so I wasn't into the art

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,920
journaling I'm into drawing and painting

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,230
people because I love people and so I

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,760
was really into portraiture and

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,500
figurative art and so I thought I'm

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,180
gonna do a year-long class on portraits

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,180
there's nothing there's no year-long

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,910
class on portraits and so and most of my

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,760
friends that I had made relations with

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:31,230
online they were also portrait artists

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:34,980
so I reached out I drafted an email and

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:38,430
a contract and my idea and what they

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:42,630
would have to do and I started sending

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:45,600
it out to people said hey do you want to

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,110
be a part of this and everybody replied

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,200
with yes I don't think I had it he knows

00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:56,430
which was you know pretty incredible

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:59,480
feeling and that was in 2015 it's called

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:03,000
let's face it like let's face it face

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,310
but also let's face it like face your

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,980
fears of portraits so it kind of has a

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:11,190
little you know backend meaning to that

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,670
and I just now are in 2018 I've been

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:18,080
selling it since and at the end of the

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:22,080
first year I had a thousand students and

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,150
it was a pretty incredible thing so that

00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,520
was my good idea that really helped me

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,560
and the 20 people that joined me the

00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,570
first year helped me in a network and

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,530
start getting more students to my

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,500
website

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,390
so that I also helped them to start

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,070
living their life as a creative and many

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,500
people have been able to quit their jobs

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,110
or see stay at home moms because they

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,030
are also now teaching art online so it's

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,220
really been this whenever people say

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,470
thank you to me I'm like no thank you

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,540
because I couldn't be here without

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,450
everybody else that's been a part of the

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,190
journey so how did it WordPress help me

00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,110
with my first goal it gave me a

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,150
professional landing place for people to

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,610
come to so when people were on Facebook

00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,860
and said well you know how do I find you

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,650
karbala cart calm I would just say go to

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,060
karbala cart calm and you'll see

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,700
everything that I have to offer there it

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,430
I was able to create my virtual

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,380
classroom I was able to create detailed

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,150
registration pages so people could go

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,570
and see what are they going to get with

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:24,420
my class I could upload pictures I could

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,520
I also always have a bio for any of the

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:31,110
teachers in my classes so WordPress

00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:33,000
helped me to link my whoever is coming

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,950
to my abut website to other people as

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,410
well so it's helping the people who I'm

00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,690
who are helping me it's just this you

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,930
know constant helping I started my

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,220
newsletter thankfully back in 2015 you

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,780
know because everybody all thought we

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,220
were going to be able to run our

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,960
businesses off of Facebook but with

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,120
their algorithms you got to have your

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,310
newsletter so thankfully I started that

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,030
early on it was a place where I could

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:59,550
show a gallery of my artworks and at

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,370
this time I have an important note one

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,949
password per class at this time I did

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:08,939
not have accounts for students I just

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:11,250
had like a drop-down menu on let me see

00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:14,220
if I can put this down for a sec so

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,290
here's my website here and over here on

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,470
login there would be this drop down menu

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,819
just a long list of different classes

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,699
and there was a different password for

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,890
every single class so once I got up to

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,420
about 15 classes because I along with

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,220
let's face it and angels among us I

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,070
started selling my own personal classes

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,620
and hosting other people which I'll get

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,080
to in a minute but I started getting

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,730
emails daily I forgot my password to

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,020
angels among us I forgot my password -

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,880
let's face it I forgot my budding out

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm going oh my gosh I'm like spending

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,549
all day like your password is

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,990
you know and and I said to Brandon

00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:49,330
Brandon I need help

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,460
you know this is not gonna work for me

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,620
long term because I want to have like 50

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,080
classes 100 classes like this is long

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,770
term and he's like okay then you're

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:06,730
gonna need a different system so that

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:10,419
goes into my second goal

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,280
so my next goals and in 2016 I needed it

00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,470
to I knew I wanted to expand my art

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,539
school so what was that going to entail

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,740
I started researching other businesses

00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,409
I'm always looking at what are other

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:24,010
people doing like me that have an art

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:26,679
business like me how are they you know

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,870
how does it how is the navigation what

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,760
does it look like what are their

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,710
registration registration pages look

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,690
like I'm constantly buying art classes

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,870
to see what other art classes look like

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,610
because I know from my own experience as

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,289
an educator and teaching college online

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,880
it's really important for me that people

00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:45,280
could navigate my website and navigate

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,500
through their classes easily there is

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,320
nothing more frustrating than going to a

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,669
website that is not planned out well and

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,770
that you just don't even know where the

00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,840
heck you are and how to get to where or

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,720
okay now I'm in my class but how do I

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,429
get back to this or

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,080
you know what I'm saying like I just I

00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:05,440
couldn't I didn't want that and I can't

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,480
stand that so I'm always looking to see

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,750
is some somebody doing something better

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,970
than the way I'm doing it and and if so

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,110
what do I need to do to just to make you

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,260
know I'm always looking for a way to

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,929
make things better so I researched other

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,270
businesses I continued creating let's

00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,549
face it each year I have a few people

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,990
come back I've had about five people who

00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:27,970
have been with me the whole time just

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,460
because they've been supporting me and

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,230
and they have a big following so it's

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,490
been a great way to keep bringing more

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:39,340
people and then it's a it's an affiliate

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,750
system I'm I was using a junkie when I

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,030
first started I don't know if you're

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,600
familiar with affiliate systems but a

00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:48,429
junkie was not very expensive and and so

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,820
I was I basically had like a button to

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:53,950
PayPal and a junkie and kind of linking

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,539
those together I didn't have ecommerce I

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,240
wasn't used now I used WooCommerce I

00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,540
wasn't using that

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,070
yeah but that was also a goal so each

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,179
year with let's face it I have new

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:07,370
artists so I'm bringing in seasoned

00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:09,470
artists I'm with a following and then I

00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,840
also bring in artists who have never

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,150
ever taught online may not have a

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,730
following at all and just reaching out

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,610
saying hey you're an amazing artist do

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,630
you know what you can do online do you

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,940
know that you know oh I've got a

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,410
full-time job well do you know that I

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,360
used to have a different full-time job

00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:29,420
and now this is my job I mean there's

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,210
ways to do what you want to do what you

00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,210
love full-time you know and I just love

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,950
when people are like really Wow and then

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,530
they say yes and then they learn how to

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,320
do it and then they you know have their

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,750
own business or some people are not all

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,760
about running a business but I can help

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,950
them create a class and host it for them

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,650
and they can still make money and stay

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,270
home raise their kids or put their kids

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,260
through it through my one-girl she wants

00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,480
to put her kids through this private

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,720
school so her teaching online has helped

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,520
her to do that so I wanted to offer my

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,020
own personal classes more of those I

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,670
wanted to host other artists I wanted to

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,429
build I started building a resource

00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:14,720
library for my students where I linked

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:18,280
them to YouTube tutorials free a

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,179
copyright free pictures to use for your

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,980
portraits because that's another thing

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:24,010
you can't just go to Pinterest and paint

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,850
whatever you want especially if you're

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,650
painting something that looks like

00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,920
somebody you know there's copyright

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:33,890
issues so building an online

00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,390
photographer degraph library and then I

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:39,230
left a junkie and switched to

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:43,040
WooCommerce and then in April of 2016 I

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:46,640
also opened an in-person art studio so

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:52,220
how did WordPress help me with all of

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:55,340
this okay so going back to the 50

00:21:52,220 --> 00:22:00,050
passwords I decided to move to sensei

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:04,940
which is a plugin it is more for college

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:07,299
type classes if you're going to do

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:13,659
something that's going to have quizzes

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:16,210
and just more academic type classes on

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:18,909
your site sensei is a great plugin for

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,879
that and it worked for me for two years

00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:25,809
I say worked because I hit a wall with

00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:27,070
it but that's because I am really

00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,529
creative and I wanted to do something

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,570
that was a little bit more customized

00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:35,499
and then I switched to WooCommerce which

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,330
is awesome I like hate a junkie now but

00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:39,759
each idea was great for me it's time but

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,590
having integrated ecommerce is like the

00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,480
best because I can look at reports it's

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,100
so easy to say okay what did I make what

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,320
did my business bring in last month or

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,350
how many classes did I sell haven't you

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,059
know just and it's just all there on my

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,100
website so everything's in one place I

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:57,340
don't have to go to PayPal and make my

00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:00,840
you know link and then put make a button

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:03,639
on my website it's just so nice and easy

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,279
so that's been fantastic and WooCommerce

00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:08,619
also has a lot of really great plugins I

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:11,109
use follow up emails so if somebody buys

00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:13,389
a class and that was the thing with

00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:15,369
sensei - that was fabulous you buy a

00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:17,619
class it's immediately dropped into your

00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:22,570
account you have one user name one

00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:24,309
password and I didn't have to manually

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,220
do anything anymore everything was

00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:30,639
automated which freed up so much time

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,919
for me and I was able to paint more

00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:35,200
which is what every artist wants we want

00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:38,970
more time to draw or paint or whatever

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,559
it is you do and I no longer got

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,330
hundreds of the emails a day saying I

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,460
forgot my password because guess what if

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,309
you forget your password you just click

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,100
forgot password and you reset it so that

00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:55,210
those two things were just amazing for

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:57,399
me so what will made transactions easier

00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:00,820
oh it says translations but that's

00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:02,200
really transactions and then sensei

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,090
allowed me to create those accounts with

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,549
passwords my courses were more

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,279
professional-looking I no longer had to

00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:12,210
you know I was just kind of making them

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:15,240
with the editor on work on work

00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,860
so now sensei has actual lessons and

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,259
course home pages so I was really able

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,490
to make it look more like the classes

00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,679
that I used to teach when I taught

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,090
college had a sidebar that you could go

00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,919
to which is great so if you're in one

00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,840
lesson but you want to go to lesson 2

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,610
just click on the link and the sidebar

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,830
it takes you there it was just really it

00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,690
was really easy to navigate something my

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,070
students loved and sensei I'm still in

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,990
sensei but I'm transitioning into

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:42,059
something new as we speak but there's a

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,799
little progress bar so as you complete a

00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,440
lesson you can click it and you see this

00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,940
little you know you're a 25% through to

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,350
your class and I can't believe how many

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,299
people love that I mean that's not

00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,799
something that's really necessary for me

00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:55,889
but I can't tell you how many times we

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,190
were like I love seeing my progress okay

00:24:55,889 --> 00:25:00,899
so I had happy students it helped with

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,970
my registration for my workshops because

00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:05,070
again everything was linked you know my

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,460
my product was linked to my course which

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,080
was linked to will commerce so is

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,669
everything it's like you build your

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,249
course you build your product your

00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:16,499
registration page it's all linked just

00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:22,379
saved me so much time and it just looked

00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:25,799
so much better so then now my current

00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:28,019
goals and my goals from 2018 to present

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,940
I started focusing on branding I felt

00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,820
like I was kind of a little all over the

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:36,629
place on my website I had art journaling

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:39,749
I had mixed-media collage I have florals

00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:42,240
I have portraits but I started looking

00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:44,639
at what are people coming to buy you

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,740
know and WordPress I was able to track

00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:48,299
that because now I've got will commerce

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,269
so it was really easy for me to start

00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:53,399
tracking my reports and and I thought I

00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:55,320
want to be smart about my business you

00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,230
know I want to create things that are

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,730
gonna sell and I was finding that some

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,139
classes were selling really well and

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,360
others weren't so when I looked at what

00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:05,070
was really selling really well it was

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,309
always the portrait and figure classes

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,710
and it's because my demographic that is

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:14,460
coming to buy those classes and so I

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,649
started getting rid actually retired

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,480
they cook the art journaling classes and

00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:20,789
some of these other classes that weren't

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,470
selling so well and just started

00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,030
offering only portrait and figurative

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,400
art

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:29,360
and my business started doing even

00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:32,590
better and back to the hosting that was

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,150
one thing when I was researching other

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,770
businesses I found a couple businesses

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,750
that were hosting other artists and

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,810
basically that's I'm gonna reach out to

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:44,020
you hey I really like your portraits

00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,040
it's different than anything I've seen

00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,410
nobody's doing anything like that

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,300
I can mentor you I can teach you how to

00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,520
create a course I will sell it on my

00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:56,990
website and but wait and we'll sit we'll

00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:59,540
split the sales 5050 yeah I want to do

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,100
that most people say yes I do have some

00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,060
saying no and they say they want to try

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,620
and do it on their own and then

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,320
sometimes later on they come back to me

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,790
did my might go off maybe not they'll

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,410
come back and say are you still

00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,540

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:14,540
know usually I am - depends though

00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,370
depends sometimes I'm not for different

00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,840
reasons maybe my websites now and it you

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,940
know my school is in a new place and now

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,860
you don't fit with my school so no no

00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,090

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,970
over here they're doing the same thing

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:28,250
and you would fit with them so I always

00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,530
I have a lot of people reaching out that

00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,420
now they want to teach on my art my

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,630
online art school they're coming to me I

00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,430
get submissions and what I try to do if

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:40,370
it's not maybe they're not ready to

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:43,610
teach portraits but they're doing these

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:46,970

00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:53,750
say in a nice way something like that

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,940
doesn't fit with my agenda for next

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,790
yearfor let's face it but I think it'd

00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:03,100
be a great fit in life book which is an

00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:05,990
art journaling online class they go and

00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,030
they're in that class you know so I'm

00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,430
helping people to find what where

00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:14,710
they're fit is if that's a passion of

00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:17,510
theirs oh my gosh amount of time okay so

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,950

pixel jars helping me to do that as we

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,870
speak

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,840
I really had a vision for what I wanted

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:45,570
for my classes and so I you know said to

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,010
Brandon because we see each other often

being with our kids at the same school I

00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,640
said you know I really love sensei but I

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,679
feel like this these are the things I'd

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,510
like to do and he's like you're not

00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,510
gonna be able to do that with sensei but

00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:59,190
thank god you're with WordPress because

00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:01,440
you can do anything with WordPress you

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,559
just need a different plug-in right so

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,740
that's the best I have a friend who is

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,240
on Squarespace uses the same has also

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,520

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,250
business guess what they recently hit a

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,050
wall guess where they are now they're

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,130
with WordPress and I kept saying they're

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,260
like what are you using like I'm using

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,740
WordPress oh gosh oh my her husband

00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,420
hasn't hates WordPress I'm like okay I'm

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,300
like I don't know why cuz it's I mean

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,429
for me it's easy to use and he's like a

00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,320
website guy and I'm not so if it's easy

00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:33,000
for me it should be super easy for him

00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:38,220
and within a few months they had made

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,530
the move to WordPress and you know this

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,510
it's just the most you can customize

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,460
everything it's just awesome I love it

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:46,350
so we're moving a member press we're

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,630
customizing all my classes I said this

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,610
is what I want my class to look like and

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,520
they're like yes we can do that for you

00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,110
and I'm so excited because it's gonna be

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,280
ready in a couple I don't know two

00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,690
months I don't even know I don't know

00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:03,360
where they are on the timeline but I'm

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:06,290
so happy and and I and I want to offer a

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,570
membership so people now not just

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:11,730
selling classes you know $59 for a class

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,290
or whatever now you can pay X amount of

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:17,280
dollars per month and have full access

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:19,710
to all of the classes and you can have

00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,290
full access to the resource library with

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,090
all the images and full access to

00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,020
whatever those extra resources are to

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:31,320
really make the membership possible RM

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:33,900
membership desirable and and valuable to

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,270
whoever is you know wanting to buy it

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,560
but that is the way that a lot of people

00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,170
are headed is the

00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:44,790
membership and it's also a great way

00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:46,200
financially to kind of gauge more what's

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,720
gonna be coming in every month because

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,370
the currently I don't ever know what my

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,100
monthly income is going to be so

00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,510
thankfully my husband has a set income

00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,190
so we always know what his is gonna be

00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:59,790
in mine is just kind of like you know

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:02,010
you never know and then I'm starting to

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,510
submit to galleries I have being

00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,130
presented with an award tonight for a

00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,810
piece of the gallery so I'll be heading

00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:10,550
to that later tonight so that's exciting

00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:13,440
but the gallery that I'm in right now

00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:15,480
found me on my website so if I hadn't

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,960
had that website she wouldn't have found

00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,780
me

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,170
so my wordpress has just really helped

00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,370
me to do so many things for my business

00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:26,310
that I just never would have been able

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,320
to do without it and and it's just

00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,990
helping me to continue to grow one step

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,130
at a time and take baby steps and and

00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:39,420
just to do all the things that I want to

00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:46,590
do and I'm continuing to mentor and and

00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:48,330
so I'll show you quickly my site oh how

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,920
old WordPress helped and I already

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:53,880
really went over this I'm switching from

00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,770
sensei to member press I'm accept

00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,480
submissions for online if you want me to

00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,730
host a class for you if you want to

00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,770
apply to be and let's face it or I also

00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:05,040
accept submissions from photographers

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,790
for our online library of photos so if

00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,770
you're a photographer

00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:11,910
if that's a little side gig that you're

00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:14,040
doing you can submit a place for

00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,150
galleries to view art in my resume and

00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,660
then it's just going to be more

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:20,370
customized and and Branden he knows

00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,930
pixel jar they know I'm an artist and

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,940
I'm constantly changed my vision is

00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,680
constantly changing my arts changed a

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,290
lot every I'm just like I'm always

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,130
moving forward and I get bored so I know

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:34,440
that that will continue and so they've

00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,420
really put me in a place now where I can

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,050
continue to be super creative and

00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:42,600
continue to customize my things this is

00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:45,440

00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:59,380
gallery and one of those is being given

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,260
an award tonight I don't know which one

00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,150

think when when when I'm offering to

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,409
host somebody I think that they see the

00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:52,119
experience that I've had with developing

00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,040
curriculum and teaching I think that

00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:56,500
that makes me more desirable to work

00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,940
with but I absolutely do not think I

00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,800
don't think you even need a college

00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,800
degree to do what I'm doing

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,480
I think no I think there's well I mean

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,220
it really helped me but I think that

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,080
there's a lot of people that do it that

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,140
don't have any experience in that at all

00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:19,230
so I I don't think you need it but if

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,230
you have questions and talk to me yeah

00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,800
okay thank you everybody thank you so

00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,319
much

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,319
