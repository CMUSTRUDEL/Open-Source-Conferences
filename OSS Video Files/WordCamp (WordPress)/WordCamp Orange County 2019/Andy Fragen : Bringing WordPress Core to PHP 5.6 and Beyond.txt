Reagan and 'if Reagan has been using

00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:14,299
WordPress since 1847 in that time he has

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,660
been

00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:21,830
and hacker contributor plug-in developer

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:25,610
and hobbyist of WordPress his plugins in

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:35,390
the plug-in repository have over half a

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:42,350
million downloads and you friggin thank

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:46,550
you so much Dave so this is one of the

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,670
reasons I have a job and that I have

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,739
there's no shortage of work for me to do

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,300
people do silly things all the time

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:57,380
some people do stupid things all the

00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,040
time as I like to say there's no end of

00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:05,479
stupid people and because of that a lot

00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,540
of what I do professionally and what I'm

00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,969
going to be telling you about as far as

00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:18,229
WordPress is how to protect people from

00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:20,209
themselves the I don't get this he's got

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,119
kids all around he's looking at him it

00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:26,780
just doesn't make much sense and yet we

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,350
do it anyway you can't you know if you

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,929
try to make things more perfect or

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:37,270
idiot-proof there will be a more perfect

00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:41,029
idiot to figure a way around it there's

00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,639
truly almost nothing that is perfect

00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:47,810
finished or complete especially when

00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:48,859
we're talking about software right which

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,329
brings us to what we're really talking

00:01:48,859 --> 00:02:02,859
about in this case bringing WordPress

00:01:53,329 --> 00:02:06,859
core to PHP 5.6 and beyond currently

00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:10,039
well has a couple of weeks ago or so

00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:15,560
when I printed this out the stated

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:19,520
WordPress was on it goes from five point

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,220
two seven I believe on up I believe they

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,620
test on seven point four or at least the

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,300
PHP Knightley's so you can be assured

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,890
that at least core and trunk is is

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,600
running a

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:36,430
and will air out on those the proposal

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:41,560
to move to 5.6 was made by Matt and say

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:45,130
the word this last year and it was met

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,350
with resounding applause there's a lot

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,820
of us that have thought that trying to

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,840
maintain backwards compatibility with

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:56,230
PHP 5.2 kept us out of a lot of the nice

00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,240
shiny things that later versions of PHP

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:04,000
even 5.3 had to offer if you look at the

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,280
graphed the areas where I've got

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,190
highlighted there are a few 5.2 to the

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,070
5.5 which will be obsolete or which

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:16,030
would be no longer allowable to install

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:18,670
or update to WordPress 5.2 in fact

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:22,989
officially it's five point six point two

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:27,550
zero point twenty is what is your what

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:31,420
you can update to the if you look at the

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,100
other others the the big graph here 32%

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:41,230
it's probably a point with something

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:46,410
right okay if 32% is 5.6 18% is what is

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:48,970
it 7.0 both of those are our end of life

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,260
still receiving security updates the end

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,530
of life

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,510
I'm not sure where 7.1 is on the thing

00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:00,370
but the current recommended version is

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:02,709
7.2 no seven point three seven point two

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,150
is still is is it's not the currently

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,340
support currently active version and if

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:11,380
you go to WordPress their recommended

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:16,090
page says seven point three if you go to

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,229
the site health plug-in you'll get a

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,120
little notice to say you should update

00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:22,990
if you are on running a version of PHP

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,750
less than seven point three what this

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:30,130
means is about 20% of the current

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,290
installs on WordPress are going to be no

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,630
longer able to update to the latest

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:39,310
version of WordPress because they don't

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,570
have a current version of PHP fee up

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:46,030
side

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:48,460
is that by the end of the year the plan

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:53,440
is to increase the PHP version minimum

00:04:48,460 --> 00:05:00,880
to 7.0 which means everybody in green

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,510
needs to move farther in purple and what

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:08,280
benefits

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:10,810
well it's faster it's more secure you

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,380
can write more efficient more

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:17,050
object-oriented safer code you can

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:22,980
create better code quality and it's

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:26,800
faster you can improve your site speed

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:31,330
just removing from 5.2 or 5.2 any

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,910
version galore 5.6 from five point six

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:38,050
to seven to seven point one two to three

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:40,960
times the speed that improves its

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:45,310
efficiency that decreases your server

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,740
resources and generally makes you pay

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:52,120
less money to your hosting company if

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:54,300
you pay for resource so why would you

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,300
not

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:05,590
I attributed to the West Wing decisions

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,360
are made by those who show up I give her

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,160
an Aaron Sorkin credit for that because

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,320
I remember from the West Wing great show

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:18,340
I made a conscious decision to attend a

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:23,920
lot of the core PHP slack and the core

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:28,780
development slack meetings contributing

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:31,780
to open source is about a time DeVries

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,510
or the guy the gentleman who runs the

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,110
the Drupal project has a recent post

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:41,500
about this we're really he talks about

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,600
the biggest factor in open source

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,350
contribution is time management and do

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,980
you have time to allow to do this so I

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,960
made a conscious decision for some of

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:58,180
the things that I wanted to help with a

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,860
helping update core to PHP 5.4 5.6 and

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,810
beyond and so I made a conscious

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,250
decision to attend all the you know the

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,200
tendons minute slack meetings that I can

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,180
and be as active as I can giving

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,480
feedback and making patches and things

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,480
like that

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,130
contributing to core is different you

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,290
it's not like writing code for yourself

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,200
where oh this is good I've tested it it

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:23,740
works out the door not that it happens

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,020
that quickly but there's a lot of

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,360
different personalities involved there's

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,810
a lot of different cultures and language

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,480
barriers and code style that are

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:41,230
different and that need to be taken into

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:43,120
account the sometimes you can put in

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:47,710
feedback putting patches put in track

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:52,140
tickets and you get nothing and just

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:54,250
crickets no feedback no actual

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,980
notification that something's happened

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,870
and it can be a little disappointing and

00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:04,390
so as you participate you try to ping

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,910
somebody to gauge interest or give them

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,610
feedback or say hey you know this really

00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,410
it does help solve a problem and then

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,250
there could be like a flurry of activity

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,720
within

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:20,050
you know 10 12 hours and then more

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,360
crickets for the next 812 months before

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:28,120
something gets committed a lot of the

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,450
tickets and patches that were that we're

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:40,960
going to be talking about we're really

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:43,690
ready to go 45.0 but the core committers

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:48,220
in the core the core team development

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:51,010
team made Guttenberg the priority 45.0

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,290
so everything else got pushed back it

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,670
was a kind of chaotic timing and

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,110
contributing to trunk because there were

00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:01,030
several different branches and it wasn't

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:02,380
quite the usual method so I mean we just

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,420
kept you know so let's just kept writing

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,880
tickets and patches and stuff for trunk

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,620
it just kind of waiting for four five

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:14,650
point one to drop so that we could start

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:19,180
merging things in one of the things that

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:24,550
that happened we you know late one of

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:28,810
the big priorities in in the cirhappy

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,790
product project was this is the project

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,940
that that we that was codenamed

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,540
serve happy to bring all the the code

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:41,110
base safety measures if you will to help

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:47,740
help users from hurting themselves right

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:50,950
into core it started out in 5.1 with the

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,839
dashboard call-out well I'll show you a

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,940
picture of it in a little bit but this

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,770
basically got a lot of people and move

00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,510
the needle significantly in towards

00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:02,920
getting people to update to versions

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:07,830
over 5.6 from from 5.2 just putting a

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:11,200
dashboard notification in it registered

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,610
intent and so that every time everybody

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,980
went to the home screen their dashboard

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,510
they would see this if they had it if

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,839
you came up with an acceptable solution

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,060
they would query the the serve happy API

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,870
I think is what it's called

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,230
and it would go away the

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,749
[Music]

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:33,230
other thing that got installed in a 5.1

00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:36,970
was something I had was already helped

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,970
with the patch on it was already in the

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,160
it was ready for a 5.0 but kind of

00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:47,149
didn't get put in because of the focus

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,600
change was protection from installing

00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,720
plugins with incompatibility

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,100
requirements

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,209
now there's two basically and

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,220
compatibility requirements either

00:10:53,209 --> 00:11:01,419
incompatible with WordPress itself poor

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:03,290
or incompatibility with PHP and plugins

00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:06,139
register plugin authors and developers

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,779
register these compatibilities in their

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:11,389
readme file they're the ones that

00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:13,910
determine what the minimum versions are

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,529
what they're what they've been tested to

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,359
so what the with the requirements are

00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:22,689
and and where they want to set their

00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:26,509
plug-in it used to be that if you had a

00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:29,540
wordpress incompatibility it really just

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:32,649
didn't show it to you the it didn't show

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:36,819
the I don't believe it showed you the

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:36,819
plugin if you went to the install page

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:41,629
this is actually prevents you you know

00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,369
thereby preventing you from from

00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:46,189
installing this actually takes a step

00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,720
further and keeps you from having to it

00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:50,869
keeps you from having the ability to

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,149
install plug-in that potentially could

00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:56,389
break your site and give you a white

00:11:53,149 --> 00:12:01,249
screen part of 5.2 which is coming out

00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:08,239
next week May 7th happy birthday to my

00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:10,239
wife Rachel cherry hey Roy hi Roy

00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:12,799
because it happens all on our birthday

00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:17,389
it was supposed to come out the 29th it

00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:19,639
got pushed back a week what comes in

00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:21,529
that release is protection from updating

00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,629
plugins so not just stalling that

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:26,600
updating their having compatibility or

00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:28,309
clients and the inability to active in

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,339
protection from activating plugins that

00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:33,739
have those requirements you get those

00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,899
three things in place and plugins

00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:38,329
shouldn't hurt you anymore

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,350
so anybody's who's tried to install a

00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:40,970
plugin that

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,470
instantly activated or installed and

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,440
activated and white screen their site

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,060
they just shouldn't happen however if

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,800
you already have a plug-in installed or

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,570
something that does white spinner of

00:12:48,800 --> 00:13:02,480
your site the biggest change that they

00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:03,770
put in really kidding me it's on me was

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,300
the what they called a white screen of

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:11,330
death protection or the recovery mode

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:15,590
this was originally put in to 5.1 it was

00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:19,700
a late in a cycle there was a comment

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,860
about its potential and security with

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,970
how it was implemented and it was pulled

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,310
out and because it was pulled out all

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:34,850
these other things didn't didn't go into

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:38,960
the 5.1 he and it was good it was it was

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,700
one of the things about even writing and

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,950
putting a passion such a complex piece

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:48,440
of code was getting eyes on it and

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:51,410
finding out from a broader audience what

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,150
the potential implications are because

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,560
as we all sit there and do things in

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,810
front of our computer or in our own

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,910
little silo you can get a little tunnel

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,870
vision about the broader implications

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:05,120
and effects of things and I will tell

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,400
you that of all these things I wrote

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,950
code for most of the for all of them

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:15,020
except last one and the last one I could

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,690
look at the code and most of it was

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,840
written by Timothy Jacobs and Alan's

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,610
just Lera it was beautiful code but I

00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,470
couldn't really follow it and I was

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,240
having a difficult time figuring out how

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,600
exactly because it was just that deep

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,310
into the internals of things and we'll

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,150
go into what it does and how it does it

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:38,060
a little later on but it's now in trunk

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,920
it's ready to drop and it's one of the

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,350
it will be one of the best things going

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,840
forward to help users with their help

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,070
administrators with their sites not

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,750
necessarily users but administrators

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,520
because it's all about having the

00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,660
administrators be able to get into the

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,759
site again

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,880
so this is what the dashboard call-out

00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:01,399
looks like if you haven't seen it that

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:05,220
went up into 5.1 there's a notification

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:09,329
up in the dashboard that shows up it

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:11,519
says update your PHP Q this is a little

00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:16,829
little blurb lie and a little button to

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:21,449
link into into Y to light the link would

00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:26,160
take you to the update PHP page that's

00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:28,649
on the make that we're first encore make

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,930
that work better or the site with other

00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:34,860
reasons in and other information

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:37,709
regarding it we did add a couple filters

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:42,959
to that so that it would provide hosts a

00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:45,360
way to use their data so if you're

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,540
hosting if you're hosting a psych round

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,680
or GoDaddy or Bluehost or any one of the

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:55,250
other hosts and they have a specific

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,220
reasons for why you should update PHP

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,439
version they can use a filter and hook

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,449
into that and the button will take you

00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:04,850
to their page now this will

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:07,500
automatically have the filters in use

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:11,639
also give that little text blurb at the

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:17,339
bottom that gives you the original page

00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:21,720
and another filter in that area will if

00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:24,149
there's a page to directly the web host

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,670
has that here's where you update your

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,410
PHP from they can put a link in there

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,110
and just pop you straight from your

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:38,759
dashboard to their their page to update

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:41,930
your PHP when I said we directly talked

00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:45,509
about what the plugin developers

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:48,060
directly talked about and set their

00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:51,329
incompatibility requirements this is an

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:54,060
example of a plug-in header and the

00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:59,279
reader evening there's contributors tags

00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:02,610
the fee requires PHP so they or the

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,470
things requires at least is there their

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,110
header for which version of WordPress is

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:11,419
required

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:14,069
the new tag is the requires PHP tag and

00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:17,000
that's for the plug developer to set

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:21,510
what their minimum requirements are for

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,799
plug-in and the reason being is if

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:28,559
you're running a smaller version of PHP

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,530
the plug-in the main file the plug-in is

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,690
automatically read and parsed and so if

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:37,049
you have things that if you if it's name

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:40,169
spaced if you have short array syntax if

00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:42,419
you have null coalescing variables for

00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:44,250
that are in PHP 7 if you have things

00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,580
like that in your main file it will

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,280
fatal as it tries to load the file not

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,530
even run the file but just parse the

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:58,950
file you'll get a PHP parse error that's

00:17:52,530 --> 00:18:02,730
a fatal and so when the when in the

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,320
plug-in in repository or directory they

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,600
try to say failed gracefully

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,460
this helps people fail gracefully

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,390
because at some point we just stopped

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:16,260
them from doing it so really at this

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:19,530
point it's just an additional tag a

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,340
header tag in the in the readme of a

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,270
plugin

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:27,059
they have also required that additional

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:29,669
readme or additional tag in read means

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,409
for themes in fact I think recently

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:32,850
they've required all new themes

00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:35,370
submitted to the repository to have

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:38,340
readme files because they didn't used to

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,020
have them and my guess is a significant

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:46,020
percentage of them still don't have them

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:52,200
so the first one was preventing plugin

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:54,679
installation you may see where it says

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,270
untested with your version of WordPress

00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,460
normally will it'll say with your

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,460
version is compatible or it'll be say

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,780
income error may say incompatible and if

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,210
it says incompatible it won't let you

00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:10,440
install and if it says compatible it

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:12,960
will if this is untested it will because

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,750
usually untested because I'm working in

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,659
trunk and trunk has a higher version

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:22,700
number then obviously everything else

00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:25,200
does or what they're setting it for so

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,379
what we do is if the plugins are

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,049
incompatible it gives you the header up

00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:33,239
there that's in red that says your

00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:35,159
plugin is incompatible here's where you

00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:39,599
can go to learn more about updating PHP

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:42,239
and in the same way that if your host

00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,629
has provided an extra link and header to

00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:47,759
that that link will change to what your

00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:52,440
host provided and that other piece of

00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:54,179
text will also follow below you'll

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,259
notice that if you you'll notice

00:19:54,179 --> 00:20:02,220
especially in the second one a WPS hide

00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:07,440
login that the button is grayed out and

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:10,649
it says cannot install so it prevents

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,509
you can see it still in the in the

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:14,989
search pane and this all comes from the

00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,970
plugins search the search results field

00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:23,369
it is the most common place people look

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:28,080
for plugins I've been told so you can

00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:29,999
see it you can't install it you'll

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,570
notice that the other one this cannot

00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:34,710
update I'll get to that in a little bit

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:40,529
because that's already installed and

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:44,519
that's why if you click on the View

00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:46,259
details if you click on it see the more

00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,789
details link if you click on more

00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:52,999
details link what you get is an iframe

00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:56,159
the iframe there is it has the has the

00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:57,960
the plug-in details it will also tell

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,029
you what your compatibilities are as far

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,729
as your PHP compatibility or your

00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:05,249
WordPress compatibility those are the

00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:06,869
two lines office up there there's a

00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:08,639
warning because it's on trunk and it

00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:10,169
doesn't show it if there was an opiate

00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,999
if I wasn't on truck and I was on the

00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,559
regular version of PHP that one wouldn't

00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,090
wouldn't show up it would just wouldn't

00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,279
display it's not that it's incompatible

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,309
it's untested and because it's untested

00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,029
it just wouldn't show the same thing

00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:27,119
would probably happen if there was no

00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:29,330
requires at least tag shown in the

00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,330
readme

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,210
you get better information here because

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,310
now you know why what version of this

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,500
does does is what PHP does this require

00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:43,690
in this case there requires version PHP

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,940
seven or higher and it's compatible - it

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,750
requires these worthless version 4.1 or

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:52,330
higher those all come parsed from the

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,070
readme text readme text file which is

00:21:52,330 --> 00:22:01,120
why having that information in there is

00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:05,320
is important going forward if you go to

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,420
the the next the next so that was

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,320
unplugged installation the next feature

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,860
we implemented was on plug-in updates

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,470
so all those plugins you have already

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,260
installed in your site that have updates

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:23,590
and if those updates have potential

00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:28,600
consequences I know Josh here

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:31,300
somewhere had put a call out in caldera

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,280
forums that said you know coming coming

00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,260
up on our soon you you know you will not

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,170
be able to run caldera forums if you

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,060
want on PHP I think it's five point for

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:43,390
under five point four so if you have to

00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:46,120
update and things like this just help

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:52,330
developers not have to do things like

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:54,370
that and the what this so what this does

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,590
is it tells you there's an update

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,060
available tells you what the version is

00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,590
you will still be able to click and see

00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,360
the version details and the changelog

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:05,440
and things like that to see what you're

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:10,180
missing out on and instead of the update

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,580
now link where after shiny updates would

00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,490
update it in place there's another link

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,490
there's a link that says you know here

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:23,260
learn more about upgrading updating PHP

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:25,240
and again if your host has put in a link

00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:29,890
to to go to there as it would it would

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:34,660
show there if you are on the core update

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:37,750
page where you can update your plugins

00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:41,500
or themes or or core this is what

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,610
happens you you see your update you see

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,179
your plugin

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:48,279
under plugins it has an update available

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,870
but if you see the same message it says

00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,240
this update doesn't work with your

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:55,720
current version of PHP has a link to it

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,110
and there's no way to update it there's

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:06,490
no checkbox there's no way to make it

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:09,190
update from there if you click on that

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:13,570
version details again this is what the

00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:15,870
the iframe pop-up shows and you can and

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,010
you can get more information about what

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,750
incompatibility incompatibilities are

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,789
because that's the location where where

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,320
it will say what the required PHP

00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:29,380
version is and again you get the same

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,120
dialog notice warning and to tell you

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,590
what's there and you can look at the

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,159
change log and see what you're missing

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:44,830
out on and again if you look the Update

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:47,980
button is grayed out and inactive the

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:53,769
third part of keeping people safe from

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:57,549
plugins was plug in activation the if

00:24:53,769 --> 00:25:00,519
you try to activate a plug-in you will

00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:03,220
get a WP error and a WP error screen

00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,200
that will give you this message it says

00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,570
error current PHP version does not meet

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,340
the minimum requirements for in this

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:18,010
case WP section manager which we saw the

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:19,600
PHP version was 7.0 v all you have to do

00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,090
is hit your back bucking button in your

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,700
back to the same place but your plugin

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:28,059
won't want to activate or the plugin

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,870
won't activate so third kind of method

00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,870
of protection

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,589
[Music]

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:48,690
the white screen of death error it's

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,790
gotten a white screen of death so

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:54,020
everybody knows what it is right there's

00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:57,210
some PHP fatal for whatever reason right

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,310
and all of a sudden you're looking at

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:02,640
your website web page and it's just like

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:05,640
there's nothing there and unless you

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,980
have WP debug set you won't see any

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:13,620
error message because the default does

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:18,500
not display errors in line and that that

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:23,580
will be that now what you will see

00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:24,870
through this improvement is a message

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,040
that says your site is experiencing

00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,690
technical difficulties

00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:34,350
please check your site admins email

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:36,300
inbox for instructions so if you're just

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,550
alright if you're a user your users are

00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,230
still gonna see they're gonna see a page

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,520
like this and they're not gonna be able

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:55,920
to go any further if you're the

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:59,250
administrator essentially says howdy

00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,080
since WordPress 5.2 there is a built-in

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,060
feature that detects when a plug-in or

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,100
theme has the fatal error in this case

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,370
WordPress caught the error in one of

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,800
your plugins gives you a plugin named

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:14,490
serve happy testing okay so it was my

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,970
own first of all please visit your web

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:20,970
site and see if you find any visible

00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,230
issues then contact your host for

00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:26,130
assistance investigating this issue

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,810
further if you need to if your site

00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:31,740
appears broken and you can't access your

00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:34,830
dashboard here's a link you click on

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:39,120
this link you'll go to login page to

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:42,560
enter recovery mode the link is if once

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:46,160
you go in to click the link and login

00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,900
that link is no longer valid once you

00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,760
the link if you don't login the link

00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,760
expires after a day

00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,960
if the air still persists let's say you

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,090
don't get the air after a day before a

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,200
day it just regenerates another link

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:07,890
another email so the idea is not to spam

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,940
it many users email boxes with an error

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:17,610
message every hour or every 4 hours or

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:19,680
less than every once a day and it tells

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:25,470
you that the site link will expire in

00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:26,640
the day once you log in to the site the

00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,410
back end now you're the administrator

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,630
you've got that email you log in the

00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,130
back you will be greeted by the

00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,370
dashboard with this this is you are in

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:38,130
recovery mode there may be an error with

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:40,920
a theme or plugin tags the recovery

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:44,809
remote logout or use a little button up

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,809
top there for just exit recovery mode

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:52,860
you can find out about your failed

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:55,710
plugins by going to plugins screen so

00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:59,940
when we go to the plugins screen this is

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,620
what we see we see our plug-in and we're

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,220
given two options we can deactivate the

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:07,080
plugin or we can resume and see you can

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,059
fix what we think is fixed and you know

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,000
fix the little plugin and hit resume and

00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:15,660
see if it loads up again and see if it

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,960
works it says it just failed to pause

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,880
and is paused in the dashboard so what

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,400
happens is the plugins just past pausing

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,510
the dashboard your users will still get

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,770
a fatal on the front end of the site

00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,760
still get a white screen on the front

00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:34,730
end of the site so that nothing is

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:34,730
really fixed if you deactivate this and

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:40,770
go back to your site if you have another

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,470
error or another fatal it will show that

00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,390
and it will kind of continually go down

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,940
the line until you don't have any more

00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:50,550
so if you have sequential errors and

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:53,309
you're in certain plugins or code that

00:29:50,550 --> 00:30:00,500
they will show up as they are the

00:29:53,309 --> 00:30:03,440
precipitating cause is it perfect

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:09,150
no not really

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:11,550
I'm the one of the largest problems that

00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:14,040
that we built into it is for those

00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:16,890
people that don't have or have not yet

00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:23,670
put those headers into their readme

00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:25,560
files if you don't have that header just

00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:29,730
like happens in in every version of

00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,640
WordPress previously the plugin gets

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:35,850
activated the plugins can get installed

00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:40,260
the plugin can that get updated you're

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:47,510
basically on your own for those errors

00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:50,720
if there's they happen at some point

00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:53,880
they're probably going to reverse that

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,540
which means that if you don't have those

00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,670
values described in your read knees the

00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:05,600
plugin may not activate may not install

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:07,710
and may not update and of these 65,000

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,930
plugins or so that are in the directory

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:13,550
my guess is quite a number of them

00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:16,080
probably don't have that header and will

00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:20,840
really stop being able to get updates

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,840
and stop being able to get installations

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:28,380
is it a breaking change technically I

00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,610
mean if you can't install something that

00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,190
you used to be able install is that

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:35,070
breaking yeah does it really break

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,140
anything no I mean all this is a comment

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:42,000
and they're in there reading in their

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:43,470
text file to make it work have we done

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,660
it you know the next what's the net

00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:49,880
what's next right themes

00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,880
I'm just we're still working through how

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:57,150
have the repository and how the pages

00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:01,710
show that data for themes but my guess

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:03,840
we can figure it out by 5.3 or so all

00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:07,740
those things will be in place for for

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,600
themes so that any any theme you want to

00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,580
activate or you want to install or you

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,630
want to update is also going to have to

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,390
have that require

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:20,100
in its readme file you know it's more

00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:22,020
problematic for themes because I can't

00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,180
say from day one but for as long as I

00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,180
can remember plugins have required a

00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,790
readme file that's where people go to

00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:31,260
get you know that the data on the thing

00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,600
of what does it do what's the

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,820
description what's everything else

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:39,450
themes it's only recently that they've

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:42,690
required the readme file so they're a

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:49,410
little behind they now do any any new

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:51,060
theme that comes in requires it and so

00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:54,900
at some point they're gonna have the

00:32:51,060 --> 00:33:00,150
same issues and problems can we make it

00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:04,020
better well we have a track ticket up

00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:07,020
for adding an extra header to the plugin

00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,540
file so in your main plugin in your main

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,250
plugin file there what there will cut

00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:14,520
there what are called single file

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,200
plugins they don't have directories they

00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:21,110
don't have other folders they don't have

00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,040
read needs a lot of these are very

00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,200
personalized plugins that people put on

00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,480
their sites if their developers though

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,970
where they put for their clients that do

00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,140
one specific thing or one group of

00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,760
things and they're not in the repository

00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,860
and if they get updated they either get

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,270
updated in place or they get updated by

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,610
the developer and thrown back up on the

00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:46,650
site but since they don't have read

00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:49,080
knees there's no way for this code at

00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:53,190
this time to identify that they have any

00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:56,460
incompatibilities there's a patch

00:33:53,190 --> 00:34:01,040
involved it recognizes the addition of

00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:04,380
two headers to the plug-in header file a

00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:10,170
requires WP header and it requires PHP

00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:13,110
header and so that those are parsed read

00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:16,680
in and so that the same sorts of

00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:19,530
compatibility checks can be done for

00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,660
those types of files often those types

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,940
of plugins there are probably a number

00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:26,210
of premium plugins that don't have

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,970
standard readme text file

00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:31,420
they may hit they may exist on github

00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:34,060
somewhere and just have a readme MD file

00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:36,560
so they can see it

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:40,760
those types the plugins are all going to

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,500
be affected if the they're not gonna be

00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,160
able to have compatibility checks test

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:48,950
it against so we're still digital

00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,720
discussion about that and obviously as I

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:54,560
alluded to before the last you know the

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,870
last pieces if those headers or those

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,550
files don't don't exist either in the

00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:03,830
plugin of the readme if that other tract

00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:06,290
ticket goes through we allow it it's a

00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,470
it's a passive it's a passive allow if

00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,640
you haven't done the work just there was

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:15,700
the same way everything happens

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:18,020
currently it's allowed to go through now

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:23,000
at some point date like I said at some

00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:24,740
point they may not and you're gonna hear

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,670
from if you maintain sigh how many

00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:30,290
people maintain sites for clients I

00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:32,480
guarantee you'll hear from them because

00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:34,310
all of a sudden they won't be able to

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,200
update plugins the plugins that they had

00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:38,120
will stay and you'll stay on because

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,220
they're already active but they won't be

00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,990
able to update things they won't be able

00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,420
to activate things that they haven't

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:49,900
been activated they won't be able to

00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:51,950
install new things it's it will be loud

00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,900
now the upshot is there's a lot more

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,460
work to do right because you could

00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,980
always probably just create the readme

00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,910
Dex text file but the compatibility is

00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:05,300
in for it and you know package it up and

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:08,290
change it to allow for those things this

00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,290
just makes it a little easier

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:17,460
as I said before I'm sure you can't read

00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:18,960
if I'll read them off I was very

00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,930
intentional about trying to set aside

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:27,030
time to go to the peak or PHP slacked

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:29,280
meetings and participate and to write

00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:33,680
patches and code and comment on track

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,680
tickets and help where I thought I could

00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:41,360
this is not one individual or any most

00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,310
project there's there's a lot of people

00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,560
that were involved in this and getting

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:51,690
this forward some of the primary

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,430
contributors of the the the primary

00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:58,010
person that seems to have taken off and

00:36:53,430 --> 00:37:02,280
run with the core PHP is Alan so Sarah

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:06,870
Elaine is a fantastic developer not a

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,460
core committer at least not yet but he

00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:12,030
is basically shepherded this whole

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:15,000
project through he in felix arts who is

00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:17,160
a cork you later and Sergey Birkhoff

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,340
surgery is a machine I'm not even sure

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:24,030
exists I think it's a robot it it is

00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:28,970
truly amazing to to me how quickly he

00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:32,280
will see a patch appropriately tag it

00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:35,370
put a milestone in it and do sorts of

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,060
things that just happen within minutes

00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:41,130
of the patch being even uploaded and

00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:43,020
he's in Europe and I'm here in

00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,730
California and I can tell you we're not

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,030
even closed on the tank same timezone

00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:49,590
but it doesn't really you know and maybe

00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,240
it's just that I seem to be doing some

00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:53,060
of this stuff late at night and so it's

00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,760
a little better for his time something

00:37:53,060 --> 00:38:00,330
maybe but lately I've been seeing things

00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,250
that I put in and they just get they get

00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:05,420
but they get there the little milestones

00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:08,630
and and stuff from on the track

00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,630
incredibly quickly

00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,220
Jonathan de Rozier who just gave a talk

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,480
about what makes the good core

00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:21,690
contributor has really been instrumental

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,330
in getting a lot of these track tickets

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,680
committed

00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:28,670
and in doing that and just you know

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:31,280
basically helping to look at these

00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,390
tickets and participate and get things

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,730
going

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,960
it's none of this no because no stuff

00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,360
gets in the core without a core

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,040
committer right you have to have a core

00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,040
committee to review your stuff and look

00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,990
at it the other thing about the other

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,180
thing about surgery when he commits the

00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,920
tickets I'll look at the commit and see

00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,200
what the code was to actually committed

00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,910
and like I didn't quite write it that

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,220
way in my patch and you try to figure

00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,140
out what the differences are for why

00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:02,390
they do things and sometimes you can see

00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:04,070
it and sometimes I just don't know it

00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,440
all still functions very similarly and

00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,730
sometimes you think oh my god that was

00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,410
just so clever there was just so much

00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:14,540
less code to put in that way yeah I just

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,510
quite haven't figured out how their

00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,890
minds think and some of these things one

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,780
of the patches I submitted for one of

00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:25,250
the things I submitted a second patch

00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:27,110
because I saw how surgery had fixed the

00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,160
patch the first time around and I said I

00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:31,250
think this is going to be more in

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,510
surgery style so I uploaded that one and

00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,500
that seemed to be the one that got

00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:38,180
committed without much change Allen's to

00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:42,320
serve up the top and Timothy Jacobs who

00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:46,100
I alluded to earlier wrote the vast

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,470
majority of the white screen death error

00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:52,070
protection recovery mode error

00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:56,360
protection code obviously two brilliant

00:39:52,070 --> 00:40:00,230
developers he I just can't say enough

00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:03,200
about them everybody else

00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:09,970
Darren ether joy Reynolds Johnny Harris

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:13,640
Jenny Wong and Pascal thanks

00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:16,430
we're instrumental in feedback every

00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,870
once in a while you know everyone's want

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,120
to get feedback from people and you're

00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,800
like I don't quite understand what

00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,080
you're saying I had one of those

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,120
interactions with one of my with one of

00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:30,710
my tickets it involved the plugin

00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:32,870
activation prevention and the fact is I

00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,200
was wrong I mean I didn't do it

00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:37,230
correctly and and

00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,990
the way they had the way I was was

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:42,839
recommended I look and do was right I

00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,710
just wasn't quite understanding what

00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,599
they were telling me because they

00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:48,119
weren't telling it to me in necessarily

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,160
a language that I understood and till so

00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,780
else jumped in and said hey it really

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,530
does work and here's kind of a code

00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:58,410
example for it and like oh my god let's

00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:02,160
make it so much easier the one thing

00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:06,690
I've found about contributing to core is

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:09,810
they there's a lot of they're very

00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:13,589
conscious about keeping compatibility

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:16,829
and support going forward fear was

00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:19,710
there's much more direct change of core

00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:23,670
files rather than adding filters adding

00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:27,869
hooks to change something and in

00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:30,359
creating new functions to it's part of

00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:32,730
the patches now I have to tell you in

00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:34,530
this whole sort of happy thing there

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:38,430
were a lot of new functions that when

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,750
the functions PHP we you know some of

00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,190
them we thought kind of hard for and one

00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,680
of them that I thought kind of hard for

00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:46,530
was there's a general function for his

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,280
WP version compatible and is PHP version

00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:53,040
compatible they take a parameter

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:57,109
parameters just the version number so if

00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:04,050
your requirement is that your plugins

00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:06,270
are on PHP version 7.1 and you want to

00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:10,680
fail gracefully for those people you can

00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:14,730
just put is PHP version compatible paren

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:18,980
and then 7.1 and if it is load the code

00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:21,119
if not compatible return and exactly

00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,770
keeps people from failing their own

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:29,819
sites failing their own plugins or

00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:33,000
causing issues potentially I learned a

00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:34,560
lot about PHP and coding and stuff by

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,420
doing my own projects this is one of

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:41,960
them a lot of the ideas behind the next

00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,970
last track ticket and having those

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,430
plug-in headers for testing

00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,809
compatibility came from

00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,980
my work on github updater I've been

00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:50,760
supporting that and that's not what I've

00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,069
been doing

00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,930
as far as a compatibility test for

00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:59,460
updating for years now and I just found

00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,440
it works pretty easy it's just an extra

00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,440
comment adding extra comments to come

00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:14,099
Who am I it's my date it's okay I'm a

00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,740
developer that last plug-in you can find

00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:19,380
me at any of those places and yeah my

00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:47,700
this is my day job I am I'm a trauma

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:49,770
surgeon anybody have any questions there

00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,930
have not so there have only been very

00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,450
few PHP functions that have been

00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:57,599
deprecated my create function has been

00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:59,280
deprecated but create function was

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,220
basically put in place so that you could

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,319
write an anonymous function and you can

00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:08,359
write an anonymous function from PHP 5.3

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:14,099
and it's only been deprecated from seven

00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:16,170
so a lot of those things aren't it there

00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:17,940
is nothing that stops the plugin

00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:24,630
developer as you saw from writing code

00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:28,410
that is requires PHP 7.3 ok it will work

00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:30,630
in core it will work in PHP 7.3 and if

00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:33,480
you set those requirements that's what

00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:35,040
your users have to use otherwise you or

00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,170
your plug-in will either exit gracefully

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,000
fail gracefully or it won't be

00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:44,910
installable updatable or activatable I

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,049
don't think it's an issue with how

00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:50,670
Korra's code is chorus code I mean as

00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:54,359
far as making a plug-in I think the

00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:56,250
problem that a lot of developers from

00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:59,970
the outside looking at WordPress chorus

00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,480
is that we have been very we they we the

00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,980
core commit

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,750
has been very intentional about

00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,990
maintaining backwards compatibility

00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:10,770
as such they don't use shorter race in

00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:13,080
taxes which came in 5.4 they don't use

00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:16,170
array dereferencing which came in 5.4

00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:19,290
they don't use name spacing right which

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:21,200
came in 5.3 do I think all of these

00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:25,920
things would help tremendously

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,630
absolutely but it's you know of course

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:35,510
primary philosophies let's not break

00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:35,510
