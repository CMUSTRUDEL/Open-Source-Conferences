00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,660
is the most beautiful room I have a

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:26,740
spoken spoken into and it's incredible

00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm stoked I feel like a rockstar this

00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,060
is really really good and this is a

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,129
fantastic work camp this is my first

00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,739
time I work in Posey and I already love

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:38,140
it so thank you for coming to my talk

00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:41,379
but I know there's a super busy schedule

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,569
so I'm particularly happy that you

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:45,249
picked my talk so what are we going to

00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:48,609
talk today we're gonna talk about

00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:52,319
securing WordPress without coding skills

00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:57,010
is there anyone here a security expert

00:00:52,319 --> 00:01:02,399
don't stay here or if I say something

00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:05,440
completely wrong please say it alright

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,780
so my name is Francesca

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,730
as you can hear from my accent I'm

00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,690
obviously not from around here

00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:18,220
from Torino Italy I own more than one

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:21,450
t-shirt that it's very convenient to

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:25,030
have like a an outfit like Steve Jobs

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,370
that people will recognize it so in my

00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,410
case it's a blue shirt with pink glasses

00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,060
wherever you go to a work camp you'll

00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,210
find me wearing this thing so you'll

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,800
know who I am as Steve say I'm the

00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,870
WordPress community manager at side

00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,060
ground the international web hosting

00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,920
company and before doing that I was a

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,010
freelancer making websites for other

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,710
freelancers mostly so giving back to the

00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:51,310
WordPress community is basically my job

00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:55,990
it's part of my job description and I'm

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:59,830
gonna brag because I am I worked hard to

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:04,420
get here right so I'm like bragging I'm

00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:07,870
not a modest person so what I love is

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,479
that having this job allows me to do the

00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:14,409
thing that I love the most in life which

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,650
is the sharing knowledge in Italian we

00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:18,790
say when you have money that you need to

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,420
enjoy it because you

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,219
cannot use it to and I don't know the

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,579
word in English but you will not put it

00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:29,530
in your coughing right alright so you do

00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:30,969
the same with knowledge just share it

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,709
it's the most wonderful thing in

00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:35,260
Woodward and I think where it games are

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:37,269
amazing because each one is a story to

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,540
tell each one of us has something to

00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:43,120
give to the other person in the room so

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,939
this is why I love going to work camps

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,829
around the world and sharing my

00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:52,299
experience sometimes my failures

00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:55,209
sometimes my successes and what I

00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,799
learned from it and sometimes I get to

00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,019
share things that I learned from my

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,019
colleagues at sycron so this talk it's

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:05,379
actually a bit of a mix of everything

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:09,730
from my previous life as a website owner

00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:14,079
and designer developer plugging

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:17,260
installer and and my experience now with

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:20,620
a big hosting company behind it so I'm

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:24,790
obviously not a security expert but I

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,769
think that so becoming a security expert

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,280
is a different job than making websites

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:33,909
okay it's a very different job than

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,659
making websites but I think as web

00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:41,199
professional of any kind we owe it to

00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:43,900
ourselves and our customers to make the

00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:47,949
web safer for everyone because everyone

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:50,079
has to get something for out of it if

00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:53,590
the way be safer is safer for everyone

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:57,370
and also if you knew if you know enough

00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:00,190
it will prevent you from making costly

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,939
mistakes which is what this talk is

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:06,790
based about it's my mistake and how I

00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:08,769
solved in and how much it cost it so we

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,680
will not talk about technical stuff what

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,870
is your name Josh if you have any

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,440
technical question josh is there man

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,840
and is here if you have technical

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,840
questions about anything related to side

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,240
ground come look for me and after this

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,539
we're gonna pink my colleagues that know

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,460
about security and technical stuff so if

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,080
you have any really technical stuff josh

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,389
is there men or you come see

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,240
and we're gonna ping customer support

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,009
and they're gonna reply but today so

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,349
what I like to think of myself as a

00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:43,900
common-sense dispenser I'm really like

00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:48,610
full of common sense that's my my

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:52,569
superpower I think and I learned this as

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,400
I said from my experiences and I hope

00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:56,979
it's gonna be helpful for you too if you

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,750
don't want to become security experts

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,110
but you want to make the website for

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:05,319
everyone so how I learned this during my

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,620
time as a freelance web designer there

00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:12,150
was one particular accident that led me

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,669
to research security a little bit more

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,860
and the key word here is awareness again

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,110
it's not becoming a security expert but

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,259
know enough not to be dangerous let's

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,509
say it's like this so one of the web

00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,150
site that I manage this cheap UB that

00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:32,289
was mentioned so cheap UB is a multi

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:35,530
author website we're now over 80 people

00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:37,949
writing for it so imagine 80 people

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,650
having access to it creating their own

00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:44,610
username and their own password and so

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,840
at some point this web site got hacked I

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,449
suspect because someone had as a

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:54,759
password one two three four I cannot

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:58,419
prove that so the web site got hacked

00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:01,120
and we got a seasoned business letter

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:06,210
from an American lawyer that asked us to

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,330
remove false advertisement that was

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,490
redirecting to a well-known

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,590
pharmaceutical product and we're like

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,620
what

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:21,789
what a bunch of ladies reinventing our

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,069
career and writing about it you know

00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:26,319
like we talked about marketing and

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:30,789
personal branding and sometimes called

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,319
pajamas to work from home with what are

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,190
you talking about

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:40,810
and then we scan the website and we

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:42,100
realized that content was added to our

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,080
pages as

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:51,280
hidden content with advertisement for a

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,770
pharmaceutical product needless to say

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,620
we were very scared because you know

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,480
we're in Italy suddenly we get a season

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,630
disease letter from an American lawyer

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,660
like ah are we gonna go to jail are they

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,180
gonna revoke my visa I don't know it was

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,980
kind of scary so we managed to get rid

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:16,060
of that and obviously we had no idea our

00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:20,380
website was compromised and we also got

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:24,160
a sense of false security because we

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,590
installed a plug-in at the time not even

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,240
a plug-in actually a module of a plug-in

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:33,790
that was supposed to keep intruders out

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,540
so we're like we have a plug-in we're

00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:41,190
safe no unfortunately that's not how it

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,670
works this is like the most used

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:47,920
sentence ever when we talk about

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:50,980
security that says that security is a

00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,650
process and not a plug-in so even if you

00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,950
installed a security plug-in which

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,820
obviously will help there are things

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,290
that you need to do that are your

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:06,040
responsibility and that will help

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,930
immensely and I learned this as I said

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,610
first hand because I thought all right

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,780
we have a plugin we're good to go

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:15,820
no that's not how it works so security

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,550
is a process

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,610
security is a state of mind and it

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,340
starts even before you create your

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:28,600
website I would say you have to get into

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,520
this security mindset safety I would

00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,180
like to say even you know it's not just

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,340
about security is about safety

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,770
even before you start your website so

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,419
and this is where josh is going to help

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,450
me hmm

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,610
let's do a bit of a background very easy

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,090
we're not gonna get into technical stuff

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,490
as I said who is doing this attacks okay

00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:54,370
so we talk about attacks

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,029
King and if you're anything like me you

00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:03,490
imagining those hackers as neo in the

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:08,200
matrix with the 25 keyboards 75 screens

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:10,140
typing like that and going to my website

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,550
that's not how it works

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,640
apparently I was very disappointed what

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,339
I realized that so there are more or

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:23,290
less three bodies that carry out attacks

00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:25,330
one is neo for matrix or Janna Reeves

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,630
did another movie where it was an actor

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,680
the net I don't know it's a very old

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:35,589
movie anyway so he was there so when

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,760
it's a person those attacks are very

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:44,620
rare and they attack very high

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:47,020
visibility targets think FBI think you

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,240
know government side so think banks of

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,540
things about these political parties

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,910
think about this kind of thing that

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,950
hacker will not attack Francesca Morano

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,950
dot-com he doesn't know I exist

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:04,180
many he that is not really interested in

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:06,850
my website so per human attacks are very

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,610
rare are very sophisticated are probably

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,910
the hardest to detect because they're

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,209
sophisticated and then we have boats

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:20,709
both our programs that are written by

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:23,950
humans but they potentially hit lots of

00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:26,770
work websites at the same time with

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,279
usually one specific thing like you know

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:34,570
getting your password and going to the

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:36,850
the admin area whatever they're not very

00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:40,149
sophisticated but they're very efficient

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,839
because they can hit a lot of websites

00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:46,600
at the same time and even more effective

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,750
than bots are botnets which are as you

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,910
can imagine network of boats which is

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:57,370
multiple computers attacking so imagine

00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:00,730
large-scale attacks hundreds of

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,829
thousands of websites coordinated by

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,610
computer that is usually observe it and

00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:08,040
usually called CNC control

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,220
command and control and those are deadly

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,320
because they they hit hard they go to

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,900
millions of website at the time they're

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,580
not very smart but they're deadly

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,460
because they they attack a lot of

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,870
websites at the same time now you have

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,640
to understand that it's nothing personal

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,470
especially if you're Francesca Morano

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,820
calm if you're FBI don't come it is

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:32,940
personal calm it's not personal

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,770
what do hackers want because I remember

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,500
when we were when we got hacked it was

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,140
like what did they want from this ladies

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,650
like we're a bunch of ladies writing

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:46,830
useful free content why are they

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:50,190
attacking us they don't care so what do

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:53,130
hackers want from your new website that

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:57,089
just you and your mum read they want to

00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:00,150
gain control as admins of your website

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:04,740
so they can write files and they can

00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,029
gain control to do stuff what kind of

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,730
malicious stuff

00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:12,959
what kind of stuff for example sending

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,810
out spam they can write the scripts that

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,470
will send unwanted spam or viruses

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:22,890
through your website they could use your

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:26,660
website to upload unwanted content it

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:29,400
could be in our case it was

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,720
advertisement it could be pornography it

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,070
could be viruses it could be even

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,709
pictures that they don't know where else

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:42,480
to birth right but they will use your

00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:47,010
website as storage basically or data

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:53,130
theft of the most basic kind if someone

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:56,670
sends a comment to your blog their email

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,890
is stored inside your website if you

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,410
have an e-commerce plug-in and someone

00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:03,209
buy something from you their email is

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,430
going to be stored in your website and

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:08,100
not even cryptid in the database

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:12,120
unfortunately but like in the in the

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,550
admin page of WooCommerce or of any

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,699
and content or comment like and you'll

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,999
see the full web the full email so they

00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:23,699
can just basically kind of easily get a

00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:28,079
database of emails to which they can

00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:31,439
send spam afterwards and it's you know

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,949
it's not a very difficult attacked to

00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:38,370
carry on because sadly people use

00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:40,350
unsecure passwords and then you get into

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:45,089
the website you scrape all the emails

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,980
it's really a matter of seconds or they

00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:50,339
could use it to redirect they could

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,259
upload the content they could work as a

00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,300
read director so for example your

00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,689
website your domain still has a good

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,519
reputation for Google their domain

00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:02,459
doesn't have a good reputation so they

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,730
will use your as a proxy to go through

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:09,870
and go to their website and they can

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:15,779
also use this for having a higher place

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:18,629
in the search engine results maybe there

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:24,449
don't have like a malicious intent they

00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:27,300
didn't add any spam or virus but they

00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:30,899
were directing the traffic thus having

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:34,259
more links than climbing the search

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:37,350
results and finally this is something

00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:39,689
that I didn't know existed when I but

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,059
when I started researching for this talk

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:46,589
ransomware do you know what's ransomware

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:50,189
is except for Josh does anyone knows

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:53,220
what ransomware is okay so basically

00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:57,689
it's digital ransom they will get into

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,429
your account you will not be able again

00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,949
to get into your account and they will

00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:04,589
ask for money to release back the

00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:06,569
password and the account to yourself now

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:11,399
this is very popular and also this I

00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:14,699
didn't know on social media about a year

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:17,899
ago there was a massive not massive but

00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:22,470
there was an attack on Italian

00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:24,610
influencers on Instagram about 150 of

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,519
them which had very good account

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,380
with over 50,000 followers they managed

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,230
to get into their account and they sent

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,870
to each one an email that said give us

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,899
four thousand dollars or you don't get

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,640
your Instagram account back now you have

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:41,589
to imagine for example in this case it

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,320
was a lot of ladies that were selling

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:46,240
their arts and crafts and they worked

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,790
hard to get to those fifty thousand

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,800
followers and suddenly you have someone

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,560
that said no give me four thousand

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,040
dollars and luckily in Italy and I guess

00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:00,100
in every country of the word there are

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,110
police sectors that deal with that so

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,820
they were able in about three days to

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,610
solve the situation but this is a thing

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,769
that happens and I didn't know and

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,910
obviously there are effects if your

00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:16,959
website gets hacked reputation did you

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:19,390
ever visited a website that was marked

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:23,920
as hacked or insecured and went back to

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:26,380
it I don't think so because once you say

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,579
oh this website is hacked I don't know

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,339
what's gonna happen to me but I'm not

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:32,079
gonna go there anymore and it doesn't

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,769
matter if the people will clean up this

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,339
website 30 minutes after you visited

00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:40,329
that's it

00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:42,399
their reputation is done their hacked so

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:46,120
you won't visit them again unless you

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,790
really really want to visit them there's

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,339
a tool by one of the Google tools is a

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,050
Google Safe Browsing and they will put a

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:56,709
notification that the website is not

00:16:53,050 --> 00:17:00,250
secure so again people will not visit

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:02,890
that or your website might be blocked by

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,850
your hosting provider by your internet

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:09,309
provider or by the antivirus software

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,040
you have on your computer how many times

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:15,339
did you get the pop-up that said this

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,100
website is not secure and you will not

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:21,480
go there it doesn't matter if they sort

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:26,040
it out and let's not forget about cost

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,040
so when our website was hacked

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,470
none of us had any idea how to remove

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,550
the thing and at the time we were with a

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,510
teeny tiny hosting in Italy that wasn't

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,340
really ready

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:43,210
this kind of things so we had to pay

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,730
someone to clean up our website and the

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:48,790
website was down for well in that

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,430
specific case that website doesn't make

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,800
any revenue so we didn't lose revenue

00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:57,460
but still that website was down for over

00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:00,790
two days and it's not great and we also

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,460
had to pay someone to to take care of it

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:09,160
so it could be also you know there's a

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:11,770
cost for cleaning this up now I think no

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,740
one can guarantee you that your website

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:17,230
will not be attacked ever and that your

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:22,120
website is a hundred percent safe am i

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:25,270
right Josh when I say this okay because

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,490
I know that a lot of companies use you

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,890
know super secure servers and stuff like

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:34,570
that and it's true obviously both

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,970
hosting companies and servers or

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,310
anything will put in place all the

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,900
measures they have to make it secure but

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,660
there is no such thing as a hundred

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,730
percent secure what we can do and it

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,560
starts honestly from your computer right

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:54,700
now we can try to reduce the chances of

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:58,440
being attacked and it starts with the

00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,410
simplest and most overlooked measure

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,620
that you have to secure your website and

00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:08,980
your computer use a secure password

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:15,580
it means use the longer password how

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:17,860
long 25 characters panic no one

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:22,320
remembers 25 characters I hardly

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:25,840
remember my son birthday so this is why

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,720
the internet gave us password managers

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,460
which are fantastic pieces of software

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:37,600
that will allow you to put all your

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:39,910
logins inside an app and you will need

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,110
to remember just one the master password

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,940
to go inside the app itself now beware

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:49,990
make your research before you pick the

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,170
password manager because one very

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:58,670
popular one was

00:19:51,170 --> 00:20:02,770
act now I know that one password has

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:06,320
never been hacked so my personal

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,090
preference is for one password it's

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,990
called one password look it up

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:14,450
it works for Mac phones Android whatever

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,090
and it's not super expensive I think

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,370
it's about fifty dollars a year and it's

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,770
effective they change the UI I don't

00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,950
really like it but I'd like to complain

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,900
with UI changes so maybe it's just me

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,480
don't reuse passwords that's another

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:33,500
thing that we all do because we're lazy

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,900
and we cannot again remember one you

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,110
know too many passwords so we reuse the

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,050
same password why you shouldn't these

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:45,740
bots carry on this automated attacks

00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:48,620
right so they find out they attack

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,710
thousands of services online services at

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,170
the same time so they find out that that

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,540
specific email with that specific

00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:00,350
password they were managed to figure out

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:03,350
for Gmail as soon as they figure out

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,540
that they will check other thousands of

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,760
online services to see if you use the

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,030
same combination of password and email

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,640
for other services so you thought they

00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:16,280
hacked your gmail account while in a

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,680
very short period of time also your

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,910
LinkedIn Facebook Twitter bank account

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,610
national health security or whatever

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,770
it's also hacked the other thing that I

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,510
like about one password and it's one

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:34,190
thing that I'm doing because I realized

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:36,890
that I had 90 over 300 website using the

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:42,680
same password which is not my son

00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:46,400
birthday to my defense so what I'm doing

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:49,100
now I'm going through all these services

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,110
and find new passwords for them instead

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,120
of using always the same one the other

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,050
thing that one password and I imagine

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,390
every password manager does they also

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:01,160
create they can generate long passwords

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,920
for you so you don't have to come up

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:07,370
with 25 characters on your own

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:12,500
you just get the app to do it and you

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:18,440
just copy-paste the other thing that

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:22,460
it's so easy and so overlooked it

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:26,630
keeping its having plugins and themes

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:29,480
form trusted sources now if you just

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,980
started your WordPress website you

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,380
probably don't really know what the

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,390
trusted sources is like you know for us

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,090
that we've been in the business for many

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,400
years you mentioned one plugin I'm like

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:46,160
you're cool you mentioned another one

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,780
I'm like so but this is because we have

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,740
the experience for that if you just

00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:56,090
started my suggestion would be install

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:59,600
things that are inside wordpress.org and

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:03,530
also in that case you're not 100% secure

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:07,400
but let's say it's a bit better than

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:13,640
going to unknown sources so you go to

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:17,840
wordpress.org and you have this plugins

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:21,770
themes or you go inside your WordPress

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,410
websites and you go to plugins add new

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:27,050
and then you will have all the plugins

00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:29,930
that are in the official repo and the

00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:31,000
same goes for themes now look out for

00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:35,390
this kind of things

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,300
when was the plugin last updated so

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,120
WordPress used to be updated about two

00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,280
three times a year then we had a year

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,390
and a half without updates and now we're

00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,270
having updates about it two months I

00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:54,080
would say so check wait was that last

00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,790
updated because now we are at 5.1.1 that

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,030
was released a few weeks ago if that

00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:01,730
plugin that you're using was updated two

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:04,460
years ago I can promise you there's a

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,670
vulnerability somewhere because in the

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,410
meantime we up the PHP version we

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,570
probably change the three version of

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,000
WordPress made three major version of

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:17,120
WordPress and with each of this version

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,750
we usually make also some security

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,650
patches

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,570
so check when it was last updated the

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,040
active installations I would say it's

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:30,650
important but not I wouldn't base the

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,170
whole decision on that because we gotta

00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,720
start from somewhere so good for these

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:40,240
people that have five million in stuffs

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,240
can someone guess which plugin that is

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:54,800
nope nope it's Yoast SEO and I took this

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,380
screenshot this morning so they have

00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,910
five plus million active installation

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,740
because obviously they're they're a big

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,500
player in the industry they've been

00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,630
around for years they're trusted but

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,850
there might be some new plugins that

00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,590
they're also very good as long as you

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,660
see that the developers are involved

00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:14,060
with the development process as long as

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,850
you see that they update it as long as

00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,590
you see that they have the minimum

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,810
requirements and they're involved with

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,880
the community and they reply to support

00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,070
question then even if they have 100

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,290
installs give them a try they just

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,210
started also you also started with one

00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,250
installation right now they have five

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,490
million parts but if you want to be mega

00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:36,290
sure and you don't know still do the

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:40,640
industry so well stick with something

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:44,180
like this it's tested up to 5.1.1 which

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:48,950
is the latest release of WordPress you

00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:51,350
need for 4.9 to work PHP is a bit low

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:54,440
but by the end of the year is going to

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:59,560
be better and it has good ratings it has

00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:03,170
5 stars but with an incredible amount of

00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,960
reviews this I forgot to change the

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:12,640
slide so it's in Italian but it says

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:15,140
that in the last two months they had 580

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,860
questions in the forum and they replied

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:21,350
and close to 535 so they're active right

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,320
so I would say at the beginning stick to

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:28,280
this wordpress.org the things that you

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,200
have in your rep oh the other thing that

00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,430
you have to do is update now when I

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,820
started working with where

00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:36,380
Persis was about 2008 I remember my

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,700
mentor the person that taught me

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,250
everything about WordPress was like

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,840
don't touch an update before three weeks

00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:46,490
I think why oh because there's a number

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,470
of problem and they're gonna release a

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,420
security patch and you're gonna get the

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,260
white screen of death and all this kind

00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:56,390
of stuff this doesn't happen anymore

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:59,660
updates are absolutely safe to do

00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,970
immediately after they're released and

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:07,070
by the way this is what one of the

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:10,690
pillars of hosted of managed hosting is

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:14,570
that the hosting company will do the

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:17,150
update for you basically not immediately

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,870
because obviously millions of customers

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:25,460
but within a reasonable amount of time

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:28,490
I'm saying this especially because last

00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,460
year in December WordPress five point

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,740
all came out I don't know if you were

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:38,480
involved somehow in this thing but it

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:41,540
looked like Armageddon it was like the

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,230
moment they hit the release button

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:48,530
millions of websites are gonna go

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:51,140
belly-up and it's gonna ruin and destroy

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:55,970
everything guess what it didn't happen

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:59,600
and I am very lucky to work for hosts I

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,140
love data I love numbers is like pouring

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,750
for me

00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,810
you go and see how many websites there

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,120
are and how many get updated so the the

00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:10,760
thing is we waited for a few days just

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,000
to be sure and then we started rolling

00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,660
out updates and guess what nothing

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,850
happened

00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:22,280
just super custom-developed website had

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:26,960
some problems that were clearly edge

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:31,130
cases everything else just worked well I

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,170
think especially after WordPress 5.0 we

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:37,490
should really trust the system and get

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:39,260
the updates as soon as they come out but

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:43,230
if you don't have a managed hosting

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:50,370
company and you do manual up

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:52,769
do them just after you do a backup god

00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:55,380
they're so boring I mean no one likes to

00:28:52,769 --> 00:29:00,720
do a backup right so but we not only you

00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:03,120
need to do it make - I know you're

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,360
you're looking like you're in pain

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:11,880
I know IIM pyth eyes I hate doing

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:15,210
backups do backups - two of them one

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,860
with your hosting its problems again if

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,539
you have managed hosting the hosting

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,720
will take care of it but if you still

00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:24,630
don't have managed hosting just activate

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,080
it through the user area and save one

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,820
copy in your computer which means that

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,539
you also have to pick up your computer

00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,279
if you're a Mac user it's pretty

00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,820
straightforward there is this time

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,519
machine

00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:41,880
get yourself an external hard drive they

00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,970
cost basically nothing nowadays and keep

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,779
the backups

00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:51,929
the other thing test the restore because

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:54,690
sometimes you trust the backup you have

00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:57,330
30 days of backup and when it's time to

00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,679
do the restore you don't know where to

00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,539
do where to start

00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,799
it doesn't work the internet goes down I

00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,350
don't know like you know like the

00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:08,309
ceiling Blues Brothers when Carrie

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,659
Fisher arises that all the excuses in

00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,510
the world that's what happens with

00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,840
backups please always make - and make

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,940
sure your you have everything in place

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,519
backup your computer use a safe password

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,649
also for your computer possibly because

00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,080
we're I don't know where the word camp I

00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:27,480
leave my computer everywhere because I

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,760
trust this community no one is ever

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,980
gonna touch my computer no one is gonna

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,049
steal it no one is gonna look at the

00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,450
content but guess what sometimes it

00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:38,820
happens this is there is a saying also

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:42,149
in the security word that say something

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:45,000
like humans are the weakest link because

00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:48,210
you might have put super advanced

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,549
technical stuff in place to secure

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,490
yourself then you go work at Starbucks

00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:55,980
you leave your websites on a table you

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:59,400
go to the bathroom and you don't

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,860
put your computer on sleep and then if

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,799
I'm someone that has malicious intent I

00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:07,830
just go and grab everything I need or

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,840
you put your password again I did it

00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,520
on your piece of paper and then the

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,270
piece of paper falls next to your

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,640
computer guess what you're hacked take

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:20,309
care of all these things and finally

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,679
this is the fifth tip I have for you so

00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:27,240
HTTP doesn't secure your work your

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:31,710
website that's not what HTTPS does HTTPS

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:34,260
secures the communication between your

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,090
website and the rest of the world what

00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,280
does it mean I'm again I'm not going to

00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:41,520
go into technical details but it's a

00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:46,020
protocol that works both ways so I asked

00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:50,429
to see an HTTPS website the website yes

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,840
hello the user the client says hello now

00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:54,679
we know that we have a secure

00:31:51,840 --> 00:32:00,090
communication now it's safe to put data

00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:02,730
don't ever put any any any information

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:06,440
of any kind on a website that doesn't

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:09,960
have that green locket that says secure

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:13,470
now two years ago this was like a fancy

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,559
thing to have today there is no excuse

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:19,980
not to have an SSL certificate on your

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,370
web site one Google will penalize you in

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,320
terms of search results if you have a

00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:29,790
non secure website so if you still use

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:33,299
the HTTP protocol - it's free there's a

00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:35,760
fantastic body called let's encrypt that

00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:38,100
issues free certificates a lot of the

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,850
hosting that are here today support

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,190
let's encrypt is an open-source project

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:47,490
so you don't need to learn how to

00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:49,470
install an SSL certificate which is kind

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,900
of difficult you just need to press a

00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:56,100
button most of the time in your web site

00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,990
in your web hosting user area and the

00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,790
other great thing is that most hosting

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:03,510
Saigon's for sure but I'm sure are there

00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:05,010
hosting now force HTTP to every page on

00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:08,410
the web site because I don't know if you

00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:11,740
try to have HTTPS a few years ago then

00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:14,890
you had four four pages things that

00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:18,370
didn't work but now I assume that in

00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,260
most of the big house managed hosting is

00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:23,020
just the press of a button just to force

00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,730
HTTPS Everywhere around the website so

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,940
honestly there is no excuse the other

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:31,180
thing that we used to say we used to

00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,670
hear is HTTPS will slow down your

00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:38,230
computer that's also not true because

00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:42,580
now today most hosting will have on

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:45,810
their servers HTTP 2 which is the second

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:49,810
version of HTTP which is much faster

00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:51,730
HTTP 3 also is coming so don't be afraid

00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,380
that HTTPS will slow down your computer

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,030
and again it's free will like free

00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,900
things so just get as necessary

00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:01,780
certificates I will end by saying that

00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:05,050
security is a shared responsibility now

00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:07,150
I don't know if some of you already put

00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,919
in place this kind of measures maybe

00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:11,800
some of you never heard of this and my

00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:14,080
you might be a bit overwhelmed oh my god

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,480
now I have to think about 25 characters

00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,720
to secure my website and I need to learn

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,150
what it is SSL certificate no luckily

00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:24,570
you're not alone in all of this there

00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:29,669
are at least three stakeholders in the

00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:32,830
security process us the website owners

00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:35,020
we will do everything in our power not

00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,790
to get hacked and to secure the

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,060
communication with the people that

00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,590
hopefully want to visit our website

00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,169
developers that develop themes and

00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:46,840
plugins pick the right partners because

00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:49,120
if they care about their plugins and

00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,429
themes they will do whatever they can to

00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,310
make them secure for you and obviously

00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:57,640
hosting so hosting is a partner in all

00:34:54,310 --> 00:35:00,490
of this because all the hosting

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,040
companies will take care of security at

00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:06,010
a machine level things that you don't

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,660
like how many of you heard the not Josh

00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:18,310
obviously how many of you heard toward

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:21,250
WAF ok three over I would say 6070

00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:22,270
people I don't know what wef is and you

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,950
don't need an eye

00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:28,780
no living but you don't so these are

00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:31,720
firewall rules that are written at a

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:36,580
server level you need to be a sysadmin

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:38,380
to do that you don't need to be Simon

00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,290
just pick a hosting that will give you

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,000
the security that you need and that's

00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:47,220
pretty much it for me thank you for

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,220
having me great job

00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,970
questions

00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:55,180
got a question back here I'm coming

00:35:51,970 --> 00:36:04,890
right fit for me offer Josh okay I'll

00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:09,220
take it weeks ago months ago our

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:11,950
WordPress meetup we had a speaker from

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,890
wordfence okay and she said something

00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:18,880
that I don't understand or like which

00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:21,910
was that using the subdomain is a

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:26,710
security risk now I like to use a

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:31,660
subdomain for some of my projects what

00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:32,560
was the argument behind it I cannot

00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:42,910
understand it either

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:46,180
lettuce Josh well I mean if you put if

00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,700
you put all the measures that we talked

00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:52,810
about also in place for your subdomain

00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:57,790
so you have a long password to access it

00:36:52,810 --> 00:37:00,910
you have HTTPS you know any of this

00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:03,010
thing a subdomain is the same thing as a

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,670
domain I don't I cannot think of a

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,670
reason why

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:14,859
ah if the sub demic can we get the mic

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,680
to Joshua he's going to explain to us

00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:20,290
why a subdomain might be nothing I can

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,000
think of is if the subdomain where'd you

00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:26,319
get compromised it would have access to

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,859
every site that shares with your primary

00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:32,170
site so any site that was connected in

00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:34,180
the folder structure could potentially

00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:38,170
be impacted by one of those sites

00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:45,369
getting yeah so that's the problem also

00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:47,490
in general with shared hosting if so

00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:50,470
inside the same account there could be

00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:54,069
something compromised and then the same

00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:55,690
other files in the same account could be

00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:58,869
compromised one thing that I will

00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,760
suggest you actually to look out on

00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:02,470
shared hosting is one thing that I never

00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,030
know what it's called but it will come

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:12,119
to me

00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:16,869
chroot No so at least you know that

00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:19,510
there might be some vulnerabilities

00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:21,819
inside your account but if another

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,319
account is compromised it will not

00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:25,089
compromise your account which is

00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:27,310
something that was happening back in the

00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:29,560
days back in the days when you had like

00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:31,510
a hundred it doesn't matter how many

00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,670
accounts you had on a server - or a

00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:39,640
twenty five thousand if there was not

00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:41,530
this protected scope no but it has

00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,280
something with root I'll look it up and

00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:49,060
and see CH root so it's called chroot

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,369
and this will prevent different accounts

00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:56,530
on the same machine to compromised each

00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:59,770
other to look out for that this is a

00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,300
quick question in shared hosting a lot

00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,180
of times you have an opportunity by a

00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,520
dedicated IP getting a dedicate and it's

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,560
just a small amount of add-on yeah it's

00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,420
a dedicated IP do anything to help with

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,069
accurate e it off in dedicated IP has

00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,400
nothing to do with security

00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:17,530
dedicated IP is just so you have your IP

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,190
and it's dedicated so if you access the

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:24,109
say

00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:25,789
services or websites or you are in there

00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:27,829
there is a number of reasons why I

00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:31,219
dedicated IP could be a good idea but

00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:32,749
security is not one of them no no all

00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:35,079
right a big round of applause thank you

00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:35,079
