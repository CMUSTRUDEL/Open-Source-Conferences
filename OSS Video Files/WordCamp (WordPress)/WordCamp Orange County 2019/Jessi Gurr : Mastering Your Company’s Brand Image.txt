thank you can everyone hear me okay all

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,260
right so you may have heard some of

00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,910
these statistics but 50% 50% of

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,410
businesses fail within their first year

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,530
80% of businesses don't make it to the

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,830
five year mark

00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,450
96% of businesses while their

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,329
dissolution papers before they hit their

00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,980
10th anniversary 96 percent of

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,089
businesses go out of business before

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,589
they are 10 years old why is this it's

00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:42,510
not because people don't know how to run

00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:44,489
a business it's not because people can't

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,079
find good employees it's not because

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,570
they don't produce quality products or

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,940
provide quality services it's because

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,760
business owners are spending so much of

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,429
their time and so much of their money

00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,109
focusing on selling their products

00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:02,039
they're focusing on building their

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,409
business they're not spending enough of

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,810
their time or enough of their energy on

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,399
building a brand a business brand is

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,219
what takes a business past its tenth

00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:16,710
year of business having a solid brand it

00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:23,460
was what allows that business to go from

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,420
year five into year six and on I have

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,960
been working on building a business

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,130
since 2005 in the past six or seven

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,680
years I have been really solidly

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,619
focusing on not just building a business

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,329
but building a brand so I've become

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,920
pretty passionate about this subject and

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,530
that's why I'm here today talking about

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,600
building a brand specifically mastering

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,030
your brand image so that you can keep

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,000
your business in business past the

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,320
five-year mark past the 10-year mark

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,210
past the time when your products have

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,310
completely morphed into something

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,740
different so what is a brand

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,320
a lot of business owners think they

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,520
spend pretty good at a pretty good

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,950
amount of money pretty good amount of

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,749
time investing in the things that help

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,189
them market their business there are

00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:07,619
they're hiring graphic designers they're

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,590
hiring photographers they're creating

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,760
things that they think is a brand we're

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,519
gonna talk about some of the things that

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,860
a brand is not so we can kind of go into

00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,300
what a brand actually is and first and

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,870
foremost your brand is not

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,720
your logo your brand is not your

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,820
business name you can spend thousands of

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,440
dollars developing a great logo all of

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,710
the sponsors here today have fantastic

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,510
logos but if I show you this logo for

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,460
some random airline company it doesn't

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,660
matter how great their logo is it

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,190
doesn't matter that they spent eight

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,170
thousand dollars for a graphic designer

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,790
to make that logo it doesn't even matter

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,970
that they came up with a business name

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:50,130
that is truly indicative of what they do

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,740
because as soon as you walk away you're

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,690
not gonna remember this logo you're not

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,760
gonna remember this company you need

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,770
something more you need something to

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,960
remember them by so that when you see

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,210
their logo again something sparks in

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,010
your head oh that's right that's that

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,480
company but what is it it's not your

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,250
color scheme it's not your website

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,110
design again something that a lot of

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,360
business owners dump a lot of time a lot

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,980
of money into they get graphic designers

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,630
they get whole web design teams they

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,650
spend five thousand ten thousand

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:26,990
hundreds of thousands of dollars on

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:30,450
building an online presence or a logo

00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:33,420
McDonald's great example we all know the

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,459
McDonald's brand they've got a pretty

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,170
solid color scheme they probably spent

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,020
tens maybe hundreds of thousands of

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,060
dollars on a great website but

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,860
McDonald's website and their colors it

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,550
isn't all that different from the Five

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,730
Guys Burgers colors and website which

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:54,209
really isn't all that different from two

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,590
dry products and isn't really all that

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,700
different from Burger King so clearly

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,510
these are not the same companies

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:06,300
marketing to the same groups of people

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:09,050
your website your colors your logo these

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,820
aren't the things that make your brand

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,990
and also your brand is not the awesome

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,600
products and services that you provide

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,609
of course of course as a business owner

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,989
you need to be developing top-notch

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,390
products you need to be providing

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,860
awesome service to your customers but

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,510
your products aren't what is going to

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,580
keep you in business how many of you

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,550
have been in the WordPress industry for

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,110
more than five years how many of you are

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,990
doing exactly what you were doing five

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,389
years ago

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,090
one first one person alright so another

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,789
great example of this 15 years ago I

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,490
wanted to get a watch I'd walk up to the

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:46,470
jewelry sand in my little department

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,970
store and I'd I pick out a watch thirty

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,759
years ago it was a swatch those were

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,860
pretty cool but today if I want to know

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,419
what time it is if I don't rely on my

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,610
phone I'm not gonna go buy that watch

00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,080
I'm gonna get this cool thing that

00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,789
tracks my heartbeat it tells me how many

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,889
hours I sleep every night it tells me

00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:04,080
how much REM sleep I get it even tells

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:08,280
me how many laps I swam at the pool oh

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,750
yeah and it tells time it's 3:45 but

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,259
what's this thing gonna be like in five

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,110
years

00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,270
am I gonna buy another Fitbit or am I

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,610
gonna get a chip put it in my hand it

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,699
tells me the time sends me my text

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,530
messages lets me scan in the check out

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,349
from the grocery lane that's gonna be

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,419
like clearly your brand cannot be the

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,440
product that you sell because in five

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,050
years the products that you're selling

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:36,599
is not going to be the same product that

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:38,669
it was today so what is a brand it's not

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:41,550
your logo it's not your colors it's not

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:46,349
your website it's not even the products

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,759
that you're selling so we're gonna start

00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:50,550
with a couple of examples of pretty

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,460
well-known brands most of us recommend

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,300
recognize Walmart anyone what does what

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,539
do you think of when you think of

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,550
Walmart's cheap cheap crowds low prices

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,759
what else

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:11,279
convenient what else great inventory

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,840
inventory yes checkout yes the people in

00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,069
the checkout staff I asked my

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,870
six-year-old this question and he said

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:19,050
every Walmart is exactly the same and

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,490
they have blue carts Walmart you guys

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,800
made almost all of these low prices

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,300
convenient they've got a certain type of

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,340
customer they have employee

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,440
relationships you know you think a

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,810
little bit about how Walmart treats

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,979
their employees you know the convenience

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,469
they're gonna have the exact same thing

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,180
at every store that you go into and they

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,370
have a certain customer experience you

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:43,529
feel a certain way when you think about

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,740
shopping at Walmart Apple how many of

00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,420
your own Apple product

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,960
how many of you own more than one Apple

00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,420
product

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:55,550
did anyone put their hand down why do

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:57,830
people buy Apple they don't buy why they

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,500
don't think don't buy Apple phones

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,110
because they are technically better than

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,880
their Samsung counterparts they don't

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,070
buy Apple products because they make the

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,360
best software most of the people in this

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,460
room that have an Apple computer are

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,600
probably running Microsoft Word why

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:18,010
didn't you just buy a Microsoft computer

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:21,200
you don't buy Apple products because

00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,370
there's so much better you certainly

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,360
don't buy them because they're cheaper

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,970
than their counterparts how you buy

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,260
Apple and you continue to buy Apple

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:35,120
because you love the brand Apple has

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,770
done something to give you an emotional

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,960
connection to your brand there's a

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,970
reason that you bought your iPhone for

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,350
five times more than the Samsung that

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,270
was sitting next to it and there's a

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,340
reason that when the next iPhone model

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,690
comes out even though you've just spent

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,040
a thousand dollars on the last one

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:53,960
you're gonna be the first person in line

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:57,110
to buy the new model quite a few years

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,330
ago back in the 1990's Apple was going

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,340
through a pretty tough time they had a

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,960
downturn in sales they weren't selling

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,510
as many products the computing age was

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,070
changing and they looked as though they

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,520
were in danger of going out of business

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,690
and right around this time is when they

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,490
really took a shift in their marketing

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,200
and Apple started focusing not on

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,140
selling their computers but on selling

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,780
their brand they developed a unique

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,760
brand that people could relate to they

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,620
came up with a corporate culture they

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,390
made it their vision and they made it

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,790
known that they were going to empower

00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,820
people through technology they put Apple

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:35,000
computers in all of the schools they

00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:38,180
created a unique and consistent visual

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,090
image along with a unique and consistent

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,310
vocabulary if you open up a new MacBook

00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,530
and you start the installation process

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,900
you get the hello screen right you open

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,970
up your iPhone same thing iPad same

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,280
thing you open up the box what do you

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,900
get a little black booklet with the

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,240
Apple logo on it and the first word you

00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,560
see hello super consistent

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,020
Apple has established trust with their

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:09,100
customers and for this reason they have

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:11,300
gained customers for life Marc globe

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,880
marketer and author of emotional

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,150
branding wrote an article talking about

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,740
the 1998 collapse of Apple and how they

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,930
were able to rebound and he said without

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,060
the brand Apple would be completely dead

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,850
the brand is what they have that's all

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,040
they have it's the power of their brand

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,680
that keeps them a lot alive it has

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:36,320
absolutely nothing to do with the

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:39,200
products so to summarize all of that

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,550
your brand is exactly how other people

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,230
feel about your business your brand is

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,290
what makes people want to buy from you

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,150
your brand is what makes people keeping

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:54,350
coming back to purchase from you again

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:56,180
and again your brand is why you have

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,020
customers before you release your next

00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:03,560
product so take a second to look at all

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,530
of these different logos most most

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,210
companies that are well-known will evoke

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,320
certain emotions inside of you how do

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,640
you feel when you think about Walmart

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,800
how do you feel when you think about

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,530
Target how do you feel when you think

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,020

half of your day on how do you feel

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:28,460
about uber and lyft looking at these

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,440
logos is not just pretty pictures on a

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,000
screen there's an emotional connection

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,380
that you have behind all of these

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,450
because of the experiences that you've

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:41,090
had which each with each and every one

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:42,830
of these companies your brain is the

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,890
emotional connection that people have to

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,840
your business it is how people feel

00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,720
about your business but most importantly

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,810
your brand is how people talk about your

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,820
business if people feel warm and fuzzy

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,190
about your business if they have a great

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,290
sense of who you are as a company

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,460
your other customers

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,840
likewise if people get a bad experience

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,520
about your brand if people don't

00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,070
understand what

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,730
Brande is if they don't if they get

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:19,810
confused by your brand messaging they're

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:22,230
gonna talk badly about your brand which

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:29,550
begs the question

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:29,550
that's your is your brand spark joy a

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,030

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,560
excited and super happy to share their

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,900
experience working with your brand with

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,130
their friends and family if they don't

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,360
have a good experience or if they don't

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,500
have an experience at all because you

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,030

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,430
so inevitably the bad news here if your

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,260
brand is how other people feel about

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,540
your business and the emotional

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,540
connection that other people have your

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:06,310
customers are really the ones who

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:09,700
determine your brand so what are we

perceive your business and this is what

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,290

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,510
emails videos you've got meetings in

are six different areas that you need to

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,670
have extreme consistency in so that your

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,820

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,080
your brand is so that they know what

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,370
they should feel about their brand and

00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,640
how they should talk to other people

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,190
about your brand as Steve Jobs said he

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,780
knew a little bit about marketing

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:36,940
marketing is about values so the first

00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,580
thing the first step in mastering your

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,430
brand image is going to be to determine

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,530
what your brand values are this exercise

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,750
right here this is a three hour exercise

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,340
that is going to be more valuable than a

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,070
ten thousand dollar website this

00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,230
exercise for three four hours of

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,920
brainstorming is going to bring more to

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,800
your business than the best design logo

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,360

customers will care about create values

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,550
that you will care them up care about if

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,620
you have a team get them involved with

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,960
this process a few years ago my team and

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,470
I sat down and we had a list of a

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,840
hundred different values personal values

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,190
corporate values and everybody sat down

00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,440
and highlighted the values that rang

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,720
true to them and we talked about it for

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,570
an hour why why is customer service

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,730
important to you why is being responsive

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,520
important to you why is having fun

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,620
important to you why is community

why is family why are all of these

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,750
things important to you and we came up

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,510
with a clear set of brand values for our

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,040
business and it's changed they modify

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,300
over time our customers change a little

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,850
bit the products and services we're

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,680
selling change but every time we have a

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,200
full team meeting on the first page of

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,680
the agenda I make sure that I list our

00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,000
brand values what do we care about what

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,870

really really sticky situations eight

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,660
ten years ago Taco Bell got slapped with

00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,940
a big class-action lawsuit for selling

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:22,030
fake meat meat that's not meat anyone

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:23,260

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,510
could have been I mean this could have

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,980
been doom for Taco Bell they had

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,720
thousands of people this was all over

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,420
the newspapers all over television all

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,080
over social media holy cow Taco Bell is

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:38,290
not selling real meat so what do they do

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,450
they lean on their brand values yo

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:44,460
quiero Taco Bell Taco Bell has some

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:48,010
brand values including humor and honesty

00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,890
so they publish full-page advertisements

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,540
saying thanks for suing us

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,990
tongue-in-cheek let's be super honest

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,140
here

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,910
yeah the beef we buy is 100% beef but

00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,020
now that taco filling 800 percent beef

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:06,310
you know why because plain ground beef

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,870
is boring so here's our recipe here are

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,480
the other ingredients we put into there

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:14,050
because our honesty let's tell you all

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,940
about the reason that we add these

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,090
things and then they went even a step

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:23,380
further they release a series of cartoon

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:25,630
commercials with mr. bland and his llama

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,480
trying to spread blandness all over the

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,800
universe people are eating bland food

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,840
for lunch and this super delicious

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,010
ingredient forum talked about steps in

00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,900
and they put all their secret

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,570
ingredients in and they just change up

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:43,270
the recipe a little bit because because

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:46,300
plain hamburger is just boring their

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,520

interest way more advertising than the

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,450
class-action lawsuit their brain

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,880
recovered from this they could have been

00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,680
in a seriously sticky place last night

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,900
we walked by a Taco Bell Cantina in

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,350
Newport Beach their brain is only

competition what are you doing that's

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,870
different this is another great exercise

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,640
this might take you a little bit longer

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,410
you may have to do some significant

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,940
market research another thing to bring

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,750
your team in on if you work with

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,270
contractors

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,010
if you hire out photographers make sure

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,660
they know

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,400
your unique selling proposition as well

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,780
and make it the lifeblood of your

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,220
business we incorporate our USP we're

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,620
website developers who answer the phone

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,970
we incorporate that into everyday talk

00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:04,590
in our office and we put a little humor

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:08,520
twist on it but when you bring your USP

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,440
what makes you different into your

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,169
business and make that the focal point

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,210
of what you're doing put it on the

00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:17,250
homepage of your website have it as a

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,570
headline on the about Us page your

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,890
customers are going to start to see that

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,330
they're gonna start to remember that and

00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,400
that's what's going to make them

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,320
different every time I go to a marketing

00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,760
meeting or a networking meeting and I

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,110
stand up and I gave my 60-second

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,150
commercial in front of 30 people and I

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,799
have 60 seconds to talk the first thing

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,480
I say is our unique selling proposition

00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,640
the last thing I say is our unique

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,690
selling proposition and that is the only

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,870
thing that people leave the room

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,000
remembering don't care about all the

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:47,880
services that I want to sell them what

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
they care is why we're different if you

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,440
have a team absolutely bring them in on

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,130
your brand values for you bring them in

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,630
on your USP but give them a purpose give

00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,970
your team members of why why are they

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,460
coming to work every day why do they

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,040
want to help your customers why do they

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,770
want to help your company LinkedIn and

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,799
imperative released a study in 2016

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,940
surveyed a whole lot of people most

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:18,179
adults spend most of their waking time

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,850
at work yet only 30% of the people based

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:24,210
survey were satisfied with their jobs

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,500
and the reason for that was because they

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,270
didn't know why they were going to work

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,750
they're going to work to collect a

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:34,830
paycheck they didn't have a goal the

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:36,299
company didn't have values 58% and this

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,320
is part of the survey I'll go back if

00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:40,140
you want to take a picture of this slide

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:45,360
I would recommend this is great that's a

00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:47,250
short link directly to a PDF full full

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,299
results of the survey there's a lot of

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,980
interesting information and they're

00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:53,460
great for there's a sauna straight

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,610
through I'll go back out of there for a

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,610
sec

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,160
but they found by and large that

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,100
companies who paid attention to their

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,760
values and companies who involve their

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,080
employees in their values and in their

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,840
goals and they make goals they gave

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,200
employees a reason and a purpose to come

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,600
to work every day 58% of companies with

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,690
clearly defined visions goals purposes

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:25,170
saw a 10 percent more than 10% increase

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,790
in growth while 42% who did nothing did

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,170
not give their employees a goal did not

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:32,100
give them a reason actually saw a

00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:34,620
decline in their business giving

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,960
employees a purpose a goal a vision a

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,100
reason it's not just gonna make them

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,620
want to come to work every day it's

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,930
gonna make them form stronger bonds with

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,850
their other co-workers they're all going

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,840
to get behind your company's vision it's

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,610
going to lead to a more productive

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,530
workplace it's going to lead to longer

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,780
employee retention and it's going to

00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:57,990
lead to a much better product at the end

00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:59,790
of the day a quote out of the this is in

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,680
the intro to the study that LinkedIn did

00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,900
imagine what would happen if every

00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,160
person in your company was connected to

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,180
a purpose to a job that mattered to them

00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,980
imagine how much more productive they

00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,530
would be think of what we could

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,350
collectively accomplish you have the

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,810
power to make work more meaningful you

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:23,640
can create engagement by inspiration by

00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:25,590
connecting purpose to your work so the

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,630
first three parts of building your brand

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,820
is really about the emotional connection

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,370
what can you do to emotionally connect

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,960
your customers to your business values

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,550
to your business vision how can you

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,130
bring your employees in to get on board

00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:41,730
with your values with your vision next

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,200
it boils down to what business owners

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,070
are dumping a lot of their money into

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,670
which is the actual design the logos the

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:54,360
visual aspects content keeping your

00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,530
content consistent is a huge way to make

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,600
sure that people don't get confused

00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,940
about what your brand message is how do

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,620
you do this the easiest way to create

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,190
consistent content is to pull your

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,140
values your goals your vision into every

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,060
piece of content that you write if you

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,830
think hey let's write this next

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,020
paragraph with our primary vision in

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,270
mind you're probably going to create a

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,340
consistent message throughout every

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:21,930
platform that you advertise on if you

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,880
have a website with content written in

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,040
one tone of voice make sure that your

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,410
social media matches the style that

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:34,980
you're using on your website make sure

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:36,450
that your brochures match thing you can

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,520
do is create a voice guide for your

00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,570
brand talk about the person you want to

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:46,980
talk in first person like a person third

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:50,040
person along with keeping your content

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,270
consistent your colors icons pictures I

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,950
showed this slide to my six-year-old and

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,090
you bust out laughing and I'm like why

00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,930
do you think this is so funny and he

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,520
said well you're giving the talk on

00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:00,450
penguins why'd you put a giraffe in

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:03,360
there stop doing this with your business

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,280
people do this all the time how many

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,020
times have you gotten a business card

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,940
from someone with super swirly fancy

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,140
gold embossed ink and you go to their

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,020
website and it's using a different color

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,610
and different font how many times have

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,620
you had a takeout menu from a Chinese

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,380
restaurant you don't know if that's the

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,710
right takeout menu because the sign

00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,080
that's hanging above their establishment

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,430
is different color or because it's

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,640
exactly the same takeout menu is the

00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:31,590
Chinese shop down the road yeah stop

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,900
doing this make sure that all of your

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,000
colors are consistent across all of your

00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,340
branding if you have read business card

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,870
have a read website have read flyers

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:44,940
if you use open sans fonts on your

00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,590
website use it on your letterhead put it

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,340
on your business card it's not that

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:52,320
difficult to do you can create a brand

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,510
guide and the next slide on here I have

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,140
a link to a template that you can use to

00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,460
create your own brand guide but some

00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,010
things that you want to include in this

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,860
are gonna be information about your

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,150
photographer who's running content for

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,590
you who are your graphic designers it's

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,850
a really great idea for all of the

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,220
people who are playing a part in

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,900
designing for your brand or writing for

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,740
your brand can connect with each other

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:19,970
or have or have resources to be able to

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,970
so here's an example brain style

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,720
something I definitely recommend every

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:29,300
business take the time to do so we're

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,740
gonna include in this your logo you're

gonna have the colors that you're using

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,080
make sure you have them in all different

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,450
forms that your print that your

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,450
embroidery that your website graphic

have 15 different phone numbers that

00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,270
route to different places let's simplify

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:56,600
that let's have one phone number do you

00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,770
have a peel box and a street address why

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,100
are we confusing our customers here

00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:03,110
let's pick one do you have an email

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:08,000
domain what's going on here let's create

example of content that you would use on

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,260
your website maybe pull out the first

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,610
paragraph on your homepage so anyone

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,790
who's working with your business knows

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,840

00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:02,740
yourself has a clear vision and it was

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,810
exactly how they need to move forward

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,850
finally and this is the most important

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,880
one we've got our values we've got our

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:13,040
USP we've got a purpose we've got colors

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,170
we've got a logo make sure you're

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,360
representing your brand everywhere you

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,430
go in person you're attending meetings

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,280
with your customers you're taking sales

00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,990
calls you're answering the phone you're

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,150
going to networking events maybe you're

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,350
here at a conference today as part of

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,630
your company

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,270
maybe you donate maybe you run

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,540
philanthropic events maybe you

00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:37,330
host fundraisers for local charities

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,240
maybe your team just goes on a bunch of

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:42,160
social outings fall back on your brand

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:48,850
image refer to your brand guide before

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:52,210
you go out so if you're maybe running a

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:55,030
business with black and red colors you

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,860
use an animal as one of your low as your

00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,390
logo elements you'd like to speak at

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,660
conferences and so you put slide decks

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:05,440
together right it might be a good idea

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:07,420
when you attended conferences that your

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,070
slide decks matched your branding maybe

00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,680
a little bit if you have a professional

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,670
headshot on your website it might be a

00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,980
good idea that that professional

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,360
websites not six years old so that when

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,820
people see you they can recognize who

00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,750
you are you might even consider dressing

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,750
in a similar fashion

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:31,230
I don't know make it super easy don't

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,090
confuse your customers if I was standing

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,920
up here in a full-length dress

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,010
he helped me like who is that person

00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,310
standing at the front of the room be

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:44,600
consistent be consistent in all of your

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:46,710
marketing have consistent brand values

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,620
talk about them with your employees

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:53,220
share them with your team create a

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,290
unique selling proposition people don't

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,220
fall in love or people don't buy from

00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,230
Apple people don't buy from Microsoft

00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,730
because of the product that they sell

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:10,100
they buy because they love the brand

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,100
it's a summary my slides are up online

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,300
feel free to download them or tweet me

00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:38,490
and I think we have time for some

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:39,960
questions any questions yes it can be

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,740
the question is is the tagline the same

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,370
as your USP

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,810
it can be in our case our USP is we're

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,310
web developers who answer the phone and

00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:50,100
so we do pretty much use that as our

00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,600
tagline but a lot of businesses will

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,720
have a unique selling proposition that

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,040
is not exactly the same as their tagline

00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:10,470
tagline should be super memorable should

00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:12,060
be short yes I'll repeat a question

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,970
about do we do personality assessments

00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,440
for our teams we do actually we have

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,960
every team member take the strengths

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,610
finder assessment usually right after

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,810
they start oftentimes prior to starting

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,950
depending on their role in the company

00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,300
we just went through a really big

00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,180
team-building session where we did

00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:29,220
myers-briggs personality typing and we

00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,810
spent a full day talking about our

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,570
personality types and just really

00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,780
breaking it down personality typing

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,300
definitely a

00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,700
rate a great way to get insight about

00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,080
the strengths that your individual team

00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:51,100
members have lean on those absolutely

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:58,360
yeah questions five minutes we got five

00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:00,090
more minutes yeah the question is does

00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,880
your event brand evolve over time

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:07,180
absolutely yes absolutely um especially

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:11,530
in this industry things are changing for

00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:14,140
us for us specifically you know we have

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,880
we have grown and gone from you know

00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,260
just a one-person team to a two-person

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,940
team to a four-person team to a

00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,160
nine-person team and so the type of

00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,260
customer that we work with has changed

00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,000
as our business has changed the type of

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,290
products that we enjoy projects that we

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,710
enjoy working on have changed

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:32,710
so yeah the brand can change like I said

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:34,570
earlier you know it's really great to

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,220
maintain consistency for as long as you

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,130
can there have been companies that have

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,920
gone through complete rebranding with

00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:45,460
success I would say the core elements

00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,900
behind your brand your values your USP

00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,880
to some extent although that can change

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,250
butBut your values should remain

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,110
consistent and if you are going to make

00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:56,260
a change you know change in a way that

00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,940
makes sense to your customers and don't

00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,610
confuse your customers make sure they

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,210
know why you're changing be super open

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,210
about the change

00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,140
yeah so the question was you know for

00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,880
bigger companies you obviously need to

00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,289
have kind of a corporate brand but a lot

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,640
of freelancers they've got themselves as

00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,350
their personal brand and then they have

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,059
their company that they're running a

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,590
freelancer under should you distinguish

00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,630
those and I think the answer is really

00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,539
it depends are people buying from you

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,970
because they know you and they like you

00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:48,549
can you use your strengths your values

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:51,990
your mission to further build out your

00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:54,730
brand I think that any business owner

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,110
that starts a business with brand values

00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,059
that are completely opposite from their

00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,799
personal values is just setting

00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:01,860
themselves up to fail so in some

00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:04,299
respects even large corporations the

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,399
very heart of it there has to be someone

00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:08,559
who is connecting emotionally the owner

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,370
of the business to those values that's

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,370
what makes them work

00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:27,940
any other questions huh all right thank

00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,940
you everyone

00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,080
