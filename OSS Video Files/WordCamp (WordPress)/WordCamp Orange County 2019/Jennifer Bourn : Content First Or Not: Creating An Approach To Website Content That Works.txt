good afternoon so today we are talking

00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,550
about content first the approach things

00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:18,230
that are wrong with that I think and

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,170
things that are right with that but

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,820
first I have a question for you how many

00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,720
people play the game of telephone when

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,570
you were a kid you'd all line up in the

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,490
line right and one person would say

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,410
something in the first person's ear and

00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,600
then get repeated all the way down the

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,449
line and by the time you got to the last

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,969
person and they set it out loud the

00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:44,480
message the first person had had

00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:46,550
completely changed or been misunderstood

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,769
along the way by the time it was

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,949
regurgitated and repeated over and over

00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:53,600
down the line the last person didn't

00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:58,100
have the same message but yet they were

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,649
trying to say the same thing right never

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,479
or hardly when you ever played the game

00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:04,610
of telephone did it ever come out where

00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,370
the the person at the end had the same

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,170
intent and meaning as the first person

00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,290
that started which was kind of why the

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,870
game was fun but this can be really

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,210
problematic when you experience the same

00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:23,810
thing when you're talking about business

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:27,290
concepts so the idea of working content

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,220
first in a website design project in any

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:34,250
kind of design project ah is similar

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,560
kind of what happened to that message is

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,250
similar to what happens in a game of

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,060
telephone right very rarely have I seen

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:46,790
people communicate the truth of what the

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,910
idea of content first what the intention

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:53,750
of the content first approach actually

00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:57,860
meant so the original intention if you

00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:01,100
look back it was like 2008 ish when the

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,920
first few people leaders in the design

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,940
industry people who were blogging before

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,250
blogging was a huge thing posted some

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:16,030
blog posts they shared some articles

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:18,090
about using a content first approach and

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,150
then what happened

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,390
was all the sheep in the design industry

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,340
said yes that's so right and they all

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,790
started regurgitating that same message

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,730
and we've seen it in blog posts and on

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,270
social media and at events we see all of

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,580
these people talking about content first

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,959
but the problem is most of those people

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,770
didn't actually read the original

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:47,310
articles they saw the tweet or they

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:52,290
heard the idea content first and over

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,060
time what that intent was had eroded and

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,250
now we have lots of people who

00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,690
completely misunderstand what that means

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,720
and it's causing problems right the idea

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,760
of working content first has all of a

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,300
sudden become an avenue for other people

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,010
to tell you that you're doing it wrong

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,060
and I think that that's crap right

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,610
that's not okay

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,130
I have had people tell me and I've been

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,930
doing client work for 20 years I've had

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,650
people tell me as recently as last week

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,269
you're doing it wrong I kind of think

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,329
there were loads of testimonials and

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,519
happy clients I have say otherwise but

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,700
people still want to say you're doing it

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,170
wrong and part of the reason why I

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,570
wanted to submit this talk and talk

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,920
about this today is because I'm tired of

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,570
people telling other people that they're

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,239
doing it wrong because they're not doing

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,590
it their way and I'm tired of people

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,630
telling you that you're doing it wrong

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,690
because of something they misunderstood

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,660
in the first place so we're talking

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,910
about content first but first we have to

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,820
address the giant misunderstanding here

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,070
in that most people read content first

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,630
and thought that meant I'm not going to

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:05,480
start design until the content is done

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:09,299
content first doesn't mean content done

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,299
first right that's not that was never

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,540
the intention of what using a content

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,750
first approach meant now I read these

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,310
things online I read all the stuff I

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,350
went to the conference's I listened to

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,780
the people talk about how you should do

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,840
content first and how they said that

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,940
meant you should have the content done

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,409
first and occasionally I run into

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,970
designers and I run into people that

00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:33,440
they like

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,110
I didn't even start the website until I

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,030
get final content from the client I was

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,130
like I'll give it a try I'm willing to

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,710
try anything right maybe there's not a

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,300
great and I gave it a try and I thought

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,130
I'll try it on like three client

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,050
projects and we'll see how it goes

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,330
they are the worst three projects I've

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,670
ever done in my entire career

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:56,390
they were the crappiest the clients had

00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:00,260
the worst experience and I lost my butt

00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:03,380
and here is the problem right when I

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,110
made clients get their content done

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,370
first like I'm not even to start working

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,250
with you unless you have your content

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,250
done the clients are like what do you

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,980
want me to do poop it out like I'm not a

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,810
copywriter I don't know what I'm doing

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,610
I've never done this before I don't

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,110
build websites for a living I don't know

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,850
what to put on my about page I don't

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,920
know what to put on my homepage I don't

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,750
know what pages I even need you're

00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,540
telling me that I need to have it done

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,940
first so what happens they procrastinate

00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,920
and they procrastinate and they

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,170
procrastinate and all of a sudden you

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,970
took the deposit for a project and four

00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,290
months have gone by five months have

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,760
gone by and you still haven't even

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,320
started because they haven't finished

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,360
their content and it's because they

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,060
don't know what to say there you're

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,910
having to make it up case scenario one

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,010
the other issue I ran into get your

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,440
content done first then I'll talk to you

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,320
client puts tons of effort into getting

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,960
their content done they give it to me

00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,450
and I'm like based on the goals we just

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,580
talked about this and go work right

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,070
based on the goals you're telling me you

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,110
want to achieve with your site based on

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,620
the priorities of actions the things you

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,870
want people to do on your site if we use

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,270
this content you're not going to achieve

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,250
your goals and I have to go back and say

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,220
well I'm glad you did all that work but

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,590
I actually need this instead or I

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,060
actually need you to do more work I need

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,300
you to write something different or we

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,730
have to change this and the client would

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,080
get so mad why didn't you tell me this

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:40,370
up front right so I gave it a fair shot

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,310
the idea of content done and because it

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,020
was such a massive failure for me and my

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,620
clients were so unhappy and one we

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,770
actually part

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,660
I never even actually built the site I

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,180
went back and started looking at where

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,400
the idea of getting content done first

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,370
actually came from and how on earth

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,650
people can do this successfully right so

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,150
I started looking at it and again I told

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,979
you I've been chained for this approach

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,600
every time I talk about the fact that I

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,930
don't get content from clients first

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:14,300
they're like you're doing it wrong

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:16,430
Twitter last week totally happened today

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,380
we're dispelling those myths we're

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,350
squashing all of those misunderstandings

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,729
were setting things straight right we're

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,180
talking about what the original

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,949
intention was what content first

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,650
actually means and how it applies to

00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,500
your projects and how it applies to web

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:37,220
design and client work and providing

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,190
extraordinary client experiences so

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:45,979
content first does not mean content done

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:47,840
first most of the time I also refer and

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:51,020
believer there's no one way as the right

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,400
way so there's no general approach that

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,289
says this is the only way that's ever

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,599
going to work but for the sake of today

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,910
I'm saying content first doesn't mean

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,630
content done first and it wasn't the

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,160
original intention so there's a quote if

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,930
you look there's a smashing magazine

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,060
article from several years ago and

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,660
there's a quote from a guy named mark

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,370
Bolton

00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,110
he says content first is not about

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,610
writing final content before doing

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,139
anything it's about knowing the

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,639
structure of the content you're

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:22,010
designing for you can create good

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,760
experiences without knowing the content

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:28,699
but what you can't do is you can't

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:33,469
create good experiences without knowing

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:37,130
the content structure so content first

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:40,580
means the strategy and the structure

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,760
comes first because to create good

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,709
content you have to have context for

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,029
that content you have to know what

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:51,740
you're creating it for so there's a

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,500
quote that goes out all the time design

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,280
in the absence of content is not design

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,400
it's decoration right people say this

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,750
when they're appreciating the

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,370
ten first right if you don't have

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,210
content first you're not doing web

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,830
design you're just decorating things I

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,870
want to change that my preference would

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:13,800
be designed in the absence of content

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,960
strategy is not design it's decoration

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,170
right when you're when you're designing

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,350
something with no clear strategy then

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:25,370
you're just designing it to look pretty

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:29,010
content strategy and a clear structure

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,740
of how the content is going to flow on

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,410
what's gonna be on each page of what the

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,740
different content types are right that

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:43,760
provides the critical context needed to

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:47,790
both content and design so excuse me a

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:53,850
Content first approach isn't design with

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:55,590
content it's design based on content so

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,860
it's how you can get started with the

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:01,020
design of a citing final content because

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,820
you've mapped out the strategy you

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,340
understand the structure of what you

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,070
need you know what you're designing for

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,840
you might have an idea of headlines and

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,960
certain things like that you're

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,260
designing based on what has been

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,460
outlined and done so I design sites

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,410
without completed content all the time

00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:27,090
but I don't design sites without a

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:29,820
content strategy in place right you have

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,040
to understand what you're designing for

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,380
it's why we talk with clients at the

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,730
beginning of projects about what goal do

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,560
you have for this site right what's the

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,930
purpose of us doing this project what

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,310
results do you want to see and then what

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,410
do you want people to do when they get

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,330
to that site right if they come to your

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,120
site and they only do one thing what is

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,190
it that you want them to do if they love

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,650
you and they stay longer and they do two

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,230
things what's the second thing you want

00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,000
them to do before they leave if they

00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,410
absolutely fall in love with your brand

00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and they stay longer what's the third

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,800
thing

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,800
right and then the question from there

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,540
goes based on each page that they're on

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,230
how do we get someone to take that first

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,150
action from this page in the next page

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,760
how do we get someone to move from here

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,130
to

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,960
take that action from this page when you

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,970
understand those things and you have

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,450
that strategy you have that context

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,390
design makes sense and when you do that

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:28,180
work upfront the client can be working

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,890
on the content at the same time you're

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,150
working on the design because you're

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,630
both working from the same strategy so

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,260
again

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,390
design each strategy without content

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,350
strategy and understanding of that the

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:47,110
design is not effective it's just pretty

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,790
strategy gives context right so strategy

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,430
first content first

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:55,540
it means think about the content first

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:57,490
create the plan give people direction of

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:02,770
what they need to write of what needs to

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:06,100
be created right now design brings

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:08,860
visual content or visual context to the

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,630
content strategy so you have a strategy

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,830
in place design makes it visual it

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,860
brings it to life

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,620
now semantic HTML it gives meaning to

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,210
the content for search engines and

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,760
everything and things like that write

00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,260
that HTML the way that you're tagging

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,470
things the way that you're coding things

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:29,320
that's giving it meaning as well

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,780
CSS dictates the appearance of the

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,660
content and the design when you have a

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:37,630
clear strategy in place not only could

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,940
the client be working on content not

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,420
only could the designer be working on

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,460
design but a developer could get started

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,470
at the beginning of a project not

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,500
waiting all the way until design is done

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,780
but a developer could get going at the

00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,520
beginning of the project understanding

00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,030
what the content structure is going to

00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:00,370
be and start getting the basic HTML the

00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,140
semantic HTML done of the structure of

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,750
the site they won't be able to do the

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,820
CSS yet because the designs not done but

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,370
if you're working on rush projects more

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,950
projects with tight timelines doing a

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,890
Content first approach with strategy and

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,630
structure first allows multiple facets

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,110
of your team to all be working towards

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:24,250
the same goal at the same time so what

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:27,440
this means for you new web sites if you

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,899
were working on a brand new website with

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,029
this will help you write one of the very

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,450
first things that you have to do with a

00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:39,180
content first approach is understand the

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,279
goal of the site prioritize the actions

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,680
like we talked about you need to

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,010
document the buyer journey right how do

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,709
they go from a blog post to a conversion

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,899
how do they go from the services page to

00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:55,589
a conversion how do they go from the

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:57,959
home page to a conversion you want to

00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:00,420
look at documenting the site map you

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,579
want to look at the overall content

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,540
structure what is the structure of the

00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,860
content on the actual page itself right

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,760
and that's where we talk about wire

00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,480
framing so all of these things done

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,610
first

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,890
all of a sudden creating your content

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,079
gets much much easier creating the

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,579
design gets much easier if you have had

00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,589
projects where clients have

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,110
procrastinated and delayed and you've

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:27,000
run into delays where the site hasn't

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,980
launched on time because the client

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,529
never got their content done on time or

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,990
you waited and waited and waited for

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,540
content doing this first will help

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,670
eliminate those problems will help

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,440
eliminate those delays because clients

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,350
don't do their content when they aren't

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,390
sure what to do when they have a clear

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,250
roadmap of what needs to be created and

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,990
how it's gonna be used then all of a

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,070
sudden it feels easier and they get it

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,470
done if you're redesigning an existing

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,089
site the process is similar but there's

00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,430
a couple other things you've got to look

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:02,279
at you have to do an audit of all

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,529
existing content on the site you also

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,300
want to look at the analytics what pages

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:08,910
are people visiting and what pages are

00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,740
no is nobody going to write if people

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,300
are nobody you're going to some of the

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,640
pages on the site if the traffic is

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,290
super low it either means nobody cares

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,240
about that or the content on that page

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,570
isn't very valuable so you have to audit

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,370
the content that already exists and you

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,290
want to look at the analytics and find

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,670
out what's going on and how people are

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,060
using the site so you can make educated

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,959
decisions about how to move forward

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,260
another one that's a little bit

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,990
different is outlining content structure

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,030
and content types that's looking at what

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,370
do we have that we're going to

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:43,010
keep what do we have that needs to be

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,680
refined and what do we need that's new

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:49,780
right understanding those things upfront

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:55,180
again creates context for moving forward

00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:59,900
now you can't use the same approach for

00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:04,010
content strategy design development you

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,990
cannot use the same approach for a three

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,820
thousand dollar project as you can for a

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,440
thirteen thousand dollar project as you

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,720
can for a thirty thousand dollar project

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,740
as you can for a three hundred thousand

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:19,160
dollar project and here's the problem

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:23,750
those people that started talking about

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:26,420
a Content first approach those thought

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:29,720
leaders that were looked up to and

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:33,320
revered and looked at as their word

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,890
being gospel they said content first and

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,350
like I said all the sheep said and then

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,420
they all started writing about it

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,060
misunderstanding the whole point here's

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,480
the problem most of those people worked

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,130
with enterprise level clients most of

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,780
those people worked with clients that

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,660
had in-house marketing teams and

00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,550
copywriters and ad agencies and account

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,220
reps and all kinds of things like that

00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:01,610
guess what strategy doesn't work for the

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,650
mom-and-pop shop on the corner the same

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,550
one that works for an enterprise level

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:10,900
company with an in-house creative team

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:16,220
right so you have to look at who are we

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:19,010
in raising my children we're trying to

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,710
make them more self aware of themselves

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,050
and the people around them right know

00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:26,660
your audience understand your

00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:30,380
surroundings but we're also trying to

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:33,890
teach them to know where your content is

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,810
coming from right to be aware of where

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,910
the message they're hearing is coming

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,370
from right and that it may not always

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,200
apply to them or you might have to not

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,820
take it word-for-word you might have to

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,770
not take it so literally you might have

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,580
to look for the part that is relevant to

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:51,890
you so wireframes are kind of a perfect

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,570
example of this you

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,940
a lot of designers and a lot of

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,670
developers that work at the enterprise

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,500
level I've talked to uh I've talked to

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,080
friends that work in the enterprise and

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,370
I work with small businesses and we've

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,050
had discussions and they're like you

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,850
don't wire frame every single project

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:11,390
you're doing it wrong

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:13,190
has anybody even told that I can't be

00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,560
the only person that's heard that are

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,520
you serious all right well I'll own it

00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,180
yes thank you

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,800
uh so no I don't why your frame every

00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,980
project people don't have enough money

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,140
for me to do that on every project right

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,730
like it'll come down to their budget so

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,900
if you take the three thousand thirteen

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,670
thousand thirty thousand three hundred

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,350
thousand dollar project for three

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,580
thousand dollars you cannot afford to

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,680
have me wire frame out your whole

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,620
website like that's a joke I'm not doing

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,120
it for thirteen totally I will wire

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,380
frame it out but more than likely I'm

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,850
doing it on graph paper while I'm

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,430
watching Netflix and then I'll take a

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,780
picture of it on my phone and I send it

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,490
to you and I'm like let's talk about

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,380
this or I pull up the pictures that I

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,150
took of it on my kitchen floor like on

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,850
my giant graph paper and then we're

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,460
looking at him on zoom' because for that

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,080
budget range that's what makes sense for

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,730
a thirty thousand dollar project I'm an

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,400
illustrator and I'm like dialing and

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:08,650
good official wireframes like the legit

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,630
ones for a larger project like that I

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,970
have not I don't do those but my friends

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,340
that do their wireframes are not only

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,010
legit and done but they're talking about

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,070
and outlining the pattern libraries the

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,720
Styles the typefaces they're looking at

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,420
those things all in the wire framing

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,980
phase somebody at $3,000 can't afford

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:33,230
that right so that's a small snapshot of

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,860
looking at content and of looking at

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,300
design and of looking at people in the

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,840
industry in general who are talking

00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:46,190
about how things should be done right if

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,870
you are serving I if you are serving a

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,520
freelancer if you're serving small

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,900
business if you're serving the

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,340
enterprise if you're serving that not

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,530
quite enterprise so you don't have to

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,060
deal with all the bureaucracy lots of

00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,820
people have opinions on how you should

00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,590
be doing business they write blog posts

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,790
about it they speak about it they're

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,990
gonna tell you all the ways that you

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,110
should be doing things and all the

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,000
things that you're doing

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:10,380
but here's the deal they're not always

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,409
right because they may not serve the

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,940
same client base as you they may not

00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,549
have the same you may not have the same

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:21,059
resources they do they may not have the

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:23,190
same background that you do right so

00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:26,779
when you're listening to somebody who

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:29,340
creates some mantra like content first

00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:31,919
go back and look at what kind of clients

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,799
do they work with are they the same as

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,019
yours no okay well let's look at what

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,210
their message is and instead of just

00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,940
taking it for gospel look at what their

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,639
message is and see what piece is

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,940
relevant to your business and your

00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:51,330
clients and what you do because they're

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:54,630
not wrong it just may not be the right

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:57,330
advice for your clients and your

00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,570
business but it said earlier there's no

00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:02,010
one right way to do anything there are

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,409
lots of different ways to get things

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,679
done there's no one way that's the right

00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:10,049
way in one way that's the wrong way

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,169
right but you have to look at what's the

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:15,899
best way for you so when we talk about

00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:20,789
content first when we talk about the

00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:23,250
idea of building projects from not from

00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,840
design you know we look at most of the

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,970
time people outline their design process

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,090
on their website and they're like

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:34,139
discovery design development deployment

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:38,580
like every site ever write contents not

00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:39,840
in there anywhere so for years and years

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,330
and years designers and developers

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,200
talked about we do discovery and then we

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:49,080
do design but I want to look at that

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:54,330
content first approach needs to be we do

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:58,620
discovery we do strategy we do design

00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:01,110
and content right when you have a large

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,179
business that has in-house teams that

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,210
has copywriters that have budgets to

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,190
hire copywriters content process is a

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,190
little bit different you can totally do

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,149
content done first at that level because

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,279
the people you're playing with

00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:16,280
understand what they're doing the

00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,080
mom-and-pop shop around the corner

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,470
the freelancer who's starting their very

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,240
first business either small to

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,700
medium-sized businesses that don't have

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,450
in-house teams they don't build websites

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,340
for a living

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,740
they don't write content for a living

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,770
the extent of their writing is usually

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:37,310
emails or maybe proposals or internal

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:40,550
memos so asking them again to get their

00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:43,010
content done upfront causes problems but

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:46,690
asking them to get their content done

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:50,510
with a strategy mapped out with

00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,610
structure already defined all they have

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:56,450
to do is create according to the plan

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:59,240
that you come up with together all of a

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:01,190
sudden that becomes easier now I talked

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,960
about how I don't wireframe projects at

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,820
$3,000 content first approach and

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,040
content strategy changes based on budget

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,650
as well

00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:15,080
right the kind of strategy you do for a3

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,580
South $3,000 project isn't the same kind

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,440
of strategy you're gonna do for a thirty

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,470
thousand dollar project because their

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,820
budget just doesn't allow it and you

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,660
also are gonna look at the technical

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:29,300
expertise of your clients some clients

00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,750
are gonna understand all that and some

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,820
clients aren't I'm sure maybe you have

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,100
worked with I can't imagine that you

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,840
haven't clients where if you sent them a

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:42,500
wire frame they'd be like what is this

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:46,430
my website is blank I don't understand

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,010
and it would cause you more of a pain

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,780
and more heartache than it was even

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,580
worth it to do the wireframe in the

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,590
first place

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,180
those people you wouldn't do a wireframe

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,070
for because they don't even understand

00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,510
what they're looking at some projects

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,360
are simple enough where you don't need

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,640
to do that content strategy sometimes is

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,710
the same thing so sometimes I'm talking

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,900
with other freelancers I teach a course

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,370
called profitable project plan and I get

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,660
a lot of questions about content and we

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,950
were talking about it on one of the live

00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:19,790
Q&A calls the other day and I said well

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:22,490
some clients like I do content strategy

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,990
for in my head or on paper but I don't

00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,520
actually talk to the client about it

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,779
because they wouldn't understand anyway

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,809
because they're just not at that

00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:34,609
level right they want it done but that's

00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,989
not something they're that they're into

00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:39,139
it's not something I want to dive into

00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:41,690
in their budget range right so sometimes

00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:44,119
I'm doing it internally I'm documenting

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,330
it for my own process and being able to

00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:50,179
do a design that does them justice and

00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:53,210
their goal justice but it may not be

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:57,409
something I dive into deeply with the

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:59,419
client because they simply don't have

00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:02,149
the budget or the technical expertise

00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:03,979
and understanding right so in a lot of

00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:06,859
those cases one of the things that we do

00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:10,159
in our in our agency is when design is

00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:12,859
over all of the approved mock-ups go in

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,450
a Content checklist and I number every

00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:16,789
piece of content in the mock-ups that

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,239
they approve and next to the mock-up in

00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:21,499
the PDF is the number and instructions

00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:22,820
this is what I need this is how many

00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:25,159
characters it should be this how many

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,349
lines it should be and we give the

00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,580
client a content checklist and they look

00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:29,960
at the mock-up and they look at the

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,849
numbers and they look at the

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,349
instructions and they get a word doc

00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:35,330
that matches it and they just fill in

00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:36,679
the blanks and the sense I started doing

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,229
that I've never had a project not

00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:40,909
launched on time because of content but

00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:42,649
it's figuring out what worked best for

00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:43,999
me because I talked to my other friends

00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:44,749
and they're like I would never do

00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:46,129
business like that

00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:49,309
right because you don't work with the

00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:51,769
same kind of clients that I do so

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:56,570
there's only one thing that I want you

00:25:51,769 --> 00:26:00,320
to remember from this talk today is that

00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:03,619
there's no one singular right way to do

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,229
anything you have to do what's best for

00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:08,859
you so when people are out there if you

00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:13,009
hear people talking about content first

00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:18,859
remember it was never intended from day

00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:22,399
one to mean content done first it was

00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:26,089
meant to be think about the content

00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:28,609
first think about the strategy think

00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:30,320
about the structure of the pages think

00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:33,200
about the goal of the site and the

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,999
conversion and how to move people from

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,330
where they're at on the site wherever it

00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:40,429
may be to that conversion and what works

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,619
for you may not work for somebody else

00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:42,950
right if you're reading a blog post and

00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:44,330
someone

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,909
telling you how to do it their strategy

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,309
may not work for you ultimately you have

00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:51,379
to look at your business your skills

00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:53,659
your systems your processes and your

00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:55,419
clients and you have to do what's best

00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:59,539
for you

00:26:55,419 --> 00:27:00,830
so I am Jennifer Bourne that is it for

00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:07,549
today these are all the places that you

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:08,450
can find me very nice and I believe we

00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:11,090
have time for Q&A

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:14,720
absolutely questions perfect do we have

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:19,059
any questions anything related to

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,830
content it looks like you nailed it yes

00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:22,730
I was gonna say there can't be no

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,619
questions

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,249
you said it kind of quickly if you mind

00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:30,080
saying it again about the fort they do

00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:33,049
the fill in the blanks what was it that

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,779
you gave them oh yes is that again so

00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:37,070
the question was can you tell us a

00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,919
little bit more about the content

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:43,090
checklist so if you've heard about a

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,759
piece of software called a Content snare

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:49,070
it's the software version of my process

00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,720
I just figured out this software existed

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,129
a few months ago and I was looking at it

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,830
and I called the guy that built it and I

00:27:52,129 --> 00:28:01,029
said this is the entire thing that I do

00:27:54,830 --> 00:28:04,009
but in software so when we finish design

00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:05,840
the mock-ups that the client approved of

00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:07,820
the custom page templates the home page

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,389
all the templates that they saw and

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,190
approved we drop them into a PDF we is

00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,549
InDesign so I drop them into an InDesign

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:19,700
file and I number each piece of content

00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:20,509
on every mock-up and I do that for a

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,869
couple reasons

00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:27,200
so I number them next to the mock-up are

00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:28,940
all the numbers and instructions what

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,950
that piece of content is and what I need

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,320
from the client if it's in a divine

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,489
space and we haven't already mapped we

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,830
haven't already covered what the

00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:40,879
headlines are I give them a character

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:42,529
count now I say I number them for two

00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:44,840
reasons the pieces of content for two

00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:46,580
reasons the first reason is that in the

00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,320
word templates that I give them and I've

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,970
tried it in Google Docs and other things

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,720
and just everybody knows Microsoft Word

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,369
so the word templates are tables and in

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,509
the tables there's fields and they're

00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:58,820
labeled with the number

00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:01,879
and the labels of what the content is

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,949
that I need and then blank a blank space

00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:05,539
and they just fill it all in so when I

00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:07,459
need to put their content into the site

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:09,799
I open up the word doc for the about

00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:11,629
page and it's number one headline and

00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,979
they put it in it's number two and it's

00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:15,589
this and they put it in it's number

00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:19,249
three three boxes box one headline

00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:20,690
sub-headline 100 word text button text I

00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:22,070
just have to copy and paste copy and

00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,570
paste then I'm not sorting through a

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,299
mess of content that's totally

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,769
disorganized so that's the first reason

00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,929
why I number it because it matches

00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:31,519
what's in my word doc the second reason

00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:33,379
I number it is because when a client

00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,209
calls and they're like I have questions

00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:36,619
about this piece of content I'm like

00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:38,029
what are you talking about like I'm not

00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:39,619
even sure where what page are you

00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:43,069
talking about like just tell me the

00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:44,509
number 17 yes okay no you're talking

00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:47,659
about here let's get this done and we

00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:49,699
can get it done way faster right so from

00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,799
the first thing on the home page to the

00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:54,259
last thing on the last template I go

00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:56,359
from number one to as many as I need I

00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,729
don't start over at number one for each

00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,989
mock-up because then when the client has

00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:01,669
questions I'm just like what number are

00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:03,529
you working on yeah okay let's get it

00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:05,179
done and it just makes it faster for me

00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:06,739
like I'm like how can I get everything

00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,889
done as fast as possible so I make as

00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:12,589
much money as possible so yeah so that's

00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:14,659
that's what we do the first one took a

00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:18,859
long time after that it takes about an

00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:25,909
hour to create each one anybody else

00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:28,249
questions yes thanks for your

00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:31,549
presentation have you ever worked with a

00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:33,769
copywriting company and and coordinated

00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:35,419
with them your project around kind of

00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:40,099
also their process of helping write copy

00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:41,719
for the client yes the question was have

00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:44,419
you ever worked with copywriters to help

00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:47,059
get content done for clients in the past

00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:49,579
I've worked with copywriters for a

00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:51,109
couple reasons I've referred clients to

00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:53,239
copywriters and I'm like you are not

00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:53,989
getting it done like you need to go and

00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:58,759
hire somebody

00:30:53,989 --> 00:31:00,949
so there's copywriters and copy editors

00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,049
so sometimes I refer them to a

00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:05,119
copywriter sometimes I'll refer them to

00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:06,409
a copy editor if they have a knight they

00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,310
can get stuff done but it's just not

00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:11,630
good uh I don't do that anymore

00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,100
because for the last two or three years

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,400
I've written all the content for all the

00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,780
sites we've done so which I actually

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,140
don't even build web sites anymore I

00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:23,450
only do content but uh but yeah so in

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,970
terms of working with copywriters I find

00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,770
bringing them in on the very very first

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,140
kickoff call when the project starts is

00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:32,060
the way to go right a suit the sooner

00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,760
you can bring them in the better it's

00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,260
gonna be so ideally I like to if I'm

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,550
working with a third party copywriter

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,540
with a client because sometimes they

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,880
come to me and they already have a

00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:43,610
copywriter in place I'm like you should

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,490
be on the strategy call to write that

00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,260
way if you have questions about content

00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:52,870
we can nail it all and get it all ironed

00:31:48,260 --> 00:32:03,920
out as well so yeah no problem

00:31:52,870 --> 00:32:06,440
yes over there that's not a question

00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,800
it's more about sharing what I do so I

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,920
know kind of a 3k website I often ask

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,480
the client to do the wireframe so after

00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,490
we have the discovery and we discussed

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,340
their business and what the goals are

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:21,770
and the objectives and and I've never

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,910
had a client reject that idea they've

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,860
always been happy to do it

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,870
oh yeah most they do the version widths

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,430
on a piece of paper the marker and they

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,200
take a shot of it with their phone and

00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,930
they send it to me right works really

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,610
well for me oh yeah her so she didn't

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,980
have a question but she wanted to share

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:40,460
that her clients write their own content

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:42,110
uh their own wireframe mm-hmm their own

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,950
rough wireframe they do their own

00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,020
wireframe

00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,090
well I this is after we've had a

00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,700
strategy discussion and that's your

00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:52,850
theory if a word they do they're really

00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,590
doing and then I advise them if I think

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,180
there's something wrong with it but it

00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,510
really helps because they understand

00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,980
their own business really well Wow I'm

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,810
talking about a three can you wrestle

00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,460
but we must work with clients who

00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:08,330
understand conversion strategy much

00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:11,180
better than mine so that's awesome that

00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,710
that works for you that's great anybody

00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,730
else have what question before we wrap

00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:18,179
up nope great thank you another round of

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,240
applause

00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,240
