Tomorrowland by Disney it's a really

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,420
interesting one and then Harry Potter

cries maybe you have a different list

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,940
but I don't want your list I want you to

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,570
write your list which brings us to 13

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,730
blogging tips from a 13 year old let's

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,560
get right into it

00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:31,670
tip number one take your own photos

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:44,030
maybe they're gonna put that on I don't

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:47,540
know all right take your own photos the

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,310
first part of this is own photos it's

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,850
good to have those in your posts so you

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,580
don't have just a long block of texts

00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,410
that's that's not super exciting spice

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,050
up your site a little bit and put some

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:04,700
photos in there but not only that take

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,050
your own photos why well this this is

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,880
this is from my site

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,690
lol Emma calm you see how I just put

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,120
that right in there go check that out

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,280
and this right here is my very own photo

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,170
is it the best taken photo in the world

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,600
absolutely not but it's mine I took that

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:27,080
it's of my work and that's important

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,489
because two things the first is that you

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,280
are building a connection with your

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,560
audience this is my very own project you

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,470
get to see it and you're seeing a part

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,450
of me now maybe you're not talking about

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,660
a project but you can take a picture

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,450
about what was in your mind's eye when

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:48,050
you were thinking about a concept your

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,030
audience sees that and they see you and

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,370
that that's a connection that you're

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,950
really striving for when you blog the

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,739
other thing is when you get photos from

00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:00,170
stock images your site starts to look

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,690
like every other site out there I'm

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,120
gonna tell you a little story my family

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,400
and I were looking for a handyman and we

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,129
went

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,329
a whole bunch of sites and we started

00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:15,510
seeing the same three images over and

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,329
over and over again you know what pretty

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,850
sure that's not your employee

00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:24,090
that works for all of your your sites

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,550
yeah no those were all stock images but

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,280
when we found one that showed you their

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,729
employees and their projects that they

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,750
had worked on that was the one that's

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:39,870
the one we chose hands down take your

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,910
own photos that's the first tip the

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,520
second is you use headings we already

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,520
talked about long blocks of text nobody

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,000
likes them this is what determines if a

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,889
reader stays on your post or not because

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,830
there's two things to know about this

00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,650
world and whether you like it or not

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:02,010
nobody likes long blocks of text

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:04,949
everybody skims so get the big points

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,530
out there in your headings and between

00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,389
that put a couple of paragraphs not too

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,550
much they use a lot of headings because

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,830
if they're gonna skin you want your

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,660
message out there they're still gonna

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,620
read it does that matter if they read

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,260
every single word that you posted some

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,849
people will and that's great but some

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,710
people won't and you still want your

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:28,199
message out there for them to read it

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,419
you're gonna need headings really

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,310
important that was a fast one number tip

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:37,470
number tip well number two use headings

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,979
I'm pretty sure tip isn't a number I

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:46,530
should check with my math teacher number

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:50,360
three have an opinion I'm in high school

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:54,960
I read textbooks read a lot of books

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,240
facts really boring but if you have an

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,010
opinion on those facts that's where it

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,880
gets really interesting I'd like to hear

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:05,820
that what's your take this is a post

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,449
that I wrote about a song and what this

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,030
song I think means the life lessons that

00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,620
you should take away from a 30-minute

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,450
song how much can you get out of the

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,280
3-minute song some people will say

00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:21,000
basically nothing but

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,070
piÃ±on is that you can get several life

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,820
lessons out of it I go line by line and

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:29,550
I take the facts and then I blow them up

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,720
and I talk about my opinions on each

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,810
fact that's interesting that's important

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,070
that's what your audience wants to hear

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:43,980
so give them that have an opinion

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:49,470
because facts aren't interesting not

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:52,470
helpful your opinion is number four put

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,880
your picture somewhere on the site my

00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:01,830
picture right there

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:04,080
I had bangs probably update that maybe

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,400
that was a mistake I don't know but my

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,890
picture is on the site and it's on the

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,990
sidebar so you can see it when you're at

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,150
the homepage and also while you're

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,620
viewing a post this is another one about

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,970
connection you're gonna get through this

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,410
whole talk and I'm gonna say connection

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,200
a lot connection is the word of the day

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,419
a connection with your audience is super

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,880
important and what makes it's what makes

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,190
you not a ghost at a keyboard when I

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,080
can't see you you are a ghost at a

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,910
keyboard I don't know you I don't know

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,340
who you are why you're putting out your

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,520
facts yes have an opinion but know who

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,850
that opinion is bye so have your picture

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,360
on the site you're building a connection

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:45,570
that's important number five always be

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,960

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:51,270

helpful so keep that in mind as you

write this right here is actually about

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:48,980
speaking this post is about the upsides

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,350
of not using notes and I'm teaching you

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm being helpful and that's the goal

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:58,190
remember that tip number five big number

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,300
remember it always be helpful we're

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:06,680
getting through these pretty fast this

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:10,430
is good tip number six allow comments

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:14,240
this can be scary I know because you

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:16,040
might get hate comments but comments are

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,590
also a great way to connect with your

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,590
audience and that's what we're striving

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:24,140
for you want open communication with

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,540
your audience I've gotten comments that

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:30,200
range from what are you using on your

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,810
site as your theme I'm using Astra all

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,660
the way to how do you know it's right

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:38,630
I'm a blogger and I'm struggling and I

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,180
don't know what to write and I help them

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,210
because help is important we just talked

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,890
about that comments is a great way to

00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,890
connect with your audience and build

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,620
that community that you want however

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,950
like I said it's scary to get hate

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,110
comments mean comments about your post

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,910
yeah this wasn't this wasn't your best I

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,200
don't agree with what you're saying

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,140
because you put your opinion out there

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,350
and I disagree so don't leave anything

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:10,420
and everything that you find to be mean

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:15,640
to you or your community protect them

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:18,290
it's important and tip number seven

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:23,000
don't worry about looks this is my home

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:26,480

beautiful maybe not but that's not

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,530
what's important what's important is the

00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,690
content because people come to your site

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:39,290
not looking for something beautiful to

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,190
look at but to answer a question to know

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,750
about you

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,300
they're coming to your site looking for

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,149
the content so don't focus all of your

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,740
time on what your site looks like focus

00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,560
a little bit of time there and then move

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:57,199
on to your content because that's what

00:10:51,560 --> 00:11:00,529
people are looking for tip number eight

00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:04,430
this is one of the biggest have an about

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:06,019

page is all about you you're going to

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:11,029
tell your audience about yourself why

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,850
should they believe you about your

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:15,920
opinions what's your experience tell

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,370
them some personal stuff - like what's

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,060
your favorite color I don't know make it

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,889
personal

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,720
this helps your audience connect with

00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,720
you in a way that they don't connect

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,089
with some other websites this is my

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,139
about page maybe you've been reading it

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:36,170
I don't know but this helps you connect

00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:38,149
with what I'm saying and this helps you

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,560
know if you'll be able to relate to me

00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:44,839
when I talk about my experiences I have

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,850
a friend her name is Nevada and she

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:53,420
posts about fashion I know her and I

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,720
respect her opinion I respect it more

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,470
than I would respect the opinion of

00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,389
Cosmopolitan yeah they're super

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,610
successful but I don't know who the heck

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:04,160
is writing for them how do I know that I

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,209
can trust what they're saying but I can

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,860
trust my friend

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:11,240
Nevaeh because I know about her now

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,339
there are people across the world that

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,779
don't know about you they aren't your

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,639
personal friends but with your about

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,769
page they can feel like they are your

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,720
personal friends they know you and now

00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:22,990
they feel comfortable with you to go

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,250
into your posts and read them and

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,470
understand you and where you're coming

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,630
from they get it and they will respect

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,470
your opinion too more than they'll

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,470
respect other sites

00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:40,129
tip number 9 finish when your thought is

00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:43,250
out a lot of people struggle with how

00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:46,519
long should my post be should it be 500

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:50,720
words a thousand words twelve words I

00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,770
don't know one of these posts is over 20

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,350
paragraphs long

00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,010
that's intentionality I had a lot to say

00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,589
about that

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,870
don't tell my English teacher this

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,550
because she'll have me do extra work but

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,060
that's over four or five paragraph

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:10,500
essays and I wrote that in like one

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,930
night the other isn't even five

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,089
paragraphs I didn't have a lot to say

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,800
about pen pals I thought it was an

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,360
important post but there's not much to

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,709
say about it you explain what it is you

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,240
explain why it's important boom you're

00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:28,170
done there's not really a perfect place

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,540
to end your post because it's not really

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,640
important what's important is that your

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,649
thought is out your content is out there

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:44,399
people will read it if you're using your

00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:47,399
headers so don't think alright I've got

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,200
to make it 500 words keep writing keep

00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,700
writing keep writing I have to make it

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,890
to a thousand words keep writing keep

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,310
writing keep writing 2,000 words it's

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,720
not how far you can go finish when your

00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,850
thought is out when you've completed

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,649
what you're going in with what you're

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,850
gonna try and say when you're done with

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,209
that when you've written what you can

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:10,500
write you're done and that's it and then

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:12,870
you hit publish and you're done but you

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,930
don't have to hit publish there's this

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,660
handy-dandy little button called save

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,910
draft I really like this because you can

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,700
tinker with a post and until it feels

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:26,279
just right especially if it's a post

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,649
that's near and dear to your heart some

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,290
of those posts that are really important

00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:32,910
to you will come out super fast you'll

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,770
write it all in one night and it'll be

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,570
great and it's perfect you're like

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,300
alright I just did that because your

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,310
heart knows what it wants to say others

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,110
you'll want to mess around with for a

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,240
bit you want to make sure that what

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,820
you're putting out there is what you

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,920
truly believe so hit the save draft

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:54,060
until you're ready to publish don't

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,190
leave it in your drafts forever but it's

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,800
okay to use that you don't have to be

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:03,860
done with a post after you're finished

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:08,690
with your first draft but by all means

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,790
hit publish this is not from my site it

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:15,490
is actually from my lovely mother's

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,490
right here in the first row say hi mom

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,220
she runs a site called gifted live.com

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:26,450
go check that out it's a lot of stories

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:30,529
about me and my brother so maybe don't

00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:33,230
don't check it out but yeah she is a

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,899
victim of the infamous imposter syndrome

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,550
she doesn't want to hit publish she's so

00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:41,870
afraid to hit publish what if it's not

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:44,029
good enough but her posts are great so

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:47,300
figure out for you what its gonna take

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,579
to hit publish for my mom she likes to

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,170
run it by me and then my brother and

00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,149
then my dad and then like five other

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,529
people on Facebook I don't know she

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,209
likes to check back to the prompt which

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,300
is usually a question asked by someone

00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:00,459
on Facebook and then she's like alright

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:06,290
I'm ready

00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:09,470
click for me a long time it was asking

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:12,529
my dad hey is this alright just a good

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:16,880
post now I just have to take a deep

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:20,420
breath be ready and hit it because I've

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,060
been blogging for five years whatever it

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:28,250
takes for you to feel comfortable enough

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:31,040
to hit publish that's what it is use it

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:35,200
do it over and over and over and over

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,200
again until eventually all it takes is

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:44,770
click number 12 this one is one of the

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:49,990
hardest to follow

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:54,079
keep at it I had a really hard time with

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:56,810
keeping at it for most of that five

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,790
years there were times where I would

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,380
take three months off of blogging

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,720
because I didn't know if I was gonna

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,449
have anything good to say the most

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,290
recent one of those was I blogged in

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,699
October and didn't blog again until like

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,730
two weeks ago

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:15,620
because I was so nervous you're probably

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,050
wondering now why am i listening to her

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,410
but

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,300
but it's okay to take breaks you have to

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,860
keep at it

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,329
take breaks with the promise that you're

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,670
gonna come back and write more don't

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,030
throw the side away don't say I'm never

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:34,220
doing this again because you should you

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,600
should keep going and eventually you'll

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,040
get into the groove of it and you'll

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,590
keep ready and you'll keep writing and

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,410
you're enjoying it again but don't give

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:45,800
up this is my post dashboard it's full

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:48,559
of posts and yours might not be there

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,570
yet and that is perfectly okay because

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,640
it took me a really really long time to

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:56,120
get here don't check the dates on those

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,250
there are big gaps in between but yeah

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,309
it'll take time because you have to keep

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,120
going over and over and over again keep

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,679
hitting publish

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,679
save draft and then hit publish again

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,690
this last tip is one that not a lot of

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:15,370
people want to hear I get a lot of

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:18,170
excuses but you will find your voice a

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,300
lot of people have questions about how

00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:23,600
do I find my voice well how do I know

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:28,460
what words to use is this word too big

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,470
or like is it too simple how do I know

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,460
what punctuation I should be using

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:37,309
should I use that semicolon is this a

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,440
comma splice is that okay is this

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,770
creative writing or formal writing I

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,380
don't know what to say don't be worried

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:48,770
because it will come naturally with time

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,140
with keeping at it and you'll start

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:54,110
recognizing it it's not about choosing a

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,570
voice it's about letting your voice come

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,740
to you do you use a lot of compound

00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:03,679
sentences when you write maybe you do

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:06,760
that's your voice it's a post or I have

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,500
a question mark and an exclamation point

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,269
and a heart

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,889
throws this when I was like little okay

00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:18,600
don't judge me that's my voice that's

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,879
how I write I write really casually

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,419
maybe you read it like this is like your

00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:27,330
college entry essay if that's how you

00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:32,700
write good right like that that's

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:34,679
totally fine but don't try to go looking

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,450
for your voice because your voice is

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,610
already there and it's inside you and

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,190
you just have to wait until you find it

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,409
and when you find it it'll be a big

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:47,539
moment for you you realize I've had this

really really long time to compile this

00:19:54,289 --> 00:20:00,929
like writing the speech didn't take too

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,149

jesse has a microphone since all right

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,500
so as a miner how do you feel how safe

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,910
do you feel about sharing personal

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,840
information online I don't I don't share

00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:21,810
specifics I don't share names I don't

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:25,440
share a lot of things but a story is a

00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:28,830
story what happens in my life I I do

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:33,050
blog about my life I blog about life

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:37,170
lessons what does a 13 year old know but

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:39,630
but I do know a couple things and I keep

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,850
that there and it's stories and it isn't

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,580
about my life and I do feel comfortable

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:47,700
sharing that but I don't give a lot of

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:52,410
specifics so yeah I'm not going to put

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:57,870
out my address but no specifics just the

00:21:52,410 --> 00:22:03,600
stories just the lessons this is my

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:08,190
brother what do you want to know how

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:12,080
would you get out of a point in time

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:15,690
where you haven't been blogging well

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,540
it's hard I have to sit back down at my

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:21,450
computer most of the time when I don't

00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,460
right it's not because I've been sitting

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,610
at a blank page it's mostly because I've

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,080
been like I don't have time or I don't

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,310
have anything right but when you sit

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,880
down into a computer and you have a

00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:34,830
blank page you got to fill it you have

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,540
to write something I like to think about

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,440
what's been happening in my life

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:42,690
recently since the last time I blogged

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,220
so the last time I blogged with that big

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,290
stretch that I was talking about I had

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,120
blogged about October because it was

00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,600
October that's an hour thing I blog

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,050
about art a little bit more now and I

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,150
had realized that since

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,650
I've gotten really into bullet

00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,640
journaling so I thought I'd post about

00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:02,320
that so when you've taken a time off

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,180
open up your computer set up that blank

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,390
page think about what's happened in your

00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,290
life since you last posted something

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:18,100
will ring a bell

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:20,500
write it that's it Emily

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,570
great job if I worked in corporate world

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,150
and I have a I've seen a lot of

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:31,930
presentations and yours is top notch

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:33,370
really really I guess a question for you

00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,140
so I'm trying to relate right so I'm

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,030
going back I'm gonna say how many years

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,740
but do you ever find when you're

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,810
blogging is there any kind of social

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,310
pressure to cater your content around

00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,220
maybe what you're hearing from friends

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,390
and stuff like that or do you manage do

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,160
you manage to keep true to your own

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,760
voice and only write about those things

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:56,110
that's truly coming from you that's

00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:59,460
that's a really good question I didn't

00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:03,640
really share my blog with my friends

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:06,850
until I got Instagram which was a couple

00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:10,090
months ago so I never felt like my

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,860
friends were watching it was mostly my

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:15,070
parents my parents friends a whole bunch

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:18,610
of adults and I never felt a lot of

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:20,430
pressure from them now that I do have

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,740
friends watching

00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,050
I will admit it's a little scarier to

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,390
write about life lessons because when

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,420
faced with my friends it feels like I

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,370
don't know much which is why I turned

00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:37,120
more to art where I know that I know

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:40,870
what I'm talking about so there is a bit

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,900
of pressure but my my quote-unquote

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,790
voice is still the casual tone it's

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,910
always been when I'm having a

00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:51,000
conversation what I write about just

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,910
kind of changed and I think it changed

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,830
even before I shared my blog with my

00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,020
friends that I knew that I was getting

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:02,350
more into art and that was where I was

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,650
going to go with this so yeah a little

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,650
bit of pressure

00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:16,180
how often do you blog like how many

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,490
posts do you think is a good amount to

00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:24,580
do during a week during a week I don't

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,750
know about you guys but being a freshman

00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,700
in high school there's a lot that I'm

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:35,010
doing so I post as much as I can but

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:37,270
usually it's only about once a week and

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,730
there's there's a lot in my life and I'm

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,580
sure that with adults is the same that

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:46,090
you have work and stuff so just try and

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,460
try and fit it in where you can but life

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,340
happens so I tried to stick to about one

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:55,360
a week if I can because I know I have

00:25:51,340 --> 00:26:00,760
the weekends but yeah what a week is a

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:04,200
good place to start I just want to know

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,200
how you were introduced to WordPress

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:12,870
that is a lovely story

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:18,310
well my dad found a wordpress first and

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:20,620
this dude right here super cool great

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,900
blogger I don't know where he's at right

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,630
now but he used to blog like every

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,220
single day he's been working in

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,140
WordPress for the longest time and I

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,560
remember I was at like a Christmas party

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,860
and I turned to my dad and I'm like dad

00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:40,000
you blog he's like yeah I do

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:43,030
and I'm like one can I get a blog he's

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,290
like when you're 8 I was seven at the

00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:50,140
time there was there was a good year and

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:52,360
of course in his mind it was like it's a

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,610
seven year old in a year she's gonna

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,330
totally have forgotten about this now

00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:01,450
while most dad's wake up - good morning

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:03,090
dad my dad woke up - dad I'm so excited

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,360
I'm gonna get a blog

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,649
and I said that every day until I was 8

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,320
and he's like alright well I got to get

00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:21,059
her a blog at this point so that's my

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:22,499
WordPress story it's really more fit so

00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,499
you talk about not having to publish

00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:28,740
every time you start a story kind of 2

00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:31,529
part is based on how many incomplete

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,330
posts do you have right now and what do

00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:36,210
you do with posts that just go nowhere

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,999
halfway through it well the first part

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:43,169
how many incomplete do I have right now

00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:46,139
none at the moment I try to go back and

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:48,210
tinker with that post if I'm feeling

00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:50,279
like writing and then publish it because

00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,570
coming back with a fresh look and saying

00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,519
this is gonna be my post for the day

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,639
that's really helpful to not leave a

00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,869
whole bunch of drafts in there but if I

00:27:56,639 --> 00:28:00,749
know that this is gonna take a long time

00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:04,049
I'll move on to the next one as of right

00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:08,330
now I don't have any ink completes when

00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:11,039
a post is really gonna go nowhere I

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,960
realized that it's it's not the right

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,240
post to write that I clearly don't know

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,840
enough about this topic to write about

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,999
it so I usually scrap it until I dunno

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,580
I'll write down what I was gonna write

00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,440
about but I scrap it until further

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,860
notice when I do know what I'm talking

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,840
about

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,769
more and then I go back to that prompt

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,769
and I rewrite it

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,380
so do you keep a journal or long-running

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:51,289
list of topics that you'd like to talk

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:51,289
about to blog about in the future I

00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:03,899
don't know there's there's a lot I keep

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,510
yes I I don't think I can walk into any

00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:09,269
store that sells journals without buying

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,600
one unless I don't have money with me

00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:16,529
and if not then my mother does and I

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,360
have to ask her and you say how many

00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:24,659
journals do you already have and I'm

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:27,960
like thirty give or take ten but yeah

00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:31,740
there's a lot and some of them are blank

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,570
but some of them do have a purpose where

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,799
I write about my day-to-day stuff I can

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,769
look back into there and say alright

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,210
what's been happening in my life lately

00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:41,639
what have I learned

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,470
go back to an entry where I had a

00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:46,380
question like I don't know how to deal

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:48,299
with this clearly it's past so how did I

00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,990
deal with it I can write about that I

00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:53,549
also have this this handy-dandy iPhone

00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:56,519
so if an idea comes on the fly I can

00:29:53,549 --> 00:30:01,940
write it down in my Notes app which I

00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:04,409
currently have like 50 notes a lot so

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,929
yeah I have a lot of journals I have a

00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:13,950
Notes app with lots of notes in them

00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:16,620
because ideas come all the time this

00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:20,809
might be a stupid question but when do

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,809
you know you've made it as a blogger ah

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,450
that that's a really hard one for me

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:34,529
because I've got this amazing role model

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:37,830
right here that has made it and I always

00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:40,590
look up to him so I still haven't made

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:44,669
it because I'm not I'm not like him yet

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:47,340
I don't get asked to speak at word camps

00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:48,220
I don't go to several word camps per

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,350
month

00:30:48,220 --> 00:31:15,309
I don't have a bazillion people reading

00:30:50,350 --> 00:31:18,850
all the time so the question is how do

00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:21,779
you know when you've made it I will tell

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:24,159
you this when I first started writing

00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:26,139
for a period of three years I wrote

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,610
every single day seven days a week for

00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:30,639
three years straight on just WordPress

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:34,240
right so when I started you know I had

00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:36,610
like twelve views and then thirty views

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,580
and then fifty views in one day I got a

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:42,100
hundred views I called my wife into my

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:47,500
office and I'm like look at this Google

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:55,870
curve like I just and she said don't

00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:59,340
worry it'll go back so I think you know

00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,340
you've made it when the haters show up

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:07,029
you know when the haters show up then

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,159
you're in a good spot I also say that

00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:12,159
well it took him a very long time to get

00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,620
to a hundred he has some lovely friends

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,419
that decided let's get as many people to

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,259
get to Emily's site for her first post

00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:32,110
as possible and I got a hundred in a day

00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:34,210
that felt like made it what happens when

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,310
you you sit in the splash zone right

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,710
there

00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:40,330
[Applause]

00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:50,440
[Laughter]

00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:50,440
welcome to my stand-up comedy me again

00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:58,539
back on yeah so seeing how you influence

00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,399
to get into word price by your parents

00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:04,490
do they let you admin or do they keep

00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:06,350
their hands off they do they they not

00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:10,549
they keep their hands off

00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:13,309
they let me write what I write for a

00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:15,529
long time I showed my post to my dad but

00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:16,909
that was of my own free will I wanted

00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:19,970
his approval

00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:21,500
I don't I don't even know when the last

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,659
time he checked my post before I

00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,190
published it was because they've been

00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:27,190
super great about letting me run this

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:45,980
yeah usually I go to my dad for that

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:49,010
because yeah yeah so I'll go to him for

00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:52,070
that because he he knows a lot of

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:55,460
options so he helps me out with that a

00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:59,809
lot but post wise they keep their hands

00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:03,789
off most of the time I got a follow up

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:03,789
question what's your favorite plugin

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,049
we're gonna find out I plug-in Palooza

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:21,790
I think we have time for one more

00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:29,690
question

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:32,060
I know you said that there's really no

00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,909
amount of words that you need to have on

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:38,210
your blog but I'm finding that when I

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,730
well in the since I just started that

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:44,540
they do seem to have a number that they

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,889
say you should follow but I don't what's

00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,629
your take on that I mean I know you said

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,119
that there really isn't a number of

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,940
words but should it be like it's like at

00:34:50,119 --> 00:35:07,030
least 200 or at least you know what I'm

00:34:52,940 --> 00:35:07,030
saying if you have an you take it and I

00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:15,890
mean we just talked about keeping your

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:18,440
hands off that was your website so I'll

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,940
keep my hands off your blog so you're

00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,920
gonna get a lot of opinions on length

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:26,330
you're gonna get a lot of opinions this

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,369
is just one more opinion but that I

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:31,340
think the the thing that she said is the

00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:33,740
most important thing which is get the

00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,410
thought out and be done right because

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,090
you're still writing for people so if it

00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,140
takes you 200 words it takes you seven

00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,400
hundreds for something different and

00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,080
1200 words for something different get

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,150
the thought out do it well be helpful

00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,780
all the stuff she mentioned and in

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:49,970
general the you know the the minds

00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,970
behind Google will continue to adjust

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:55,400
their answers to what audiences end up

00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:57,290
wanting but you will still hear people

00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,640
say well if it's under 300 it's not

00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,320
going to be part of the social graph

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,250
that Google's gonna make of the article

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,380
and therefore you're not going to get

00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:06,050
indexed people will say well if it's not

00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,460
you know the average it's fifteen to

00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,080
twenty-five hundred words is what's

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,150
getting the most traction and the most

00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,550
backlinks and of course backlinks are a

00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:15,200
function of what we do right we go ooh

00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:18,560
that's a great resource let me link to

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,690
that right so Google is a follower of

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,890
what all of us are doing and so that

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,799
answer is always going to adjust

00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,189
depending on how

00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:28,109
adjust but if you follow thee I'm gonna

00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:30,119
be helpful and I'm gonna write until I'm

00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:32,369
done and then I'm done and I'm not gonna

00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,049
add more to it just to make it fluff I

00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:47,239
think you'll be in a relatively good

00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:47,239
spot all right thank you guys very much

00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,800
