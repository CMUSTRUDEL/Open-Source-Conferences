and is this on can you hear me great

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,000
awesome

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,150
I'm gonna ask my friend Nathan if he has

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,560
a dollar Nathan do you have a single

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,800
dollar bill why don't you bring it up

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,570
here for a second I find that this

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,180
illustration will probably be more

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,770
impactful especially to Nathan than to

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,570
the rest of anyone else but more

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,160
impactful than most of the talk so

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,239
Nathan I want you to give me that dollar

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,329
and I'm gonna give you five you want to

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:46,109
make that trade here you go perfect

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:48,239
thank you very much yeah Steve Steve's

00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,519
now ready he wanted to see it work for

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,640
Rio before he got up with his money but

00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:58,859
here's the deal right how many of you

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,989
would make that trade show hands okay

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,329
some of you are liars cuz you'd be like

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,379
well there's a there's a catch

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,060
I don't know what the catch is but I'm

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,080
not gonna do it so I'm just gonna stand

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,820
here and act like I would do it but I'm

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,250
not gonna do it because I'm not willing

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,340
to lose my dollar right it turns out a

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,930
lot of people do that in terms of most

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,670
studies that are done on college

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,200
campuses where they ask how much would I

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,789
have to give you to swap for a dollar

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,979
like if I give you two dollars would you

00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,509
give me a dollar right and what happens

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,810
if I flip a coin if you get a heads or

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,750
tails

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,060
if I eat time you get your heads that

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,649
versus Mike you know tails I'll pay you

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,869
twice the amount of what you'd pay me

00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,070
and it just goes on and on where people

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,770
like no I'm not willing to do the deal

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,560
until you get to that five to one ratio

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,719
right so we're risk averse that's what

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,689
most of us are that's just that's just a

00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,329
known fact we're risk averse and yet

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,490
that kind of deal where I give you five

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,670
for every one dollar it's kind of a

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,560
no-brainer it's kind of a no-brainer and

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,299
what I want to spend the next 30 to 40

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,270
minutes doing is walking you through

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,999
other no-brainers where you can take

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,520
what you normally make online if you're

00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:08,820
running an online store and just make

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,350
more money you go rip seriously like

00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,540
this now sounds like an infomercial I

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,610
want you to make more money and you have

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,260
to barely do any work and none of

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,920
requires you giving me any of your money

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,270
but the reality is you have customers

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,600
who instead of giving you five dollars

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,170
or giving you one dollar and you could

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,110
do just a few little things to push that

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,370
average order volume up and that's what

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,890
we're gonna spend our time talking now

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,820
does that make sense all right I know

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,800
you just had lunch

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,740
you're little tired but this is going to

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,660
be interactive so let's get into it all

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,920
right how many heard about cart

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:50,670
abandonment right yeah it turns out the

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:55,290
stat that most people know is that 70%

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:57,900
of the carts initiated online right you

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,410
put something in your cart 70% are never

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,510
brought to completion right so 7 out of

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,459
10 people put something in a cart and

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:11,310
then they get distracted or they get

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,620
interrupted or they're just not sure or

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,510
the shipping prices too expensive or

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,280
they're not going to get it in the time

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,470
that they wanted and so what happens

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,250
they just go I'll forget it I'm not

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:26,730
gonna do it some of us put things in our

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,830
cart really late at night any of you do

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,680
that any of you're willing to admit you

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,510
do that right I'm only willing to admit

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,820
it now because there's so many of you

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,170
between my wife and me right so I know

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,180
that if she starts racing you know

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,370
chasing up me up here I know I got

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,980
enough protection the reality is I put a

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,870
lot of things in my cart late at night

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,010
right you lay in bed or it's late and

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,780
you're just sitting on the couch and you

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,340
start browsing something you go I should

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,780
get that and then you there's a tiny

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,400
little voice that goes maybe you

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,370
shouldn't so you just leave it in your

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,200
cart and unfortunately what happens

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,980
right that shows up as cart abandonment

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,390
to most store owners 7 out of 10 people

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:08,090
don't do it but what if I were to tell

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,930
you that we are causing our own problem

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,760
what if I were to tell you that the

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,700
store owner the store developer the

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,220
store designer is contributing to the

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:21,269
problem that's something we could

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,280
control right so here's the dynamic

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,470
right someone views a product they add

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,500
it to their cart and then they leave and

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,150
you go that just doesn't seem like

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
the right order of operations I want

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,950
them to add it to the cart go to

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,200
checkout and pay so what's going on

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,020
right well I want you to take a look at

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:44,010
this site alright if you see on the

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,680
screen here this is Magna titles and

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,980
magna tiles has this beautiful little

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:57,450
thing right over here right I think

00:04:49,980 --> 00:05:00,930
maybe I have to point over here apply

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:06,770
coupon right you see that big apply

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:10,200
coupon that button is a call to action

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:14,190
apply coupon how many of you have ever

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:18,419
seen an apply coupon button on your cart

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,300
or checkout page yeah okay let's look at

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,310
the next one right this is Miss Jones

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,140
baking you put vanilla cake in a cup

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,850
which I don't know what vanilla cake in

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,360
a cup is but it sounds like something I

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,640
should try vanilla Cape in a Cape cake

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,330
in a cup right you put in your cart and

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:41,090
what do you get

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh another apply coupon right big button

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:48,090
right here put your coupon in now how

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:55,830
many of you have a coupon for Miss Jones

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:58,680
ah no right so so what do we do ho

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:01,500
you mean you leave the site and you go

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,890
to Google and you start typing in stuff

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,750
in Google like coupon code for cupcake

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,090
in a cup and then all of a sudden psych

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,770
do you want cupcakes by the dozens and

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,600
you're like what subscription to

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,800
cupcakes weekly and you're like huh and

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,020
all of a sudden you're browsing other

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,910
sites and guess what you never checked

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,890
out it mrs. Jones right you view the

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,050
product you Add to Cart and you leave

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,570
why because we're looking for coupon

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,940
codes and that's what everyone's doing

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,040
they're looking for coupon codes and

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,800
because they're looking you sent them

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,419
away you're the one that did it or the

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,270
designer or the developer or the store

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:42,210
owner we created the situation right now

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,639
take a look at Nike this is nice

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,919
check out now if you take a look you see

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,360
hey free shipping for members that's a

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,479
nice little deal it reminds you to log

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,310
in over here you have the product you

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,430
have two buttons that are highlighted

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:59,729
right checkout and PayPal those are the

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:04,889
buttons now the truth is there is a

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:08,550
coupon code area there do you see it do

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:10,590
you have a promo code but it's written

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,509
in the same area a subtotal estimation

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,370
of handling estimated tax it's just a

00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,320
line of text and in fact you have to

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,210
click a little drop down for it to pop

00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,000
up and show you the code it does not

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,320
distract you in fact most of time if you

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,930
were looking at these shoes like I was

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,789
looking at it late at night you get to

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,500
this step and then you're like check out

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:32,539
or PayPal PayPal is even better it's

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,800
fake money it's not even my money right

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,720
somebody paid me and PayPal I have

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,490
PayPal money so those are like free

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,690
shoes I don't have to tell Melissa that

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,780
I spent any money it doesn't hit our

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,580
books I just get a new set of shoes all

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,430
right how you think about these ok so

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,810
you click a button you click a button

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,970
and boom there goes the shoot and you're

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,610
like this is awesome this was great why

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,520
because they didn't put a big button on

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,320
the cart or checkout page that said hey

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,300
do you happen to have a coupon to get a

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:07,229
discount and we went no let's go google

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:09,930
it ok it's not the coupons are bad it's

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:11,759
how we implement them and so the first

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,409
thing we want to talk about today right

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,300
the first tile I want to show you is how

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:20,669
to navigate this in a better way that

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:24,449
sound good awesome

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:28,680
ok so here is the WooCommerce settings

00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:31,800
screen and on this screen you'll see two

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,520
options that say hide on cart page and

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:39,240
hide on checkout page there are actual

00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,349
options and you can say that button that

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,180
Chris was showing me on all our

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:46,950
WooCommerce stores how do i how do I

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,910
hide it two little check boxes but

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,770
you're going to go wait a minute those

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,060
check boxes aren't in WooCommerce I

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,760
don't see them in the settings page I've

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,300
never seen those before you're right you

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,510
need to add an extent

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,610
to make that available but what's nice

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:05,880
is the same extension that does that

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:09,340
also lets you create URL coupons okay

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,250
URL coupons are coupons you define in

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,280
the same way 10% off 15% 20% off

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,110
whatever you define the URL you take

00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,300
that URL and you send it to those

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,500
customers you mail it to people will

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,110
show you lots of other options you could

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,730
do with them but when the URL is clicked

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:30,040
when people are doing something then

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:33,130
they get the coupon applied still no

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,500
need for the coupon box right this is

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,950
your coupons and it gives you that

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:43,420
ability right so here it is URL coupons

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:45,610
for a single site it's $49 now some of

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,810
you go for ten dollars that's a lot of

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,440
money to spend for this one little

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,780
feature sure but that's not the way you

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,270
need to evaluate the decision right you

00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,910
evaluate the decision by how often am i

00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,530
sending people away from my site how

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,080
might you do that well you could go into

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,120
Google from Google you could go look at

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,950
your checkout page and you could look

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,900
and see how many people are leaving and

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,170
going to Google from your checkout page

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,090
that will quantify your lost sales and

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,940
then all of a sudden you'll be like yeah

00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,890
$49 like that's nothing does that make

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,120
sense

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:29,110
now even better even better than that

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:34,780
are Auto applying discounts how many of

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:38,590
you are old enough to remember when cell

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:41,890
phones had day time rates evening rates

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,930
and weekend rates am I the only one no

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,200
there's a few of you yeah okay

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:50,010
and here's the dynamic right when you

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,300
bought a cell phone in those days right

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,070
when you bought a phone in those days

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,030
what happened was you were always

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,440
worried about what time you're gonna

00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,850
make the call but also you'd have

00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,960
overage fees you'd have you know the

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,910
rates would change and then you'd have

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,350
to try and negotiate with the carrier if

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,640
you didn't want to pay a bigger bill and

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,900
you had all these things and then

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,360
sometimes you wouldn't use all the

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,400
minutes and you were like hey if I'm not

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,220
using if I if I basically

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,620
you know no longer needed the plan that

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,210
I'd been on and I started using less why

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,720
wouldn't you just automatically move me

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:22,780
to a lower plan so I could pay less if

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,910
you ever voice that out loud the person

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,120
the teenager working on the other side

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:30,010
of the desk would just laugh out loud

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,600
right like we're never gonna give you a

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,640
better rate just because you're not

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,970
using the plan you signed up for we're

00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,040
just gonna keep charging you duh right

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,630
now some of you were like I'm not that

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,700
old right I don't remember what your

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,370
time at at all but some of you even are

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:49,000
young enough to go to a gym or I should

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,770
correct that buy a gym membership right

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,260
how many of you have bought a gym

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,080
membership in January and never seen it

00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:01,570
the 11 months after that you don't have

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:03,280
to raise your hand I can just tell the

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,510
reality is right we do those things

00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,620
where we're like hey I haven't used it

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,450
in 11 months why don't you just give me

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,980
a give me my money back like I'm even

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,200
walked in the door and they're like no

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,690
never I'm going to charge you the full

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,800
amount of whatever contract you signed

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,150
but wouldn't it be great if they gave us

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,190
a discount that we deserved wouldn't be

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,780
great if they adjusted my rate based on

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,960
what we were using so you go well I

00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,370
would love to do that on my store right

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,260
so how do I do it right in this

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,030
particular example you'll see I put

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,020
something in the cart and when I put

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:35,050
something in the cart it shows me hey

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:38,950
you're a first-time buyer so I have

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,500
given you 15% off just want to thank you

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,880
for being a great customer especially

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,460
it's your first time in my store now

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,930
some of you have seen first-time buyer

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,280
discounts but you've seen them

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,410
differently right you show up on a

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,000
website you just got there two seconds

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,020
in and things are like popping up like

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,700
give me your email and then I'll give

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,100
you 10% off and do it and you're like no

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,530
I'd prefer not to name our children

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,060
before our first date right you're not

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,950
ready for that relationship I'm not

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,390
giving you my email yet but they're like

00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,000
just anything to give you that 10%

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,230
discount here you could just say look

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,640
it's your first time here it's your

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,589
first time buying something you've never

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,580
purchased anything before I'm going to

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:18,160
automatically give you a discount how do

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,589
you do that well there is a product

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,850
called WooCommerce discount rules Pro

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:26,180
and discount rules

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,579
Pro let's you say hey I'm gonna name

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,279
this my new customer 15% discount is

00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,779
first purchase 15% off right and then

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,870
we're going to go into it and you're

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:38,089
gonna say hey I that checkbox says I

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,300
don't want this to apply for items on

00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:43,970
sale right so that's fair and then over

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,459
here purchase history number of previous

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,380
orders are less than or equal to zero

00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,630
and the order status should be completed

00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,029
what it's saying is go look at the

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,220
orders for this person's email check to

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:57,440
see if in the completed scenario there

00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,300
are more than one and if so this is not

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,089
a new customer do not automatically

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,089
apply this discount does that make sense

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,730
here you can say okay I want 15% it

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,660
could be 10% it could be 12% it could be

00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:18,110
whatever you like okay well what if I

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,560
want to go further right what if I want

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:24,529
to use an approach that is like hey buy

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:28,009
one get one free or particularly the

00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:30,949
better strategy would be buy three get

00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:33,740
one free you go wait why is that better

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:37,819
well because once you put one in your

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,959
cart I can engage you to put a second

00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:41,660
one in because the third one will be

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,550
free right and I'm actually driving your

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,680
volume up again right that's what I want

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,810
is I want your cart value to go up so I

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,910
say heads up you got one in if you put a

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,529
second one in your third which is

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,269
another one in your third will be free

00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,709
right so there's a little bit of

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:56,329
psychology to it but what I really want

00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:59,420
is the discount to automatically apply

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:01,939
and what I'm up beyond that is I want

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,730
the discount to apply while always

00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:07,250
choosing the cheapest product to be set

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,649
to zero right I don't want you to buy a

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,779
seven dollar item an eight dollar item

00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,670
and a fifteen dollar item and give you

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,339
the fifteen dollar discount I want to

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,800
get seven eight fifteen and then give

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,589
you the seven dollar item for free the

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,180
same tool the same plugin right will let

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:25,130
you do that so you come in and you say

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:30,350
okay I want to do the buy two get one

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:32,059
free right this is going to be a buy one

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,189
get one rule right so the BOGO that you

00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:36,540
see their quantity category product user

00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:39,660
role is what we're talking about when we

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:42,210
get into the actual conditioning we go

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,680
okay I want you to check across the

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,580
count of all my items because that's

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,270
part of what I'm doing I'm looking

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,370
aggregate across the cart and then on

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,200
the next one you'll see I want to do the

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,310
min quantity three the max quantity five

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,440
so I'm saying hey when we get to 3 and

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:01,110
all the way up to 5 when we get to 3 is

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,690
when we trigger this use where I look

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,260
for the cheapest one right and I give

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:09,510
100% discount on the cheapest one and

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,520
that's how I get the discount to

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:16,050
automatically apply in both the cart and

00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:19,680
the checkout that make sense right

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:24,990
this is discount rules for WooCommerce

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,870
right Pro again $39 if you take people

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,850
who average on an average cart have a

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,760
single item and you move them to put a

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:35,940
second or a third in their cart you can

00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,070
double or triple the quantity in the car

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,350
trouble double or triple the average

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,870
order value we have customers at liquid

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,610
web where I work where we've helped them

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,950
implement this and we've seen all their

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,700
average orders go up right and you go

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,470
this is awesome and it's just because no

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,670
one's leaving the site for a coupon code

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:59,640
they're just getting them Auto apply

00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:03,900
okay now the problem with Auto applied

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,090
coupons is people don't know them if you

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,440
show up to a site and you put one

00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,940
t-shirt in your car and then you put

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,980
another t-shirt in your cart you don't

00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,360
know that the third t-shirt is the magic

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,040
one that gets you the free one right

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,990
there's nothing that tells you that and

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,450
so we have to educate people we have to

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,120
motivate people and that's what we have

00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,980
to do because now we've hidden that

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,960
discount code and now we've said oh I'm

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,820
gonna I'm gonna apply it in the cart or

00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,000
checkout I need to do it long before you

00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:32,970
get to Carter checkout right so here's a

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,430
sample store right it's the store that

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,130
has all WordCamp t-shirts right this is

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,810
an only Orange County of course so these

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,170
are work camp Orange County t-shirts and

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:45,000
what you'll see is hey if someone puts

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,730
this item in the cart right you can see

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,230
that across the top this has been added

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,310
to your cart and then you see this

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,190
pop-up that comes up

00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,840
and says hey way to go you added

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,940
something to your cart you had a t-shirt

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,510
I just wanna let you know if you had a

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,270
second your third is free right and I

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,190
can use did you know language I can use

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,980
great news language I can use lots of

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,080
language that drives you to make another

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,560
purchase I can just leave it as a

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,480
notification or I can put a button on

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,460
the bottom of that right and on the

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,230
button I can say hey go shopping or go

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,040
look at this category or go look I can

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,140
send you anywhere I want that make sense

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:29,520
right the tool I'm using there is a tool

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:32,430
called ahoy and know who has a variety

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,160
of settings you'll see here right I can

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,740
say trigger this based on Add to Cart

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:42,710
and the thing I like about ahoy is that

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:45,210
it has tons of WooCommerce specific

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,460
monitoring right are tons of WooCommerce

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,590
specific triggers that can be used and

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,030
so you go oh yeah when someone adds it

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,030
which is what logically makes sense

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,710
right you put something in the cart and

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,540
this thing goes oh let me check to see

00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,370
how many are in the cart oh it was the

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,320
first item in the cart great now I want

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,600
to start the messaging to say you put

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,380
one in if you put a second your third is

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,420
free right so I can say yeah I want you

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,430
to trigger it based on adding to cart

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,470
then I can go into the call-to-action

00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,000
and remember I said it could be a button

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,460
it could be a link it could just be a

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,020
notification right so we get that option

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,790
and then right we can define what are

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,970
the other conditions in the car now see

00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:29,190
here you'll see is cart item count more

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,410
than zero less than three so I want this

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,050
to pop up when the count in the car is

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:37,080
at a certain range right but that is

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:39,060
cart item count is only one of all the

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,340
options right I can look at cart totals

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,990
how much the customer is spent what

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,780
items the customer is purchased it just

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,150
goes on I mean that that drop-down list

00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,700
has 20 30 items in it that you can

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,220
scroll through right so all of that

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,580
helps me trigger that is a product

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,560
called ahoy it's at a URL called use

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,080
ahoy right so it's not you can't just

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,430
type oh ho a calm and the beautiful

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,930
thing is there is a discount going on

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:11,400
right now if you use a

00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:14,250
you'll get a 20% off right so now we say

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,040
okay we view the product we added it to

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,200
cart we auto added a coupon and then

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,470
they go to checkout right and you go

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,200
okay by using the right coupons by using

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,500
the right approach to coupons we are

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,840
driving the value up but that is only

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,490
one of the three strategies we're

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,860
talking about today right

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,960
it's coupons it's order bumps its

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,330
one-time offers right so all we've done

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,690
is talked about how to do coupons the

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:45,570
right way that's it right so then we say

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:48,120
well what is an order bump right how do

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,580
we think about an order bump well we

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,950
have all experienced order bumps all the

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:59,010
time how many of you have ever gone to a

00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:02,430
grocery store I'm trying to figure out

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:04,920
how the rest of you eat is it seriously

00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:07,290
all ubereats you're just like oh just

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,730
bring me more food to my house right so

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:14,100
if you go to the checkout stand it looks

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:17,160
like this right and this is all every

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,660
one of these things even if you don't

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:24,480
believe me all these items are

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,580
non-essential items not one of these

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,200
things is a oh I went to the supermarket

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,490
to buy this this is all extra right

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,900
nobody is like I need to get another

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,730
magazine I'm taking me to the

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,960
supermarket no one's like hey I need to

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,530
get more candy take me in a supermarket

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,500
right no no no no I'm just not believing

00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:46,020
it you go to the grocery store to buy

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,340
other food and then you get to the

00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,620
checkout stand and what happens when you

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,680
get to the checkout stand

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,510
you're presented with order bombs you're

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,950
presented with oh by the way I know you

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,160
probably weren't thinking about it but

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,960
do you also want a candy bar right oh by

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,180
the way while you're standing in line do

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,710
you also want this magazine oh by the

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:08,070
way while you're here do you want to buy

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:12,060
a DVD you're like no I know I'm good

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,140
right but I want you to do this the next

00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,270
time you're at the grocery store and

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,620
you're standing in line I want you to

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,860
watch the people in front of you in

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,940
Bihar

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:25,860
you and see how many people actually

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,110
grab something or worse or those of us

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,820
that are parents

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,890
how many have our children grab things

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,929
and you have to decide if that's the

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,270
fight you want to fight right then and

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,040
most the time we're like enough forget

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,750
it just here just put it on the right

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,860
because we're like no it's just too much

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:45,390
hassle to have that fight

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,640
these are order bumps there are things

00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,710
that you don't necessarily need you

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,500
didn't start by saying I need to go by

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,820
this but yeah they make sense they're

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,830
cool that's a good idea okay

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,010
I'll throw it in its they don't even

00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,970
know one sells this to you right when

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,440
you're at the cashier the cashier

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,330
doesn't say oh by the way do you want a

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,720
candy bar behind you they don't have to

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:08,780
say a word they're just there right so

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,760
imagine if I was going to my store and

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:16,020
I'd already put three word camp t-shirts

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,809
in OC 2015 16 and 17 like cool on this

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,030
sample suit on this sample site the 18

00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:23,610
shirt right the one with the dragon it

00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,140
wasn't even there it's not only oh but

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,890
wait a second right

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:31,620
I have an order bomb it says yes I want

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:34,470
the limited edition 2018 t-shirt it says

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,390
yeah oh my gosh it's only $2.99 check

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:39,840
this out I got to do it and you go it's

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,220
right there in my cart I mean it's not

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,610
even the cart it's a check out right

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:48,809
it's right there at checkout and it's

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:51,809
very inexpensive compared to the rest so

00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:53,910
you say yeah you know what I mean I'm

00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:56,460
I'm looking at a cart full of stuff I

00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:59,640
have the different t-shirts of course

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,429
yeah four okay just all I'm doing is

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,860
checking the box

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:08,580
that's an order bump that's a I didn't

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:11,070
necessarily need it but sure I was

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,540
having I was I was smoking cigars and

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,000
hanging out having drinks my friend

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,830
Robbie from beaver builder and just last

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,260
night and we were we were chatting about

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,580
order bumps and I said well of course

00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,720
you could do an order bump right but

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,760
beaver Billy er someone's buying the

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,190
product and then you could sell them a

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,380
PDF right here's a 10 page document or

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,900
20 page document on the most common

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,350
mistake

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:34,600
or the best tricks for getting started

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:39,100
or going faster write a PDF if I'm

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:42,580
spending $99 or $199 and I have a $5 PDF

00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,080
who doesn't check that box you think if

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,500
there's a chance something in this is

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,830
valuable for $5 yeah yeah just check the

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,830
box and all of a sudden you're like wow

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,290
we're making more money per transaction

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,310
now I'm not saying create a worthless

00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:02,370
PDF I'm saying you need to create value

00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:04,540
but when the value dynamic is

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,330
inexpensive in comparison to what people

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:13,540
are buying this decision is an on

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:16,000
decision that makes sense okay so how do

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:19,600
we do it well we use a product card cart

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,410
flows and cart flows allows you to go in

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,050
and define order bumps right cart flows

00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:29,410
is the product that everybody who's ever

00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:31,450
used WooCommerce wanted without knowing

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:34,180
the exact name of it and not knowing how

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,620
to explain it and so every designer and

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,210
every developer and every agency they

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,380
worked with would say well here let me

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,700
show you how to use clickfunnels

00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,600
and then we'll do click funnels and then

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,010
we'll bring them over to your cart

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,560
because all the funnel work they were

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:47,140
doing was somewhere else and cart flow

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,250
said well you know we can we can

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,980
probably do the funnels right here in

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,960
lieu commerce and that's what they did

00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,570
and one of the features they created is

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,070
this order bump feature and you can go

00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,170
in and define which products going to

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,160
show up and you can define the images

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,150
you're gonna find the title you can

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,190
define the price you're gonna find

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,780
everything for that little box you can

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,820
style it too right you don't have to be

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,820
a programmer to go in and say change

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:13,780
these colors and do this stuff right you

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:16,630
can define order bumps very easily okay

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:19,660
here's the trick though if you're gonna

00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:23,950
create an order bump the general rule of

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:26,950
thumb is keep it under 20% if you can

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,020
pull it off keep it under 10% but 20%

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,300
statistically seems to be the place

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,790
where research from Mauna Tait research

00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:37,390
from a couple of other places tells us

00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:39,910
hey the non-decision becomes a decision

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,550
when it gets too expensive now how many

00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:47,470
of you have one of the newer eye

00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:50,290
phones right so some of you spent a lot

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,320
of money right a thousand dollars on a

00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:56,170
phone do you know why you all bought

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,120
cases some of you're saying because I

00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:59,350
want to protect my phone no not when

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,640
you're buying the new phone every year

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,830
so don't act like it's all about

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,070
protection no why because the case was

00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:08,260
super cheap in comparison to a thousand

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,300
dollar phone a twenty dollar case or a

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:14,680
ten dollar case is essentially a free

00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:16,030
item it's a no brainer right you just

00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,450
say oh yeah sure I should probably the

00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,890
case right and that's why if you go into

00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,870
the AT&T store if you go into the

00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,280
Verizon store if you go into the Apple

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:28,270
Store they're happy to sell you

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:31,150
accessories right because it's a very

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:35,050
small price in comparison to the price

00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:38,350
anchor that is the main product order

00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:41,020
bumps are non decisions that people can

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,300
quickly and easily decide on by clicking

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,250
the checkbox if you define the right

00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,770
product in the right price that make

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:53,580
sense

00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:57,190
awesome okay so the last one right is

00:27:53,580 --> 00:28:00,240
the one time offers this is where cart

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:04,110
flows really shines right because

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,450
upsells work best after the transaction

00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,890
what are upsells right those accessories

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,990
I was talking about those are upsells

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,360
right if you were buying an Apple

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,740
computer you bought a MacBook and the

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,720
MacBook you go in and you start the

00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,940
process and then it says hey do you want

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,050
to upgrade your RAM that's an upsell hey

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,180
do you want to upgrade your did your

00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,740
drive you the hard drive space that's an

00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,600
upsell right and we're clicking these

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,790
little things and again compared to the

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,650
big price of the computer these little

00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:33,130
upgrades for $100 here and $200 they're

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:36,130
not a big deal right so those are

00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:40,150
upsells upsells before you put the

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:42,100
product in your cart can work upsells

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,630
when you're in the cart and you'll see

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,280
that if you go to Amazon you put

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,050
something in your cart and then Amazon

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,240
shows you several people have also

00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,830
purchased this or you're buying one item

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,870
of what should be a three item purchase

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,520
this is a bundle you bought a camera

00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,039
aren't you gonna need batteries don't

00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,919
you want another lens don't

00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:02,580
on a tripod by the full package right up

00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:06,269
cells in your checkout also work but the

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:09,269
best ones are after you've made the

00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:11,639
interaction because you've already put

00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:13,710
in your card you've already filled it in

00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:16,499
you've already moved on honestly you

00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,259
think you're done right so what happens

00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:22,559
is you come into something like this and

00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:26,549
in cart flows you can say hey I want to

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:30,299
add after the checkout I want to add an

00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:33,840
upsell okay and before the thank you I

00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:36,299
want to add this upsell and you go okay

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,039
so what's that going to do I'm gonna put

00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,629
all my information into the cart

00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,099
remember we saw we had three items in

00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:44,729
the cart there was a checkbox for the

00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:46,440
for the upsell we or the the order Bob

00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:49,529
we checked the box for the order Bob we

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,470
hit complete order and after we complete

00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:55,019
order it takes us to another page right

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,460
and instead of that page having the

00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:58,559
thank you here's your order information

00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,950
that's what thank you page right it

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,679
inserts another step in the flow in this

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:07,619
particular case it shows you the 2019

00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,059
t-shirt and it gives you the yes or no

00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:10,859
now of course you would normally put a

00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,619
lot more text behind it this was custom

00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:15,989
design did Robert design this by the way

00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:18,179
yes okay so you'd say let me tell you it

00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:19,409
about Robert how amazing he is that you

00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,909
know this is all something by the way we

00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:21,989
had a limited run on these shirts and

00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:24,690
you're never gonna see it again right

00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:26,099
this by the way this can be priced

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,129
differently but you're gonna give people

00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:33,960
a yes link and a no link a yes option

00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:37,289
under no option no credit card fields no

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:42,570
address no shipping just a yes click and

00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:45,539
a no click and what happens some of you

00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,710
click yes then you'll get to the thank

00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,109
you page and the Thank You page will

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,840
show that you paid for this too right

00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:54,889
but you did not process this the same

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,700
way you did not evaluate it the same way

00:30:54,889 --> 00:31:02,070
some of you put things in your cart and

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,419
then you wait and you go back and look

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,659
at the cart and you're making that

00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:10,020
decision is this cheap enough that I

00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:13,440
don't have to explain this to my spouse

00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,390
and if it is maybe you push the button

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,740
and if it's not then you start talking

00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,000
to your spouse about how you know how

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,320
I've always wanted those new pair of

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,330
shoes right you start having the

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,700
conversation so you can go back and hit

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,130
submit but there's a whole process none

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,570
of that applies to the one-time offer

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,460
because the one-time offer is different

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,510
the one-time offers after you've

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,590
finished everything that's after you've

00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,630
filled out the form it's after you hit

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,460
checkout it's happy hit complete you're

00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,620
all done and it says oh by the way hey

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,720
just for you just this one time just

00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,880
maybe if you want I just want to show

00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,690
you this one other thing you can all you

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,240
have to do is click yes or no how many

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,830
of you have ever gone to your spouse or

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,200

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,460

like yeah but I got this great deal

00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:17,690

great deals what happens people go yes

00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:23,309

for the product but in reality right if

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,750
we go back for a second you'll see that

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,520
at the bottom of this thing you have

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:40,920
this whole edit edit the flow by adding

00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,720
another step you don't have to be

00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:50,670
limited to just one step right you could

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,460
say hey do you want this t-shirt special

00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:55,800
edition but it's you know heads up you

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,210
know it's $19 right when all the other

00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,070
dollars were ten all the other teachers

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,600
were ten this is $19 it's a special

00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:03,450
edition you only get one shot at this

00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,910
right and they say yes you go do you

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,590
want the golf edition hat that went with

00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,250

yes right you can keep going or you can

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,000
be like my friend Steve who would be

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:19,110
like no no I can't spend money so what

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,669
happens right you hit no but just

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,909
because you hit no doesn't mean the

00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:24,889
game's over cuz you can

00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:27,289
create another offer on the no flow

00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:29,690
right when someone hits no you go here's

00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:31,309
another step hey totally get it you

00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,289
don't want the 19 shirt because it's

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:39,590
expensive except you know we created a 9

00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:42,259
mm 19 beanie right it's a red beanie

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,970
it's really awesome and we only have 50

00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:48,619
left but if you want it like do you want

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:50,989
that right it's another option and

00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:53,059
people go oh yeah okay but that's only

00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:54,289
ten bucks the 99 I don't want to swing

00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:56,419
the t-shirt but the template and they

00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:59,389
hit YES on that and you want to get

00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:00,979
crazy you could ask them well hey now

00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:02,330
that you got the beanie right I got to

00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:03,559
show you the wristbands to go with it

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,320
you're like oh my god we can play this

00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:08,149
game all day long right now there is a

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,750
limit to doing this and so you want to

00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:13,399
manage that but the point is cart flows

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,829
allows you to create all the steps in

00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:22,359
the world any steps any amount of steps

00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:26,240
you want okay this is cart flows and

00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,200
there is a free edition that doesn't

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,510
even cost you money that you can play

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,159
with of course I would recommend that

00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,559
you get the Pro Edition because you can

00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,960
do so much more but there is a free one

00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,099
so you just play with it try it out

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,020
every single person that I have given

00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:41,270
this to every single store that I have

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:44,510
helped put this in place has made more

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,889
money but the reality is it's not about

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,879
the tools and technologies right it's

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:48,649
about the thinking behind it

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,819
understanding what's the right offers at

00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:54,139
the right times and putting that in

00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:56,240
front of people so we've talked about or

00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,430
coupons we've talked about order bumps

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:03,319
we've talked about one-time offers they

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:05,859
are all tools to drive your revenue it's

00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:09,500
money you're leaving on the table and

00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:11,420
notice that none of this was stuff that

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,430
I said okay here's all the code you have

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,380
to put in your site here's all the stuff

00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,900
you have to type out here the developers

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:21,049
you're gonna have to hire any store

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,349
owner any store builder can put this

00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:27,140
apply it test it out and start making

00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:28,579
more money my name is Chris i'ma I do

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,440
work at like a web you can find me on

00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:32,440
twitter at kasama thank you very much

00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:46,859
nice job thank you sir we got five

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:47,369
minutes for questions hey Chris thank

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,319
you for that

00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:52,440
yeah put question regarding I think

00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:55,349
those card flows it's interesting that

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,779
what you can do with the I guess the

00:35:55,349 --> 00:36:00,450
post check out the yes no yes there a

00:35:57,779 --> 00:36:02,279
way to test it within card flows so you

00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,210
know where you can really maximize it

00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:04,890
cuz you're gonna get to a point where

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,779
you century and probably piss off your

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,400
customers so is there a way to kind of

00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:11,579
track to see if this is the best route

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,869
to take yeah so the question is hey if

00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,599
you're using something like cart flows

00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:17,539
and you're putting a lot of steps into

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,309
the flow is there a way for you to

00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:20,730
evaluate you know like how well it's

00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:23,519
working

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,710
so Karpos has its own ability to tell

00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,049
you what's working but you also have the

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,730
ability to use google analytics right

00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:31,799
cuz you're still doing this on pages

00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,599
you're still able to define events

00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:34,950
you're still able to do all so if you

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,539
have a person who just plays in the

00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,400
statistics game and is evaluating this

00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:39,960
they can still do it you're not changing

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,329
anything to do that thanks for that

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:47,430
great question questions we have a

00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:49,259
couple over here first of all the Google

00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:53,069
is awesome a server for ten years

00:36:49,259 --> 00:36:56,250
they've thank you for that question

00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:58,799
would be the technical details of this

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:01,170
when does the credit card get charged

00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,970
does it get charged again is a good

00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,529
charge three times it just happened the

00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,509
end when's the authorization happened

00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:08,880
I'm just kind of curious right so the

00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:10,529
question is when exactly does the credit

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,769
card get charged how does it play out

00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:16,019
right from what we've seen the credit

00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:18,089
card is charged to full amount not the

00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:20,369
separate ones is that right yeah that's

00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:22,559
what I that's what we've seen so it it

00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:24,329
runs the full charge so if you had three

00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,220
t-shirts in you got one discounted off

00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:27,930
then you added the bump and then you

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,000
finished and went over and then you have

00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,440
the one-time offer and you Bob that when

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,990
you get to the Thank You page it'll say

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,329
you actually spent $48 and that was a

00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:39,569
transaction that happens in your card

00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:41,819
yeah right Chris thank you once again

00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:44,250
you were amazing my question is what is

00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:45,170
the number of times did you give them an

00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,630
extra bump

00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:50,700
so an order bump I would limit it to one

00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,950
bump but I would not limit it to one

00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,230
Universal bump I would define different

00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,670
bumps for different products so if I'm

00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,410
buying t-shirts that's one thing if I'm

00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,790
selling an online course as a different

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,890
one if I'm doing a membership that's a

00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,890
different one so think about your

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,540
products your your bump is a one you

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,910
don't want three bumps you want one bump

00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:11,030
that is like a no-brainer decision then

00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:14,310
your one-time offer you can do multiple

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:16,590
my favorite thing to do in the one time

00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,420
offer is a subscription or a recurring

00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,720
revenue model right so what I was

00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,280
talking to Robbie about yesterday was

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,980
sell beaver builder okay there's your

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,450
product have a order bump that is a PDF

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,190
that teaches you how to do something or

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,290
keeps you away and then in your one-time

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,690
offer sell a subscription where you get

00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,160
three new templates a month if you sign

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,840
up for this you know membership and

00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,400
every month you get billed and every

00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,990
month you get new stuff or you might do

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,030
a one-time payment for a year long thing

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,130
right so subscription and recurring

00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:46,260
revenue models are fantastic as one-time

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,300
offers because people say no but they're

00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,480
most excited in that moment to

00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,490
accelerate their their goal right and if

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,410
you can help someone accelerate to their

00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:59,220
destination they'll pay you money for

00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:01,200
that yeah so you showed at the beginning

00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,900
they're like a 10% discount for a

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,270
first-time shopper we're in that float

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,040
do you collect their email address where

00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,420
you can compare it and make sure that

00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,310
they are indeed a first-time shopper the

00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,040
same thing for abandoned carts like how

00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,510
are you getting a unique identifier so

00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,370
that you can do that follow-up where and

00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:19,530
it's four part it's part of the checkout

00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,630
so route commerce gives you that ability

00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,890
to define in the same way that if you've

00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,990
played with WooCommerce before and you

00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:27,570
know that when you go to make a payment

00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:30,180
the shipping options are predicated on

00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,800
what you put in the customer sign so

00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,450
it's it's that same dynamic you're

00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,450
putting customer information which

00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,470
includes email right and then location

00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,450
which is going to affect your shipping

00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:42,390
options the email is going to affect the

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:46,910
discount rules so you could outsmart it

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,910
by giving someone else's email but

00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,800
right no and this is this is a different

00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,640
design element different design approach

00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,490
yes we have another one a one-time offer

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,610
thing can you do multiple item on the

00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:07,820
page and have it pop-up based on the

00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:11,390
dollar value of what they're buying so

00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,520
the question is on a one-time offer can

00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:24,050
I trigger it based on or can I change

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:26,960
the rules based on what they're right

00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:31,370
I'm sorry if they buy three necklaces

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,040
can the necklace offer be pop-up or the

00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:37,670
earring be pop-up versus something else

00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,430
that just not alone to it yes so there's

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:43,340
multiple answers can you create multiple

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:46,670
discount rules that are all buy one get

00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,110
one free or versions of that Biagio for

00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,910
different products the answer is yes can

00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,470
you do it just on products sure but you

00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,670
can also do on product categories so

00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:54,500
anything in that category so if you're

00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,730
looking at necklaces you can create the

00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,310
rule for the necklace that's one part

00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,660
the pop-up which is can you pop up and

00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,960
tell them that this is their available

00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,880
whatever

00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,830
yes that's ahoy that's different but yes

00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,830
you can do that to one category or

00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:10,010
quantity or anything else one more so if

00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:13,250
I'm selling a product that has supplies

00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:15,920
with it and I want to do a yes/no with a

00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:19,280
subscription for the supplies and the

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,350
person pushes the button no could I then

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,600
would it make sense in your mind to then

00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:27,050
offer them maybe a three month or a

00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,510
smaller version of that yearly

00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,920
subscription of supplies so first of all

00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,210
if you're asking me to build that for

00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,620
each wave I could totally do it if you

00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:37,100
ask Steve I'm not sure he can pull it

00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:39,680
off but the second part the second part

00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:42,380
of that answer is absolutely and in fact

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,110
it wouldn't I wouldn't just offer a

00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,820
different length of the subscription I

00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,520
would offer a different kind of

00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:53,120
subscription so part of what happens is

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,730
you say hey you might anchor with 12

00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,170
months plus VIP treatment a special

00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,720
phone line that you can call in and get

00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:02,840
support but if that's too much and you

00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,920
say no what about six months no special

00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,710
line but this

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,150
and way less and people go oh given that

00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,160
you just anchored me on this high price

00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,690
this lower price makes a lot of sense

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,069
thank you that's super all right I think

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,420
we're done yeah I don't deserve this

00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:15,230
abuse but big round of applause for

00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,730
