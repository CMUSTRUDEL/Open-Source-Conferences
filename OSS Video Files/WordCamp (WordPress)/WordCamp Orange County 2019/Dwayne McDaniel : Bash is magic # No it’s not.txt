Duane McDaniel Duane first started using

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:17,520
Drupal and WordPress for the San

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,400
Francisco improv community in 2013 which

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,370
led him to his current role as a

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,080
developer advocate at Pantheon he has

00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:29,010
had the privilege of presenting at

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:33,200
dozens of community events from Paris to

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:39,059
Iceland and from MIT to Stanford

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:43,079
Dwayne McDaniel awesome intro thank you

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,879
very very much for that says I was just

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,699
introduced now I feel redundant I'm

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,109
Duane how are you gonna get the most out

00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:51,329
of this talk is you're gonna go to emcee

00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,620
Duane comm and find the slides of this

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,269
talk and just pull it up on your machine

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,280
if you're playing along at home that's

00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:57,390
awesome I'll talk more about how you're

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,030
gonna get more later but if you ever

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,979
want to talk about crocheting or web

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,949
comics or karaoke like the awesome party

00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,420
tonight we're gonna sing good I'm always

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,350
happy to talk about those things there's

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,990
how to get a hold of me

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,850
Twitter is my social media of choice I

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,860
think it's the best social media thing

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,210
ever made for events and I got a lot of

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,549
events and if you go to my website

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,810
you'll see that quick plug for the

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,110
company I work for that sends me here

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,420
this Pantheon homing who in the room is

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,450
familiar with Pantheon that's about half

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,340
the room we are a web site operations

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,780
platform a way to build and run your

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,600
websites no matter how big your team is

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,950
no matter how complex your workflow gets

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,630
we're there for you we post some of the

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,920
biggest most complex sites in the world

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,250
and probably work with you so quick pull

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,659
time actually actually if I get

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,649
everybody that's comfortable standing up

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,880
right now to just stand up real quick

00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:51,990
let's practice raising arms everybody

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,130
just raise their arms up as high as you

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,700
feel comfortable doing it if you don't

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,380
feel don't push it all right and now put

00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,549
your arms down and your left and right

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,170
and see if you know those people if you

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,619
don't introduce yourself real quick 30

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,619
seconds

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,129
hi man I'm going thanks thanks for

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,690
coming up all right I got to get back to

00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,489
the room but thank you very much

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,379
all right now we're like together in a

00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,790
room doing a thing together good job if

00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,069
you haven't met those people talk to him

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,769
later need plenty of time who saw this

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,769
on the schedule and said I want to go to

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:34,489
that talk that's half the room paying

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:36,769
attention who who in the room has a

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,549
computer again the same people don't

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,290
raise your hand I'm weren't paying

00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:42,230
attention I have a computer open in

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,610
front of them who here is a full-time

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,380
developer what they do is they consider

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,549
themselves a developer awesome you're

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,080
gonna get a lot out of this talk who

00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,269
here is a full-time designer and what

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,519
they do is design awesome raise your

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:54,470
hand probably all the developers look

00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,489
around see the designers because you

00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:00,049
really need their help really bad and

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,489
other way around true all the way around

00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,410
it's true so everybody needs everybody

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,299
in this room any project managers in

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,299
here yes

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:09,650
project managers rule is there any any

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,880
business people that just they're

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,849
business people that's what they do

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,850
awesome let's Gary here Rob yeah Jon

00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,709
back here is there any out of there

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:26,799
fields that I left out any other like

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:29,299
things of note jugglers anyone else okay

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,950
well I hope all you get out is there

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,049
anybody in here create content on the

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,160
regular

00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:36,019
ultimately I think this will help you at

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,560
the end of the day and that's gonna be a

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,630
while before we get there in this talk I

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,310
have a lot of slides and I'm not cutting

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,850
them down for this talk and not for you

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,829
guys if if you want to do this as a

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,230
tutorial as a go on your own pace

00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,160
workshop that's what I really built I'm

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,139
gonna go through highlights today I'm

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,910
going to read every slide to you if you

00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:57,739
don't know what bash is don't worry

00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,049
about it just take some notes just pay

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,319
attention and get some ideas if you're

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,880
using bash on the rig or casually just

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,230
here and there and you like copy paste

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,180
things and tabash and you're not really

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,590
sure what you're doing maybe open your

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,019
machine and play along when we get to

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,639
the tutorial parts and if you can

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,789
understand what that last line is just

00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,840
go do that and we'll get there later cuz

00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,349
there's something in this talk for

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,859
everyone

00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,419
I call this talk bash is magic no it's

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,180
not for a reason we get to the no it's

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,810
not part later

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,770
but Bash seems like magic it's this

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,930
amazing things let's talk about magic

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,610
for a second Matt's just exciting that's

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,400
kids birthday parties it's card tricks

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:39,810
it's Penn & Teller it's awesome fun

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,240
stuff but it's also potentially really

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,660
dangerous and confusing and black magic

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,009
and just feels weird and if you don't

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,600
know what you're doing with it

00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,009
this seems overwhelming and there's a

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,449
lot to read here and there's a lot to

00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:55,139
think about how would you even use this

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,639
card it's an awesome card by the way but

00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,750
I really want to demystify this when I

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,270
was talking to one of my business

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,560
colleagues and we was trying to break

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,840
this talk in the first place I got stuck

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,880
at a point and I was just bouncing ideas

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,320
off then and he's like you know that

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,270
sounds like kind of ballpoint open

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,320
sources isn't it like just try and smart

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,260
things together the other smart people

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,570
made like that's really brilliant inside

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,580
then so I've put him in my talk because

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,639
if we have all these open source tools

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,110
we can use and we can know what to do

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,060
with them they're not scary but anything

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,789
we don't know the unknown is always

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,560
terrifying especially when you hear of

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:32,130
stories like this which is even a true

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,650
story just got publicized that we can do

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,090
things that are just crazy powerful that

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,520
can wipe out entire racks of servers

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,800
with one bad command which is

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,930
technically possible but this is

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,970
actually a made-up story but ultimately

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:50,190
we're all afraid of touching one wrong

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,539
thing on our machine and doing this but

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,949
that real fear isn't that we're gonna

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,180
mess up a machine it's a machine who

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,580
cares like we're gonna need another

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,289
machine and move on but it took us so

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,870
long to get that machine set up the way

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,070
we wanted it it took us so long to

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,419
figure out all the ins and outs of all

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,370
the GUI screens for that operating

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,599
system sometimes it takes years to get a

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,150
machine to do exactly what you want it

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,000
to do and this fear is very very very

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,720
real but I'm here to tell you today

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,699
don't be afraid of it

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm not the person who's gonna tell you

00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,740
don't be afraid but there's a lot of

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,449
people in the universe that will tell

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,180
you don't be afraid of Bosch if you have

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,400
no idea what it is don't worry about it

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,990
we'll get there but it's not something

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,220
to be terrified of it is something

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,770
that's gonna unleash the power of your

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:33,900
machine in a way that you can't do today

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,690
my central premise is this why do you

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,010
want to do this

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,540
because we live in a world behind

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,890
graphical user interfaces and there's

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,200
nothing wrong with gooeys gooeys make

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,480
our lives easier that we don't have to

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,100
think about what to type to invoke a

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,020
command we can simply go click a button

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,210
and do a thing and that makes life great

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,180
on Chrome and if you're watching YouTube

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,100
and a lot of other things it's just easy

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,780
but what you're really living behind is

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,420
what a developer thought you should do

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,900
with your machine which is a very

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,010
limited scope because they as a

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,720
developer working on a project or a

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,730
designer want you to do this set of

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,960
actions in this order and the Guru

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,470
reflects that there's nothing wrong with

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,030
that but this is also slow going through

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,630
and setting up a wordpress website by

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,880
hand is slow especially if we do it a

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,440
lot if you find yourself doing the same

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,770
thing repeatedly over and over again

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,900
every day turns out there's a better way

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,390
to do that you can automate anything

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,580
that you can do repeatedly with the same

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,190
repeatable steps if you tell a machine

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,620
just to do those same steps that's

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,240
really hard to do with a GUI like things

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,860
like zapier and if-then then that makes

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,590
that a little easier on a certain scale

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,990
but you can extend that to literally

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,150
anything your machine can do but just

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,160
telling the machine what to do and if

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,630
you do development long enough or you're

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,580
in the space long enough eventually you

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,260
will run into a problem where someone

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,000
will say hey there's already a really

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,010
good tool that solves that once you just

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,360
go get it off github if you don't know

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,910
what github is and you don't know how to

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,590
use these command-line tools it's like

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,320
they're speaking in an alien language

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,000
from outer space and like I don't know

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,170
and you show up and like I don't know

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,360
what to do with any of this because it's

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:17,130
not documented well and ultimately we

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,800
know that we can tell machines to do

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,960
very complex things through this idea of

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,610
scripting that we can tell it to do a

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,830
bunch of order of things to do and it

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,170
can produce amazing results and if

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,520
you've never seen the asking Star Wars

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,860
we'll get to it at the very end where

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,450
you can watch it online or just go to

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,160
tile that blinking light net on telnet

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,599
that's why I want to talk about this is

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,810
why bash makes me excited is because we

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,690
can literally unlock our machines so

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,730
what we're talking about bash

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,690
that's the bourne-again shell why do we

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,129
call the born again shell because

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,589
there's a guy named Steven Bourne and

00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,970
he's worked at Bell Labs and they wrote

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,829
a thing called Unix

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,389
not the only version of UNIX that

00:08:54,829 --> 00:09:00,829
existed in the universe UNIX stands for

00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:02,569
something but Steven was solving the

00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:07,040
fundamental problem of how do we move

00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:10,250
around files inside of UNIX and evaluate

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,310
them to do things and about ten years

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,480
later nine years later Richard Stallman

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,009
said this should be open source so we're

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,259
gonna rewrite under the GNU project and

00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,339
Brian Fox who lives up in Santa Barbara

00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:21,800
I don't know he still lives there but

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:24,290
from Santa Barbara they rewrote shell

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,389
and in honor of Steven Bourne who wrote

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,589
the original they called it the born

00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:30,050
again shell so that's where bash comes

00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:31,220
from and if you go to Wikipedia it's

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,529
gonna give you this answer what bash

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,360
does which isn't wrong it's totally the

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,620
right answer but it's too long because

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,980
this is really how you should think

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:43,000
about bash tech commands do things

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,990
that's all bash really does is its core

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,540
for those of you who are brand-new to

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,920
bash it's intimidating partially because

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,480
you don't know how to use its emulator

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,430
the way that a telegraph machine is

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,610
intimidating the underlying technology

00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,930
isn't dangerous or scary like we're

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,149
gonna send an electrical message from

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,380
here to here now the other end it will

00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,689
cause of this action and they can write

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,250
down what happened like does anybody

00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,660
think that's not a crazy weird idea

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,630
right like we can just send a message

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,829
over a wire now the code to head do it

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,720
that's a little confusing Morse code

00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,769
it's confusing to learn but once you

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,439
learn it you can use it forever

00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:19,689
literally it's in the same code for

00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:23,560
years and years and years

00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:26,180
turns out Alexa works the exact same way

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,910
Alexa for all it's do does all its bells

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,079
and whistles if you go through the docs

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,589
eventually you get to a realization that

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,939
all the Box does is a really smart

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,380
algorithm for natural language

00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:37,939
processing that writes down a sext

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,519
message and puts metadata around it

00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,809
based on where that device is located so

00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,610
if I say hey Alexa where's the weather

00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:46,129
or what's the weather outside it's gonna

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,389
write down that message and metadata and

00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:49,430
centered across the wire to a service

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:50,689
now that's kind of very complicated you

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,160
talk about lambda stack and things like

00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:54,980
that serverless

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,230
but what the actual box gets back is a

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,490
text message with metadata around it and

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,610
it reads the text

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,540
to you and tells you the weather and

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,990
then you can do other things based on

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,570
that metadata but that's all Alexa does

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:14,350
it sends messages from point A to point

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:16,399
B and these little files and folders

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,380
because that's at the end of the day

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,260
what your computer really is is a giant

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,360
pile of filters and files they get

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,910
executed that's it

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,709
again not a terrifying concept everybody

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,360
that has a machine in front of them who

00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:32,390
is not familiar with the concept of a

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,830
file or a folder we all are because it's

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,589
fundamental to the way the machine works

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,330
all bash does is give you a much quicker

00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,709
cleaner way to manipulate those things

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:45,320
around you can programmatically talk to

00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:47,180
and then about 1992-93 there was a guy

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,959
named - torval who was working with a

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:55,730
project maybe proto called Linux Linux

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,160
became the default operating system for

00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,459
all the beige boxes beige boxes in the

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,170
world

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:03,110
so boxes that are off somewhere else

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,880
running something else even windows got

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,110
on board with this recently and said hey

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,670
if you're using windows development

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,230
version you can just go ahead and run

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,690
Linux cuz come on that's what real

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,060
developers use let's just put it there

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,520
for you put whatever flavor you want

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,920
it's all the same thing to get you you

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,430
can see the tux up there by a Windows

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,570
terminal that's actually running Linux

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,770
it's ubiquitous it's everywhere every

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,660
machine you probably ever touched it

00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,190
probably has bash already in it because

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,820
Linux is probably already there

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,709
somewhere and Linus Torvalds Stallman's

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,790
project and said this is the shell

00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:38,959
operating system we want for Linux bash

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,339
became ubiquitous that's what I'm

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,020
teaching bash instead of the many other

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,970
shells that got written so I'm not gonna

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,339
talk about Z shell c shell care shell

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,140
and the zillion other shells you could

00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:49,910
run that I'll do the same basic thing

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,410
I'll talk about bash because it's

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,750
ubiquitous that is ubiquitous it's how

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,950
more complex things are being built

00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,930
because they're built out of this

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,240
concept of Linux and these idea of the

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,649
filesystem so who here is familiar with

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,949
any of the stuff over there on the right

00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:09,279
the circle CI Jenkins circle CI r CI CD

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:12,000
all right not many people in the room

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,240
Peter build tools these are

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,270
services that perform actions that build

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,260
automate testing the more complex your

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,820
project the more you're going to run

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,490
into this stuff so if you want to every

00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,350
change you make on your code go ahead

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,030
and run this series of tests on it and

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,530
then deploy the artifact that got built

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:33,420
out of it being assembled to a target

00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,690
those are the tools that will let you do

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,390
it

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,370
but essentially in their core it's just

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,880
a machine you don't own that executes a

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:45,060
bash script rewrote so that world is

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,820
really sealed off if you don't

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,530
understand bash the good news is bash is

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,780
really straightforward to learn and

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,420
that's what were to spend the rest of

00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,740
today talking about at the end we'll get

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,280
a little more in tips and tricks of it

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,840
and some advanced stuff and then we'll

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,660
open it up for what your favorite bash

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,130
stuff is and what I'm I've forgotten

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,460
because I am learning this as I go as

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,320
well

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,540
we all are we're not Richard Stallman

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:16,680
you probably don't know all the bash

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:18,540
keep shortcut keys so if you're on a Mac

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,770
or Linux box guess what you already have

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,990
this you don't have to do anything just

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,210
open up eternal you're automatically in

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,480
it that's it if you're on a Windows 10

00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:29,040
box professional edition dead jump into

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,260
one except system if you have another

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,690
Windows box just download get it gives

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,070
you a really clean simple minimize

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,330
version of bash that you can do pretty

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,920
much everything I'm gonna show today

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:44,010
with so the rest of this talk is well

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,600
these four areas gaining the complexity

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,960
of what it can do for some examples

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,210
around it that's it so again if you're a

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,620
casual user open up a terminal play

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,850
along maybe want some stuff who here

00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,400
thinks this is like an intimidating

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,660
round of information on a screen you can

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,800
raise your hand it's fine this is an

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,870
intimidating amount of information on

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,170
the screen absolutely there's a handful

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,970
of hands went up for those that go on if

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,860
you know how to read this though this is

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,960
all the information I wanted when I

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,690
looked in this folder all at one place

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,839
at one time and gives me like a really

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,250
good view as a developer what I'm doing

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,120
let's talk about what's there because

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,900
again this is a tutorial how this works

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,370
before that dollar sign

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,290
there's something looks like this on a

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,020
Mac it defaults to this computer name

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,430
your current directory your username and

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:38,529
then a dollar sign to tell you that's

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:40,720
the prompt that little tilde it's

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:43,570
actually kind of important that tilde on

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,270
a Mac in most UNIX boxes Linux boxes

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:50,080
will mean your home directory so if you

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,339
just say where is home tilde so you'll

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,750
see that in a lot of scripts it's like

00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:54,700
you'll have a tilde there instead of

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,920
like dollar store a dollar sign home

00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:00,040
means the same thing

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,410
equivalents but after the dollar signs

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,360
where we typed the things so this start

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,220
very simply what I did is I went through

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,240
all the manuals for all these commands

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,670
and we'll get two manuals later

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,980
and I said what does the manual actually

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,210
say this does and then I said well if I

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,460
was going to turn this into a lexical

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,339
and how would I describe this episode

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,560
saying Alexa I say hey bash so that's

00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,760
what literally I did the whole rest of

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,640
these slides and them an example below

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,060
of it actually running so present

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,810
working directory we can stepping back

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,209
just a little bit

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:34,540
the problem that Bourne was trying to

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:38,860
solve is how do we move around and

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:41,470
manipulate the files inside of Unix it's

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,950
all location-based so from bashes point

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:47,380
of view PWD means where am I looking

00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,270
where is the current place that I am

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,370
trying to manipulate space what are the

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,860
what I'm what folder am I literally in

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,140
so a working directory is also a working

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,089
folder interchangeable but PWD is the

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:03,790
command that tells me hey I'm in this

00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:06,280
long name of holder LS I can say hey

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,350
what's the directory in this list of the

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,900
contents of this directory

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,929
Sam is opening in a folder and seeing

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,110
all the files in there except you can

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:19,390
make it present a lot of additional

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:23,170
information show all your hidden folders

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,189
one flag and I realized right now it's

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,559
like hey wait a minute what's a flag

00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,520
what's a fact this is always the point

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,150
where someone starts getting nervous

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,370
because yes there's a lot a lot a lot of

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,780
flags I used to see a zillion that's not

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,000
true there's sometimes it's five

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,750
sometimes 40 but it's it's it's a

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,390
limited number and the nice thing

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,830
is the batch is open-source and I didn't

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,909
really dwell on that earlier with Stahl

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,990
I'm gonna talk about Stallman and Brian

00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:52,500
Fox but this is important it was written

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,970
by people like you and me who believe in

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,039
the open-source concept that we should

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,020
build tools and share them and share our

00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,159
knowledge the entire reason we're word

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,960
camp the reason you're in this room

00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,970
listening to me talk is to share

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,669
information and knowledge and to get on

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,789
the same page about all this so I lost -

00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:10,500
a gives you a view of everything and you

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:12,780
let you see your dot your dot dot and

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,010
any dot folders dot folder is a hidden

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,630
folder like my git folder in this

00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,890
directory I don't really need to see it

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,090
all the time it's there it's important

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,740
but I don't need to see it all the time

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:25,770
- dot means I'm here it's a recursive

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:28,200
concept of here and dot dot means one

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,580
level up appreciate forward wants you to

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,960
get your head around it and you're like

00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,130
wow that's a lot of information really

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,480
fast and you're right it is I don't have

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,650
that much time today folks that's why

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,270
these slides are available online you

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,169
can play along at home as you need to

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:41,970
and for every command that exists

00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,900
there's a manual for it already included

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,909
it works on an airplane

00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,830
we're completely offline if you're

00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:48,990
really bored and you have no internet

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,510
connection this will still work and it's

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,429
really powerful information just say man

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,980
and then whatever command even manual

00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:59,730
itself has a manual to tell you how to

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:03,720
use it properly man LS man PWD all of

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,460
them will forget to a manual they're fun

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,750
to read again because they're written

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,580
like people by people like you and me

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,350
all the jokes I put in here there are

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,049
jokes interwoven through the manuals I'm

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,840
not kidding like very smart logic like

00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:18,659
our smart with witticisms throughout it

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,100
all right so we told see where we are we

00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:23,250
see what's in the directory then we can

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,710
change directory and move around move to

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,510
other directories it's best a specific

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,490
directory we give it a full path and say

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,960
move all the way over here move all the

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,669
way back I'm gonna jump around pretty

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,789
straightforward move one level up that's

00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:37,919
what the dot dot means we can make

00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:40,440
directories making new ones very easy

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,049
make adder make directory very

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,250
straightforward make the drug new new

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,980
folder and put it exactly where I say

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,419
you can specify this to be very deep in

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,480
level or just some of the different

00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,559
computers somewhere else - is powerful

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,200
enough as long as the path that's

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,940
clear to do whatever you want I'm gonna

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,600
speed up just a little bit on this part

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,519
Oh what happened there I don't know copy

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,360
let's make a copy of this thing and put

00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:08,639
it somewhere else pretty powerful yeah

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,879
weird lag going on I don't know

00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:13,350
move move this where I say it move it is

00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,779
this is actually a really powerful

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,210
command because it's not just move from

00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,340
point A to point B it can be moved from

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,769
point A to point A and rename it along

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,619
the path so if you need to rename a

00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:27,389
bunch of things really fast move

00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:29,549
actually lets you do that extremely fast

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:32,940
without having to invoke some weird GUI

00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:34,019
tool remove oh now that actually we're

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,869
starting to get the world where it might

00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,940
be a little dangerous if you remove the

00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,710
wrong thing bad things happen but good

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,789
thing is that our M is actually pretty

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,230
benign on its own you're gonna remove

00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:45,269
individual files but you can't revoke

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,029
entire folders to do that you're gonna

00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,019
start invoking flags I can't I got this

00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,580
weird lag

00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:52,460
our minds are probably the most

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,659
dangerous command in the universe

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,460
because what it says is recursive

00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:59,129
everything I can see and everything

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,740
below this that's what we're gonna

00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:04,110
affect an F means force that's why it's

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,299
shouting because it's not giving you an

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,710
option if you do this it is gone it has

00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,110
gone forever and you will never get it

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,749
back until you like did a time machine

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,070
back up or you pull it down I but this

00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,779
is also super powerful that if you

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,309
completely blow up all the work you've

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,159
been doing today and you just like I've

00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,809
got to start over from scratch today

00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,700
jump up a folder are - are off that

00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:24,779
folder reclone it down from git and

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,850
you're right back to where you left off

00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:29,309
or where you left off last time you

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:32,970
saved and uploaded to get are committed

00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:34,740
to get history how are out my first

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,480
scripts really like practical scripts

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,220
where I looked at my history bashed cos

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,389
keeps track you just if you're in firm

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,590
terminal just go into terminal type

00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:43,409
histories you've everything you've ever

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,419
typed it all just be there those are fun

00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:46,499
functions for flipping coins that I was

00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,179
just experimenting with what's the most

00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:49,830
efficient way to do it turns out the

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,019
random echo is the shortest way I could

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,909
figure out how to do it clearing the

00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,490
screen I use this constantly in fact so

00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:57,539
much that aliased it and that actually

00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,399
leads me to my next section

00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,379
there's clears very simple is just let's

00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:04,870
get rid of everything off the screen oh

00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:08,080
and open

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:10,690
when you double mouse click a thing to

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,429
open a thing on an icon what you're

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,620
actually telling the computer to do is

00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:17,889
interpret this mouse click on a

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:21,269
graphical interface to go run open

00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:23,379
against the location of this application

00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:27,490
you're literally using the command line

00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:29,289
a level abstracted this is actually

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,899
really important because how do you open

00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:33,549
Firefox most probably search Firefox how

00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:36,669
do you open Chrome

00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:41,559
I mean maybe go click on the icon how do

00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:43,509
you open composer you don't you invoke

00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,850
it through the tool open lets you get to

00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,470
anything that has a GUI and open things

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,970
that you're used to opening this

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,340
actually becomes really really cool

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,679
about we can tie together things you can

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,210
and can't see when we get to that later

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,690
in scripting I'm gonna speed up just a

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:01,809
little bit more so that's the basic

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,509
stuff the very very basic stuff there's

00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:06,249
applications and tools because your

00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,389
computer can do a lot of things maybe

00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:10,419
more things than your think it's capable

00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:12,490
of now remember that we have at our

00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:14,019
fingertips more processing power than we

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:18,100
had on earth for all of the Apollo

00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:21,639
missions combined at your fingertips if

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,649
you have like a 2015 machine you have

00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:27,129
more RAM than existed on the planet

00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:28,929
Earth before like 1980 and we all hide

00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:30,669
it behind gooeys and we have these crazy

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,789
powerful tools that have been existence

00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:36,009
for 40 years think about how good iOS

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,379
has become since it was launched like

00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,659
how much better it got that's just like

00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:42,610
a decade imagine 40 years with these

00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:46,779
low-level tools that a lot of people

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:50,379
hack on so there's crap general regular

00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:52,330
expression search grep is the most

00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:54,100
powerful search pattern matcher that's

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,240
probably ever been made if you know what

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,389
you doing with regular expressions you

00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,519
can build crazy powerful tools that can

00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:03,129
find things and scent aeneas lee the

00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:05,350
actual way I use it for real is I keep

00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:08,139
all of my notes for all the events I go

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,759
to and text files on my machine and I

00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:11,679
can jump into that folder and grep any

00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,330
keyword if I do remember a partial

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,710
phrase from someone's talk I can

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,940
immediately find it it takes me less

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,110
time than it takes to open a web browser

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:23,030
to find something

00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:24,460
of a talk I went to last year curl pull

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,560
this all the way across the internet

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,040
that's what it means again it has a lot

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,390
of flags a lot of options you can do

00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,840
with it one of them that's super

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:38,690
powerful is curl - capital i' which

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,160
inspects the header who here likes in my

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,040
here regularly check and see if their

00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,750
front-end cache is working awesome this

00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,280
is a faster way to do that for those of

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,720
you don't open up a terminal and just

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,120
run this this will just run on almost

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,350
every machine on earth I guess any

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,330
website you want it will tell you

00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:56,090
literally the header information what

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,680
computers are reading and it will tell

00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,540
you an age of a cache if cache exists

00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,640
that's the way I primarily touch it

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:07,100
eventually you will run into the need to

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,990
actually modify a file enter VI one of

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,240
those powerful tools ever invented by

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,500
mankind and I see you now shaking your

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,510
head I used to be in that same boat

00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:20,300
because how you actually quit them as

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:23,060
this this is true it's not it's the anti

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,770
user-friendly text editor but it's the

00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,050
most powerful text editor I've ever used

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,150
once you get the hang of it being able

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,360
to just /type anything and jump to that

00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,980
line or copy like 50 lines at once or in

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,680
a visual mode it's like yank things

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,370
around and just it's super powerful and

00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,210
you can actually play this fun game I

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,990
have it open I don't have it open

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,150
anymore

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,560
you please super powerful are fun game

00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,300
called them adventure that will teach

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,280
you them through like a Legend of Zelda

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,110
type adventure and once you learn it

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,330
it's like wow I will never go like I've

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,640
quit using sublime text in favor of them

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,770
this is a true story but if you're like

00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,180
I don't want a billion hotkeys there's

00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,260
Nano and if you just need to manipulate

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,510
a file really quick while you're gonna

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,400
folder just on nano nanos another editor

00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,110
that's literally why I get the name but

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,400
it's just bit you BIC witness like I

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,510
used Pico here Pico is a clone of nano

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,040
Pico doesn't work nano well a nano

00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,010
doesn't work Pico will it depends on the

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,570
flavor of whoever put that box together

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:20,090
and there's a lot more tools you can

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,560
install in fact there are thousands

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,880
maybe millions of tools you can install

00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,740
they do a lot of cool things if you're

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,660
on Mac or Linux you can use brew or if

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,770
you're online excuse app get on Windows

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,630
I don't know what you'll do but you'll

00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,230
probably get Linux at some point and

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,120
then

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,549
you just use apt-get or homebrew works

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,900
and a lot of times I go to it's very

00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:37,190
technical talks they'll talk about a

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,480
tool and the very first thing I try

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,740
without like going to look at the

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,030
webpage or anything I'll just go in and

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,750
say brew install in the name of the

00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,160
thing and that's how I download software

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,960
that's it and it already installs it

00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,100
sets it up makes it ready to go and I

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,350
can just then type the name of that

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,000
command and just start working on it

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,230
there's a Legend of Zelda game you can

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,850
do with this with it actually there's

00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,179
two one's really really fun the other is

00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,179
really hard

00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:08,240
DX next e are S&S DX that's the X was

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:10,760
the joke one calc I use my computer to

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,770
calculate things I think we all do but I

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,100
really hate the layout of calculator I

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:18,590
just hate it it's like you kind of put

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,660
this button no I just want to type a

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,250
really long equation and have it spit

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,020
out an answer and that's calc it's not

00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,730
kind of pre-installed but again brew

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,640
install calc you're done and it's just

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,929
worse than from now get get dud probably

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,280
in comes your machine but get is the

00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:32,710
most powerful version control human

00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,940
beings have ever figured out it's

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,340
essential to do development in the

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,440
modern world it's essential to share

00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,059
your code in open source and this is the

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,799
easiest way we figured out how to do it

00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,059
if you the manual for actually calls it

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,280
the stupid content tracker that's not

00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:49,970
any way shape or form of commentary on

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,860
oh it's not my commentary and you can

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,169
see exactly what has gone on and a

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,490
project but again there's go easy on top

00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:56,929
of this but what the GUI does it just

00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,110
run these commands if you learn the

00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,490
commands you don't need the GUI anymore

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,429
there's awesome cools like links a

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,809
browser DuckDuckGo which is the this is

00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,730
their command line tool you want to

00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,250
start look up the manual for something

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:14,210
and not leave the terminal it's all DDR

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:16,880
DDG our door with command line and

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,000
there's thousands more rushed for Drupal

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,410
WP CLI for WordPress and pretty much

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,059
everything I pointed to here composer

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,559
and the dependency management think will

00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:26,090
tie things together be hat for

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,710
behavioral testing and backstop for

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:31,040
visual regression testing to see if

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,419
pixels are the same pixel to pixel much

00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,820
better than human being could possibly

00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:37,100
do it this found a problem when I

00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,679
updated PHP seven three recently that

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,150
I've is oblique ouldn't detect but it

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,980
said hey this is going to cause problems

00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,210
down that it saw that there was enough

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,520
of

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,230
problem it was a pixel off of one thing

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,760
that it made me start investigated and

00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,380
realized that I shouldn't go to 7-3 yet

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,399
with my son up I should like fix that

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,370
then go to 7/3

00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:56,559
but back stop let me do it and thousands

00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,600
and thousands and thousands of more more

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,090
than you could probably ever install

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,600
through GUI and the weight on these

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,279
things it's very minimal it does not

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,890
slow down your machine that's the kicker

00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:10,690
on all this now you can have a thousand

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,850
command-line tools waiting at your

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,799
disposal and you don't have to wait for

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,320
them to open up true story there's one

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,289
from imagemagick called convert I can

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,899
convert any image from any any format to

00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:24,490
any other format and under a second just

00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,720
by typing what I want it to do I don't

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,370
have to open Photoshop I don't mess

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,039
around with the GUI and I pick a menu I

00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,120
just say can convert image with this

00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:34,750
extension to the image with this

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,169
extension done it just does it thousands

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,940
more

00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,270
all right I'm literally out of time but

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,149
I have got another half of this to go

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:45,130
there's this ability in bash to do bash

00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:49,179
profiles bash RC is what it's called

00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,100
resource in Linux but it lets you say

00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:54,940
hey bash behave like this when I use you

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:57,490
but only when I use you so I can say hey

00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:01,600
when I type SL I actually meant tell us

00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:03,820
when I type LA I mean LA - a Alice - a

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,809
Alex the same thing or something really

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,880
long like I want to open up Firefox I

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,990
thought it's faster than spotlight

00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,090
search because I'm always in the

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,980
terminal myself or Weather Underground

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:18,429
which will w/e which will give me the

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,649
Weather Underground is that really fun

00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:22,450
yes is it - practical I don't know but

00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:24,460
get Porsche origin/master really is

00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,630
that's like that's 18 characters I don't

00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,870
have to type every time I do a git push

00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:33,190
to save myself that much life

00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:36,340
that adds up a lot over time expose in

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,809
paths setting paths and your thing this

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,020
just tells bash where to go look for

00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:42,789
that program so very easy I don't like

00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,020
the type of command for something it

00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:45,220
isn't working just set a path for it and

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,960
say hey all right next time I type it's

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,809
gonna open that but again this is just

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,580
for you so bash overall on your machine

00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:52,710
doesn't default to these things it's

00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,000
just for you

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,350
it's a very safe way to do it again this

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,400
is more for the tutorial side of how to

00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,110
actually

00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,130
then we get to the most powerful part

00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:06,330
about bashing you scripting this is the

00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:10,809
first script you probably ever write

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:13,000
hello world but in this we can learn so

00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:14,440
much there's so much here that what if

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,660
you configure if you understand what

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,790
this says there's nothing you can't do

00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,530
I promise you this is where everybody

00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,450
starts so let's talk about what we're

00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:26,650
seeing on this screen the very first

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:28,120
line so bash is for moving things around

00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,100
and then evaluating the files and what

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,790
to do with them the very first line bash

00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,919
encounters tells it what to do so

00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:41,110
literally it's called the shebang the

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,730
hashtag bang it says hey bash after this

00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,940
I'm gonna tell you what program to use

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,500
to execute whatever is in this file it

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,410
doesn't have to be bash you can do this

00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:53,679
for a lot of things like python ruby

00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:56,049
it's how you set the top first line cell

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,480
bash what to do with it what runtime

00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:00,010
environment to use just happens to be on

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,610
my machine then bash is the where

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:06,100
bachelors then hash tags are the

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,230
comments there after that first line

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,669
hash tags just mean ignore this don't

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:13,419
don't worry about it

00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:15,100
call it with a shell name and you give

00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:18,250
it permissions to run

00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,660
Shema change the file mode this gets

00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,770
dangerous and weird because the first

00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,320
time you encounter you're like what on

00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,730
earth do I do with this I just hit seven

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,190
five five and you're probably gonna be

00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:29,559
ok then you'll figure out what that

00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:32,530
means over time or plus X a plus X is

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,780
what I use a lot again no time today to

00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,750
get into really what that means and then

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,910
you just tell bash to evaluate that file

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:43,179
so you type dot which means present

00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,620
directory i'm in slash name the file so

00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:47,830
if you want to invoke a file that's

00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,630
somewhere else on your machine just tell

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,950
bash the full name of that path so we

00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,990
can go evaluate the file that's at the

00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,669
end of that path and then it'll do

00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,860
whatever that file tells it to do

00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:58,720
that's all scripting really does you can

00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,700
build like local been folders who can

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,110
like do things really fast and then

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,790
actually write type SH or worry about

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,260
how you're gonna format the line just

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:09,110
tell it hey if it's in here evaluate it

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:13,730
so

00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:14,960
tested this earlier and I tested earlier

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:21,549
and then I didn't actually bother to

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:24,860
make it thing clear a little bigger so

00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:30,230
well blab demos so they got listless

00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:31,760
lists which will take forever because

00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,230
I'm in a hurry

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,880
what's this this is a real programmer

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,799
and about once a week to check on the

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,290
health status before work websites that

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,400
I run I have machines that we'll get to

00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:44,299
later other scripting tell you what

00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,100
we'll come back and look at its output

00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:48,260
in a second instead of me waiting on a

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,590
green screen but it will go through and

00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,320
look at use WP CLI to invoke across

00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,090
these four sites actually rewritten this

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,470
lately to use a number in command so

00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,210
it's taking a little bit longer to

00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,700
actually pull the names of the sites

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:05,000
from something else but could give me a

00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,169
report or I do this this is a real again

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,649
these are real things I actually use in

00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:12,560
my real life opening these Firefox

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:14,869
windows to these addresses and then warm

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,490
the caches on these two sites for a demo

00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:19,970
I do it's the weekly demo at 10 a.m. on

00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:21,800
Wednesdays in Pantheon you want to build

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,600
demo websites I do whole out of those

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,919
one time I had to build 80 in a day and

00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,149
I was like I can't build AV in a day

00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:27,710
that would take me forever so I build a

00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,760
script to build me 80 in a day and this

00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,440
is the script and you can go get it

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,460
yourself and we run the exact same thing

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,919
I ran how I actually post comments are

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,290
content to my blog is I ship it to

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:41,570
github my machine grabs from github it

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,250
pushes it on to my dev environment B hat

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,659
tested to make sure behaviorally it does

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,080
exactly what I wanted it to do and that

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:49,580
the links didn't break then it ships

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,169
into my test environment tested with

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,879
backstop to make sure its pixel to pixel

00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:54,109
the same thing that like configuration

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,700
was the same between those two

00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:58,220
environments if that all works then the

00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:01,600
shipping to production just a giant bash

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:05,390
script you can have it if you want or

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:09,500
you want to know that your website got

00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:12,680
updated because a robot woke up once a

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,720
week to go check and see if there is

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,130
updates update the site in a different

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,570
environment then we run a bunch of tests

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,880
against it and push the production if it

00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,170
wall worked these are real scripts these

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,890
are real scripts that I actually use on

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:28,530
a regular basis

00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:29,940
and hmm operation timeout I think I'm on

00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,230
a port issue right now because I

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,160
switched Wi-Fi networks right before

00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,380
this that's what I did

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,010
so that ran because of report issues

00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:40,080
anyway but the rest of this is like wow

00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,600
that's that's the basics if you

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,340
understand those general concepts I said

00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,410
there's the basic commands there's tools

00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,270
you can use there's aliases and their

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,790
scripts

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:53,130
that's bash nothing terrifying about

00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:56,610
that but I asked the internet and I said

00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:58,620
hey where hey back there what are some

00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,900
tips about this and immediately like I'm

00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,730
talking within a day 30 people got back

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,730
to me and said hey there's all these

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,530
tips like it you can autocomplete just

00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:12,180
by hitting tab you can make aliases for

00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:15,150
things you can type up to go to the back

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,490
your last commands oh so I'm still

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,180
evaluating that program in our and I

00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,330
can't get to it

00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,840
clearly yeah here's all the commands I

00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:28,040
run for a while get checkouts and PM's

00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,040
doing a lot of testing with NPM stuff

00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,040
controlling ctrl a to jump up cool in

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,110
the front and back up a line so if I

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,010
type there and control a surely I can

00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,830
jump around

00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,900
yes exactly I wondered something I

00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,550
learned so much doing this the reverse

00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,090
command search I'm not gonna show it off

00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:46,530
but check it out you will love it the

00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:52,110
Astra character one of those powerful

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:58,920
characters and all of bash it's okay no

00:36:52,110 --> 00:37:01,260
yeah that's clear and uh I'm doing an

00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,760
alias for changing the desktop oh oh

00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,480
yeah so I got all these screenshots I'm

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,780
going to RM minus RF the dangerous one

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:11,190
SCR so everything that is starts with

00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,050
SCR then anything after it I'm just

00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,310
going to remove do another LS all my

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,510
screenshots are gone cuz I don't need

00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,650
them anymore because their screenshots

00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,990
and I won't keep you screenshots around

00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,700
I don't need to what does cleanup work

00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,890
but the Astra character super powerful

00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,840
that guy that supposedly just leader his

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,670
entire machine did an RM minus F at with

00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,980
a root level against asterisks and it

00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,680
just wiped out everything it didn't

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,940
actually happen but tab pipe pipe I

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,390
didn't talk about pipe because it on

00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:40,210
time but the most powerful thing about

00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:42,640
the scripting and why it one why shell

00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,650
is the standard and why seashell didn't

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,530
win is you can take the output from one

00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:50,680
command and insert that output into

00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:53,080
anything else you have literally pipe it

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,420
from here to here so you can run

00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,010
programs that go programmatically get

00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,230
information pull it back into the

00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:02,950
program and then use that information to

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:04,810
keep running the program nobody else had

00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,960
really figured that out before born for

00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:11,340
Steven born but pipe the most important

00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,900
thing I think on that screen if you are

00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,820
wanting a really cool bash profile out

00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,140
of the box a lot of people have built

00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,610
them this is probably my favorite and

00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,150
Ted brought it up as well so I put it in

00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:23,700
this deck CD - CD - is the last channel

00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,720
button this saves you so much time

00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,880
because you can be in any crazy

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,620
directory you want and just CD - and

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,670
right back to the last directory or just

00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:35,050
in just like that very simple and then

00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,760
there's the advanced one where I told

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:39,370
you in the beginning with a if statement

00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,140
because in scripts you can do logic if

00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,520
statements and winds and loops and

00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,830
things like that

00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:49,720
that wins yeah do do whiles you can set

00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,120
strict mode and bash it's unofficial

00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,940
strict mode but still it says fail when

00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,620
anything bad happens so you don't

00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,240
actually push to production something

00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,070
that will break and then not tell you it

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,030
broke and then you figure out like a day

00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,830
later that you took down a rack of

00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,150
servers you like hey this is gonna take

00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,850
out our a few servers just break and

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,020
then tell me you broke it's everywhere

00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,310
it's literally every machine you've ever

00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,910
touched bash is probably in there

00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,010
somewhere

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,720
don't be afraid of it and you can google

00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,670
anything I like DuckDuckGo for

00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,210
documentation reasons it's just a little

00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:21,130
bit better

00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:23,080
finding actual docs I think and if

00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,670
you're like a South sounds good but I

00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,070
don't like the command-line I don't like

00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,990
typing things go Nutella hack tell hack

00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:33,580
calm this is still up and running from

00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:37,810
the mountain view from Stanford down a

00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:40,690
mountain view anyway it's a terminal

00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,820
inside of your browser that you can play

00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:45,550
Zork the original adventure game that's

00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,770
a tall text-based game for not primes do

00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,640
cows a piglet and all those other fun

00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,810
things you can this is where you can

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,180
watch Star Wars

00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,410
completely ASCII and you can't blow up

00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,460
your machine you can do anything in here

00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,470
and you're like oh they didn't blow up

00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,970

00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,440
