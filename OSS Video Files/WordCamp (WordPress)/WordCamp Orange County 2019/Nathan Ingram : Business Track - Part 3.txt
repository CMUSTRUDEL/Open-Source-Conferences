so I found the quote I found a quote

00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:15,910
that I liked this morning I thought it

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:19,340
read was by Henry Ford Henry Ford said

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,949
failure is simply the opportunity to

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,000
begin again but this time with more

00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:29,480
excuse me this time more intelligently I

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,119
really I really dig that quote and I

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,760
read it specifically before we talked to

00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,470
Nathan because I don't know if anybody's

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,469
here for the business track last year

00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,539
right and this was Nathan's first

00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:44,000
business track last year but I gotta

00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,559
tell ya I sat back here and I listened

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,480
to what this man had to say and I was

00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,980
inspired I I really I really enjoyed his

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,960
interview last year and so I wanted to

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,050
have him back this year so that he could

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,699
talk about his failures yeah so would

00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,210
you like to start sir Nathan yeah sure

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:02,210
yeah

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,340
so Greg get back by the way this is this

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,280
is a lot of fun so we could talk about

00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,110
how for years I neglected my family for

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,909
business or we could talk about how I

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,990
lost 1/3 of my income and health

00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,990
insurance in one day

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,780
why don't work oh god there's me don't

00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,610
you go to the time that I was sued by a

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,729
major telecommunications firm in federal

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,110
court uh-huh or we could talk about how

00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,049
I neglected health for years it's up to

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:31,040
you oh let's go for okay yeah we got we

00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:32,420
got 25 minutes okay all right I want to

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,210
start with family I think that's a great

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,840
one to talk about tell me about that Wow

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,100
okay so I think in my opinion your

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,049
greatest weakness is your greatest

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,970
strength taken to an extreme so you know

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,219
I I'm a helpful person I love to be

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,409
helpful I love to see other people grow

00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:54,560
and I love to go all in helping them do

00:01:51,409 --> 00:02:00,320
that right so the downside of that is

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:03,289
for years I got our receive affirmation

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,140
and my you know self-worth from being

00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:08,300
recognized as the hero by clients right

00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,520
I love anybody else struggles with that

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,410
so that's what I've dubbed the hero

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,690
syndrome and I'm working on some content

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,980
around that you know we've heard of the

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,500
imposter syndrome and this is sort of

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,840
the kissing cousin to imposter syndrome

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,430
but you know being the hero is addictive

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,150
and for years I would work late drop

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,550
everything

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,220
anytime a client would call email

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,020
whatever because I wanted to be the hero

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,030
you know wanted to be seen that way in

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,770
the clients eyes and the for some

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,500
clients it's not as bad but there are

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,200
other people other clients who will suck

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,480
the life out of you if you let them

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,550
right they will take advantage of that

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,680
and will not think twice about it and

00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,020
these are people who can never altima be

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,220
pleased and so for years I struggle with

00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,950
that and so how do you what's the flip I

00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,900
had how do you stay the hero

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,459
right because it is a good spot to be

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,100
and it's good for customer service and

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:06,260
it's it's go around but also sell have

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,870
set healthy boundaries yeah well that's

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,700
the key right is first of all something

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,830
has to happen deep in your soul to

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,350
realize that your ultimate worth is not

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,220
it does not come really out of outside

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:21,500
from other people anyway you have to

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,760
find that place of self-worth in your

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,800
own self we talked about some therapy

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,630
here therapy a good wise counselor is

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,120
good for anybody I don't care who you

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,450
are or where you are in life it's good

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,959
to have a trained person to just reflect

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:39,830
with but you know finding finding

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:42,080
self-worth in yourself rather than in

00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,360
your work or in a marriage relationship

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
or friendships it's got to come from

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,320
inside and when you do that that lets

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,510
you set healthy boundaries to protect

00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,060
the things that you feel are the most

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,739
important and not things not priorities

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,840
that are set by other people for you

00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:00,650
you were seeking some external

00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,290
affirmation yeah and and and and using

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,750
that for something else besides business

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,540
sure it was personal it was at least he

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,120
thought was personally fulfilling like

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,820
that I think that's it yeah I think I

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,709
think that's it and I think most people

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,450
I don't want to generalize my own

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:19,430
weakness but I think does that resonate

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,890
with you guys that you you find the need

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,330
to have other people affirm you and it's

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,740
it's not that that's necessarily a bad

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,479
thing I mean I think it's healthy to

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,729
affirm people matter of fact in the I

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,620
need a coaching group of freelancers and

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:31,750
one of the

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,130
have our group call every month one of

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,330
the first thing we do is celebrate you

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,100
know tell us something good that

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,229
happened in the last 30 days because you

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,610
know when you're in your tribe there are

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,199
very few other people who can appreciate

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,760
the fact that you solved that stupid

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,910
semicolon out of place problem in the

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,580
PHP you know so and it's good to be

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,870
affirmed but you know if you wake up in

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,490
the morning having to be affirmed by

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,620
someone else to feel like you're

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,940
worthwhile then it's it's it's difficult

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,030
but it's different coming from your

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,190
peers right then coming from somebody

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,910
that you're from a client's yeah or a

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,880
customer right correct yeah well yeah I

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:10,539
think yeah in some ways yeah okay yeah

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,660
all right what's the next one a list see

00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:15,190
oh so there was the day that I lost a

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,370
third of my income and health insurance

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:23,440
and one yeah well in one day okay so at

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:25,780
that time this was 2008 I was not in the

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,690
WordPress world yet it was shortly after

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,639
this I found WordPress but so I've been

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,500
I started building and selling websites

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,710
in 1995 I've been at this forever and

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,539
one of my big in those days my model was

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,599
you know I was in the Dreamweaver space

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:43,960
everything you know cut everything

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:46,930
ground up and you know few a fewer few

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,960
clients big retainers that was the model

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,349
right handful of clients you know five

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:57,070
six $8,000 $1500 retainers per client

00:05:53,349 --> 00:06:00,099
right and it was it was good money until

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,020
it's not good money so in two how many I

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,570
remember what was going on in 2008 right

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,630
the bottom fell out right so one of my

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:10,030
biggest clients was ironically a hair

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,479
salon in Birmingham Alabama where I'm

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,099
from and I you know had been serving

00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,139
these people for a long time I was doing

00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:20,650
everything under the Sun for them print

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,419
design graphic design some webs some

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,169
video photography everything basically

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,669
they needed

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,729
I was selling anything I could at that

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:30,699
point to you know make ends meet and I

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:33,400
walked in one day and the economy tanked

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,810
and they brought me to the office yeah I

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,490
thought I was there to just fix a couple

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,289
of little problems they brought me in

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,610
the office and said I'm sorry after this

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,919
month that's going to be it and it was

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,480
the end of the month and so not only

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,950
were they did they represent a

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,560
third of the income that was coming into

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,820
my business but they also were providing

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,580
health insurance for my family

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,980
so I walked out of that place that day

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,210
and you know they were in a big mall and

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,460
so you had the park on the other end of

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,530
the parking lot if you had working

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,030
association with a business and that was

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,460
the longest walk I ever had in my life

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,170
and it's I'm thinking okay I've got to

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,660
call my wife and explain to her that

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,010
honey we've just lost a third of our

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,180
income and health insurance right I had

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:15,250
two small kids that sucked but I

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,380
remember on that that walk to my car I

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,290
can still I can still see it in my head

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,540
right now I realized and I told myself I

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,000
will never let this happen again I will

00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,820
never let this happen again and the the

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,010
business take away from that is if you

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,200
have one client that represents that big

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,750
of a stake in your business you are it's

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,670
it's a it's a ticking time bomb because

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,750
when that client who consumes a lot of

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,380
the oxygen in your world drops out

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,960
you're in trouble

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,430
so I began that was the day where my

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,680
business model began to change

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,200
I was dabbling in WordPress at that time

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,960
I started exploring more and I pivoted

00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,410
my whole business model away from these

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,870
large retainers for a few clients into

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,850
smaller WordPress care plans for lots of

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,680
different clients and now if a client

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,330
drops it's okay we have plenty more they

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,920
represent a very small percentage of

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,640
overall income is there a certain

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,350
percentage that you won't let go over I

00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,840
mean is there I know it's kind of feel

00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,850
but you know obviously a third is too

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,530
big yes and you know I don't know that I

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,480
could put a percentage on it okay but

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,920
you know you you sort of get a gut

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,940
feeling okay this client is really

00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:27,310
taking a lot of my time in the in the in

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,960
the pie chart of my world and I'm

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,570
starting to rely on them too much and

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,830
you know that's it can be dangerous and

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,110
the other thing I'm hearing is it's a

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,750
third of your income right but it wasn't

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,820
a third of your head space that is a

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,260
great point right yeah because not only

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,599
you know when you have a client that is

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,820
consuming that much oxygen and they're

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,250
paying you you know that much money you

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,490
know and at first it looks great yet the

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,590
amount of thought time and worry time

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,760
about keeping this client you know

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,200
because when that client calls you're

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,100
gonna stop everything right which feeds

00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,240
into the first thing which

00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,680
talked about right you know if they

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,570
called on a Saturday and I'm having fun

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,860
with my family I'm gonna stop and take

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,690
that call and go spend an hour working

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,970
on their problem which just totally

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,650
blows the family day sure it's really

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,350
hard to set up boundaries when you are

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,120
depending on that neck line for so much

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,580
and so the flip side of that is okay

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,560
it's a thirty year income it's more than

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,840
the third of your head space just for

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,930
your focus but also what's that costing

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:29,230
you opportunity cost wise on the on the

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,970
backside yeah so a lot because as if

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,830
you're especially if you how many of you

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,550
you're freelancers in here like you're

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,900
that okay awesome you're my tribe so

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,540
when you're the only person or whether

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,400
you're onner even in a small team you

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,430
have to wear all the hats you just have

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,080
to so you have if you have a client or

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,790
are you you know that one of the most

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,030
dangerous things a freelancer can do is

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,560
take on a huge project it is and that

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,420
sounds crazy but if you have a project

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,610
that's going to consume your life for

00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,040
six months it looks great because this

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,390
big pile of income comes in but guess

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,770
what you're probably not gonna have the

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,750
time to do the marketing and network in

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,850
whatever so what happens at the end of

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,610
that six months is cash flow goes to

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,220
zero right unless you have a really good

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,630
healthy recurring revenue stream so it's

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,580
incredibly dangerous if you're not

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,560
wearing all your letting one client

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,450
consume all the headspace and you're not

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,180
balanced in all the things you have to

00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,740
do in your business you you could put

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,940
yourself out of business yeah that's a

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,830
great point great point real quick

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,680
before going to the the third story

00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,270
right anybody who did raise their hand

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,920
at freelancer or anyway in the room can

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,350
they relate to what Nathan's saying here

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,690
that you've got a client that pays you

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,940
less than what they're taking in your

00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:45,090
headspace is that is that familiar okay

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:49,090
good well make its progress yes next

00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:50,860
well so this there was the day I was

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,440
sued by a national telecommunications

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,210
firm in federal court okay that was a

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,530
bad day it started with a sheriff

00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,930
knocking on my door serving me some

00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,040
papers oh this was in the early days of

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:06,070
the internet I think it would have been

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:09,010
1990 it was late 96 or early 97 and I

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,360
was our first little web venture I was

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,360
living in a small town in Louisiana

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,329
and our first big client right my first

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,820
client was the the Parrish County the

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:21,730
Parrish economic development office and

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,160
we had a little web server and you know

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,130
and some things got posted on that web

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,329
server that were defamatory towards a

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:33,360
large telecommunicator fam'ly Tory will

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,620
say right toward this large

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,230
telecommunications firm which you would

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,060
all you know recognize immediately if I

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,740
told you and you know we thought we

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,269
dealt with the issue it was a mistake

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,089
you know we dealt with the same day and

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:48,220
then you know about ten weeks later on a

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,720
Monday morning 8 o'clock sheriff's

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,110
deputy knocks on my door and hands me a

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,540
paper that's a lawsuit and I'm you know

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,570
at that point I'm like 24 years old I'm

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:03,850
making nothing you know just newly

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:06,880
married yeah I was petrified absolutely

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,040
petrified and the other the the you know

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,079
it's a it's a long story but it turns

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,079
out okay we we had a lawyer that got

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,610
aggravated that we were being picked on

00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,560
our attorneys take was they're trying to

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,839
establish some case law no internet case

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,829
law existed at that time and so they

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,839
were trying to get some case law

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:24,579
established on an easy case and he took

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,130
the case pro bono we went in and the

00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:28,779
judge threw it out it was you know but

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,000
the takeaway from that is be real

00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,209
careful who your partners are because

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,449
somebody did some things and I became

00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:39,610
responsible for them and it turned into

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:41,170
about 18 months of pretty much hell sure

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,720
worry and anxiety you know not being

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,370
able to have a lot of peace internally

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:51,160
about what was gonna happen next

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:53,890
sure okay before number four that yeah

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,600
so that's the the health conversation

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,410
yeah let's talk about that because you

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,190
had recently going through

00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,470
transformation

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,490
yeah so when I was here last year I

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,690
weighed 270 pounds I'm five foot six and

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,300
since December the 10th the day after I

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:11,160
came back from work Camp us I've lost

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,160
about 80 pounds congratulations

00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:19,609
so it's it's hard when you work behind a

00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:23,569
desk all day right it is hard to focus

00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:26,149
on health and this is this is it's just

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:29,029
a new priority for me and what it's

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:30,139
turned into is realizing lots of things

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:31,879
that I've let slide

00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:35,149
you know the business take away from

00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:37,459
that is you know there are so many

00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:41,419
little micro habits that you can

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:43,220
establish in your world not only on the

00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:45,230
health side but on the business side to

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,209
increase your productivity to increase

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,949
your health to just do small things you

00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,299
know how many of it we know we should be

00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,069
drinking more water right we hear that

00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:54,350
all the time drink more water you know

00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:55,879
how I drink more water I have water

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,569
within arm's reach all day how many how

00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,040
stupid is that

00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,410
but if it's there I'm gonna drink it

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,079
right it's little things like that

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,489
little small things you can do in your

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,249
life and in your business that if you'll

00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:09,769
just do this little thing those micro

00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:14,839
habits build up - big time avalanche

00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:16,639
change great so one thing I'm gonna pick

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,519
out of what one of them I've said is you

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,660
mentioned the the D word Dreamweaver

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,399
there there anybody else in the room

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,419
that that I recognize from the

00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,419
Dreamweaver support group

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,540
you've been building websites for as

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,220
long as I've done websites right I

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,780
started my company in 1995 you started

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,070
you started selling since 1995 right and

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,190
this is a little bit off topic but how

00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:50,250
did you make that transition from

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:53,130
building everything by hand to this - to

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,580
WordPress - this is such a fun story so

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:59,490
I did a talk in Jacksonville two years

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,590
it I was last year and it was in the the

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,950
Gutenberg crisis right we all survived

00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,050
that the Sun came up afterwards like it

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:10,170
was like y2k

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:14,850
[Laughter]

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:16,920
I hate WordPress that's perfect for the

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,430
video can we uh can we get that snippet

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,810
on Twitter

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:24,360
I had a big slide it said I hate

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:27,150
WordPress in this talk and that's those

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,980
words came out of my mouth in 2008

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,900
I hate WordPress it's gonna ruin my

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,510
business okay which is ironically what

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:38,100
people said about Gutenberg right right

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:39,900
yeah so and it was it was in that in

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,370
that phase of my life that I described

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,130
earlier where everything I was all-in on

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,920
Dreamweaver all-in on you know several

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:49,110
good clients big retainers and here

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,970
comes this WordPress thing and it lets

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,060
people edit their website they are you

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:57,090
know they are taking away my ability to

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,940
sell this thing that I do right and so

00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,530
it required a major pivot and it took

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,360
some time for me in it that was actually

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,660
that that story that I told earlier that

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,550
was the pivotal change for me of

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,220
realizing this you know this model that

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,660
I had is not sustainable anyway people

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,460
want to be able to edit their websites

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,780
well some do how many have you had

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:20,010
wordpress clients that never login to

00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:22,800
their website anyway yeah me too but you

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:26,250
know that started the process what

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,780
really sold me on WordPress was we were

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,370
building a site for a client who needed

00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,690
a dealer locator you know they had a

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,460
product it was going to be in dealers

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,530
and you know I reached out to my

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,020
developer and it was going to be about

00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,390
you know eighteen hundred two thousand

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,760
dollars to build that by hand and then I

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,490
found a wordpress plugin for $39

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:48,360
did it already I thought there might be

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,610
something to this is that's that's a lot

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,790
of margin Peppa you can just buy this

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,740
and install it and it works right so and

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,840
then I slowly discovered the WordPress

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,480
community which is the best part about

00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,010
WordPress and realizing not only are

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,170
there people who have probably already

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,000
thought about problems that I already

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:09,000
have and likely already have a solution

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,079
but there's this immense community of

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,880
people who are just amazing I've had the

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,740
privilege to you know to be the over 50

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,320
word camp so far across the United

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,550
States and Canada and it's everywhere

00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,829
every WordPress community I've ever been

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,120
in is amazing just people who are

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,230
willing to give willing to share I mean

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,740
here you are you're standing up here

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,480
sharing with yeah it's an amazing thing

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,150
that we amazing thing we have the

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,530
privilege of being part of cool all

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,280
right we've got questions for Nathan we

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:42,390
covered a lot in this but I guess you

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:51,300
covered it all got it Oh back there hey

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:55,320
what one sec go ahead how did I lose the

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:58,230
80 pounds it's it's a plan I'm on that's

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,420
its but bills but based around eating

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,920
every two to three hours a small meal

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,290
and then one meal at night which I'm

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,510
happy to talk to you more offline if you

00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,040
want to do that but yeah but like

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,230
everything else you talked about it

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,980
sounds like even your health needed to

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,960
be a process that's it and so I watched

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:23,420
a friend of mine who is my health coach

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:27,150
drop 200 pounds easy well that's a easy

00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:29,280
at least 200 pounds and kept it off for

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,270
a few years and I finally talked to it I

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,310
watched some other people she was

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,080
helping do the same thing and like look

00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,490
is this is this a plan that's easy

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,410
enough where I could stick to and and

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,360
follow exam I'm very much a process

00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,590
person I have a checklist for it you

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,390
know when I go to a work camp I've got a

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,310
checklist in Trello to plant you know -

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,940
yeah - you know make sure I don't forget

00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:49,230
stuff if it's got a checklist and a plan

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,160
that I can follow I'm gonna do it I'm

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,020
gonna execute on it

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,990
and that's what this was it was an easy

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,650
plan that you know to follow that you

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,830
know it's a

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,690
yes and really I mean that's no matter

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,730
what you do if you can figure out how to

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,770
turn that into a process that you can

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,510
follow and just be accountable that

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,150
process you're gonna you're gonna be

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,320
better so a different question what are

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,150
the other things I was thinking about is

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,220
you telling all these stories right one

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,360
of the things one of the things that and

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,760
it's wonderful that you've shared

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,170
everybody your experiences because they

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,760
can take away from your experiences

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,010
hopefully learn from what you've gone

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,250
through but is there a way when you're

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:28,320
in the moment right especially with your

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,460
family right yeah and and that resonates

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,500
with me because I've been through that

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,270
before as well yeah it's hard to

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,130
recognize that you're neglecting

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,690
something right you're neglecting your

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,850
family when you're in that moment you

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,250
can't see it right it's all mostly if

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,320
you got blinders on right can't see it

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,130
is there anything that you've discovered

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,290
over the years that you can kind of step

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,690
outside of that moment and say okay I

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,460
need to shift something or do something

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,590
differently is there a process that

00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:00,530
you've discovered for that man okay yeah

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:03,420
so I'll answer that two ways first it

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:10,110
inside yourself you have to be willing

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:13,320
to be wrong it's a great take away pride

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,960
is the enemy oh right I mean you can

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,790
learn that from lots of sources you know

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,140
from the Bible to Greek mythology you

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:23,640
know hubris gets you nowhere right sure

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:27,300
if you're not willing to be vulnerable

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,960
and teachable by people first of all

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:34,260
you're a jerk second of all I mean your

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,050
success will be limited you have to be

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,030
open to be instructed by people the

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,070
second thing is you have to have people

00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,710
in your life who have the privilege of

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:47,220
calling you out on stuff you have to

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,480
have relationships you know mine starts

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,480
with my marriage and then a couple of

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,790
close friends who have the the open door

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,310
to say you're really missing it right

00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,200
here because we can fool ourselves into

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,420
anything we can talk ourselves into

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,680
anything you can make excuses for

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:06,720
anything we can fool ourselves very

00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,610
easily so you have to have somebody on

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,100
the outside looking in

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,169
to say you're really missing it right

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,909
here and you and you need to you need to

00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:16,500
change this but then you have to be

00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:17,340
humble enough to say you know what

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,840
you're right

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:24,169
yeah good good life lesson yes one more

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,169
Jeff

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,820
Thank You Nathan one of the things I'm

00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,380
taking away because the more

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,090
business-oriented I'm really trying to

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,250
get something started up off the ground

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,659
and I'm curious to hear from your point

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,019
of view because you work with so many

00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,789
other freelancers agencies what have you

00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:47,010
have you recognized some top three or

00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:48,419
maybe five traits that you can tell from

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,820
an offset is going to make a business

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,740
very successful for example I heard you

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,970
talk a little bit about adaptability and

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,440
we all know that you need that in

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,610
business so I'm curious to hear what

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,620
other traits you think your

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,899
characteristics are key to to a

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,929
successful venture so what yeah what's

00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:08,120
what traits do you think can predict

00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:10,559
success Wow okay

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,630
that some of your questions that's

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:18,899
that's a good question

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:21,840
personal traits or that's up to you okay

00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:23,880
so what I just said I think is a good

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,610
way to answer that question just and to

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,760
start out I think anyone who's

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,950
successful is vulnerable needs to be

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,559
vulnerable needs to realize they don't

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:37,559
have the whole picture because you know

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,840
you can go so far on your own but

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,059
without a good team of people around you

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,289
you're limited nobody has the whole

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,929
picture I mean just in the human

00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:47,519
condition you know I think everybody has

00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,840
a gift everybody has a superpower and

00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,059
figuring out what that is and then

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,639
monetizing it is the core but then

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,500
bringing people around you to you know

00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:57,450
instead of trying to improve the areas

00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,250
where you're weak bring people around

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,799
you who already have strengths where

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:04,409
you're weak whatever those areas may be

00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,179
you know a really good developer is

00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:10,580
never going to be a really good designer

00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:13,440
and vice versa you know a person who is

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,519
you know great being a developer is

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,269
probably not going to be a good

00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,210
salesperson

00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:21,330
those those skills rarely reside in the

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,140
same person so but it comes down to that

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,049
core

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,120
aspect of vulnerability and humility of

00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,279
realizing I don't have all the answers

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,010
myself so either you know you bring

00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,330
around a formal team as employees or

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,210
contractors or just have strategic

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:39,659
partnerships with other groups or other

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,519
freelancers to have a piece of the pie

00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,320
that you don't have right and just

00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,890
building that Network and growing that I

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,750
think that's a great place to start

00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,750
