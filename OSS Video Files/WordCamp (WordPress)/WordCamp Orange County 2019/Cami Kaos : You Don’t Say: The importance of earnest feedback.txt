Publication date: 2019-05-14
Playlist: WordCamp Orange County 2019
Description: 
	Feedback, given or received, can be a gift or a curse. Explore the subtle art of communicating feedback in a way that’s beneficial to both sides while also helping the overall health of the project you share. I’ll draw from examples in open source communities, collaborations, and Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest to help attendees understand how everyone benefits when feedback is given about products and projects instead of individuals. While we’re in a feedback mindset I’ll talk about how to share critical feedback about the folks we work with while remembering that the person on the other end of the internet is a human too.
