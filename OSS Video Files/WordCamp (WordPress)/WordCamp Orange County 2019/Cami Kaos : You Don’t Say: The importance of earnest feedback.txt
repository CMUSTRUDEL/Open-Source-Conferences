Title: Cami Kaos : You Don’t Say: The importance of earnest feedback
Publication date: 2019-05-14
Playlist: WordCamp Orange County 2019
Description: 
	Feedback, given or received, can be a gift or a curse. Explore the subtle art of communicating feedback in a way that’s beneficial to both sides while also helping the overall health of the project you share. I’ll draw from examples in open source communities, collaborations, and Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest to help attendees understand how everyone benefits when feedback is given about products and projects instead of individuals. While we’re in a feedback mindset I’ll talk about how to share critical feedback about the folks we work with while remembering that the person on the other end of the internet is a human too.

Cammi chaos that's right

00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,990

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,510
parents and plays in the rainy city of

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,520
Portland Oregon she's had a love of

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,080
WordPress and word camps since she

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,750
stumbled upon the first word camp

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,070
Portland when she became a reluctant and

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,660
then excited volunteer she now works at

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,930
automatic a little company may have

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,210
heard of it as a community organizer for

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,410
the WordPress open-source project where

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:48,660
she gets to gets to work with word camps

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:59,129
and their organizers every day caddy

00:00:48,660 --> 00:01:02,039
cast hi welcome to you you don't say the

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,539
importance of earnest feedback one of my

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,990
favorite place is the importance of

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,180
Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde and one of

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,800
my favorite things currently is to talk

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,070
about feedback and the importance of

00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,420
feedback and when I get nerdy about one

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,520
thing I tend to like rope in other

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,530
things that I'm nerdy about and and so

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,600
when I was thinking about what's most

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,180
important and feedback I kept thinking

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,580
about being earnest and being honest and

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,409
so you will have to bear with me as I

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,740
loose ly tie the importance of being

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,259
earnest to this talk throughout it

00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,150
before we dive in um I always like to

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,759
know a little bit about the person who

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,229
is talking at me so that I can feel a

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,850
little more comfortable so I'm going to

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,000
introduce myself not that Dave didn't do

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,369
a lovely job but I am cami chaos and he

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,400
did pronounce my name correctly and yes

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,380
that is my real name and yes it is

00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,540
spelled just like the agents of chaos on

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,820
get smart if you happen to love that

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,590
television show I'm a community

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,890

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,290
project and I focus on word camps so if

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,909
any of you are organizers or volunteers

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,000

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:13,140
saying thank you I grew up in California

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,420
and in Texas but I did relocate to

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,610
Portland about 25 years ago where I live

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,620
with my partner my teenage daughter two

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,140
very old cats and more plants than I'm

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,580
comfortable admitting to you right now

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,160
if you need to find me anywhere on the

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,470
Internet

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,000
you can find me as cami chaos almost

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,610
everywhere except for Gmail because

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,960
someone took that before I got it and if

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,670
you need to contact me for some reason

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,510
you can email me at cami chaos at

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,950
automatic calm and just so we get this

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:45,160
out of the way this is my very first

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:47,200
word Campo si and now that you know some

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,540
stuff about me I'd like to get to know

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,740
you a little bit because I'm going to

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,080
that dreadful audience-participation

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,660
thing this is the last half before lunch

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,080
and I'm hungry and I know all of you are

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,350
hungry so who else is this their first

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,840
word Campo si you're lying put your hand

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:12,700
down thank you okay

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:14,440
is it anyone's first word camp welcome

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,750
to word camp Oh see and welcome to word

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,790
campus and it might be weird to have

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,930
somebody welcome you to a word camp and

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,170
when it's their first time to you but

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,850
I'm gonna do it anyway so now that we

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,350
know each other a little bit better we

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,850
have some trust and we have some common

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,040
ground I want to talk to you today about

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,440
feedback which is not necessarily a

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,200
common word camp discussion for people

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,720
to have but it's become really important

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,400
to me over the past few years to start

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,620
to recognize the way that we both give

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,750
and receive feedback not only in the

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,310
open-source project but within our work

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,180
relationships within our interpersonal

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,470
relationships and and so it's something

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,490
that I've gone nerdy about in the last

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,230
year and it's something that I've gotten

00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,850
really impassioned about and I want to

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,030
find a way to help other people learn to

00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,340
better give feedback at its most basic

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,890
feedback is one human being attempting

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,390
to help another human being no matter

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,040
how obscured or confused that

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,850
communication becomes because it can get

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,070
really muddled it can be shouting it can

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,600
be quiet

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,860
it can be completely confused sometimes

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,970
someone's giving you feedback and they

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,140
don't even know that they're doing it

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,489
but it is it's just basically a way to

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,870
communicate something that someone else

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,870
needs to know or something that you feel

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,700
you need someone else to know so before

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,110
we get too heavy into feedback I think

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,090
we need to kind of seek out and

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,010
acknowledge but our own personal

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,870
relationships with feedback are and

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,790
I'm sure there's someone in the room who

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:44,010
this isn't their relationship with

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,780
feedback but for me this is a visual

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,030
representation of my relationship with

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,710
feedback and some people might be like

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,100
oh my gosh you got a Jackson Pollock

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:57,450
slide it's amazing it's great art it's

00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:00,420
not this is messy and it is scary and it

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,050
is confusing and I did it in five

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,460
minutes

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,470
because I needed a slide here and I

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,290
didn't know what to do but feedback

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,010
makes me uncomfortable it makes me

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,780
nervous it makes me like want to do the

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,610
ostrich thing and stick my head in the

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,470
sand and just pretend I can't hear what

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,690
anyone's saying and that's giving

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,460
feedback and receiving feedback so

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,200
basically any time I have a meeting in

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,810
which I need to give or receive feedback

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,490
my impulse my first like natural

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,470
instinct is to cancel the meeting and

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,300
like start coughing and pretend I'm sick

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,460
because I don't want to say things to

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,050
people that they don't want to hear and

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,640
I don't want to hear things that I don't

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:41,460
want to hear right but as part of my

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,080
work and it is strangely enough it's

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,090
part of my entire life I have a partner

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,970
I have a daughter I have a community a

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,190
work community an open-source community

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,860
I've got school communities part of a

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,260
startup community and feedback is a

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,830
never-ending stream both receiving and

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,020
giving so not having a comfortable

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,000
feeling with feedback as you might

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,280
imagine can make things a little bit

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,260
difficult because what I would really

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,790
like to do is bolster people and make

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,160
them feel good about what they're doing

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,110
and give them the skills and the

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,310
information and the motivation to keep

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,070
working on what they're working on

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,290
whether that is WordPress contributors

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:22,530
whether that is my daughter

00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,480
whether that is my co-workers or whether

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,980
that is my partner who's an amazing chef

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,630
and I would really like to give him that

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,730
feedback so he'll continue cooking meals

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:34,380
for me but sometimes that feedback isn't

00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,350
great and so when you're bolstering it's

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:41,640
fantastic but you can't just say good

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:43,980
things and expect feedback to work this

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,460
is the last line in Oscar Wilde's The

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,930
Importance of Being Earnest

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,150
but I'm gonna call it a jumping-off

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,639
point I've now realized for the first

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,849
time in my life the vital importance of

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,319
Being Earnest and my take on this is

00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:59,349
completely different than the plays if

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,000
you've seen it The Importance of Being

00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:03,430
Earnest isn't the only thing to take

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,710
away here what I want you to understand

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,090
is that you can be honest and earnest

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,680
without saying everything that comes

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,960
into your head you can be honest and

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,880
open without being cruel and that

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,979
feedback isn't just something that you

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,449
happen to be good at it's not something

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,680
that you're like you woke up one day and

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,240
you're like I can tell people everything

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,400
and they will completely understand and

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,650
they will be able to apply that and make

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,419
themselves a better person it's not how

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,610
it works it is a skill it is something

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:30,430
that you have to gain and that you can

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,990
refine and that you can work on but for

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,690
some of us it takes getting out of our

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,539
comfort zones so I was seen in this last

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,970
slide how many of you would relate your

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:42,250
feelings about feedback either giving or

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,080
receiving more with this than with like

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:48,220
the trinkle nature of seeing we see

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:51,940
outside the window does anyone love

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,639
getting feedback I'm not sure if I

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,750
believe you but I'll take it if it was

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,500
someone else did you say you liked

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:02,520
getting feedback yeah what do you what

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,520
do you like about getting feedback

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:15,250
seeing a different point of view and

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:20,680
what about you okay good so you relish

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:25,419
it yeah all right you have to why do you

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,650
have to oh and yes you have to adapt

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:30,250
what you're doing to what they want

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,320
right so this is the audience

00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,550
community

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:03,790

anyone here like to tweet anyone here

00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:51,940

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,070
anyway what what's the last what is the

00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:04,230
last feedback that someone else gave any

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:08,020
kind of feedback at all you in the back

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,630
someone was asking me about a friend of

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,209
mine was asking about template tags in

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,980
WordPress so I gave him feedback showed

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,870
him a little bit of code mm-hmm solved

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,350
the problem and that was about a half an

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,779
hour ago

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:27,910
excellent well done and you over here

00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:30,149
you had some feedback excellent are any

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,680
of you involved in a mentor relationship

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,660
yeah anytime you mentor someone or are

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,390
being mentored that's the giving and

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,740
receiving a feedback anytime someone

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,860
hasn't done something that they should

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,810
do that's the giving of feedback there

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,570
are three general types of feedback and

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,279
so if any does anyone else have anything

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,020
they want to share about feedback that

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,500
they've given or received before we move

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,420
on to the types of feedback all right so

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,440
the examples that you throughout

00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,860
everything that I'm going to talk about

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,410
all falls into three categories

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,329
appreciation coaching and evaluation and

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:07,420
they're all incredibly common we don't

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:09,609
necessarily think about what kind of

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,989
feedback we're giving when we're giving

00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:13,689
and I feel like it's common knowledge

00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:15,819
what each of those means but as my

00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:18,100
partner and some very very smart other

00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:20,049
people say common sense is not common in

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,009
fact it's only common to you so I want

00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:23,170
to make sure that we have a common

00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:24,609
ground in a common understanding of what

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,699
each of these three types of feedback

00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:30,639
are the first one is appreciation and

00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:34,600
this is where you tell me how much you

00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:37,509
liked my talk thank you that's lovely

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,339
feedback awesome appreciation is

00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:41,679
fundamentally about the human

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:44,410
relationship and connections but in a

00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,059
project like ours is very important work

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,999
like making sure that you show

00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:51,009
appreciation is what keeps the wheels

00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:55,149
moving in open source projects in

00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:57,459
volunteer positions in nonprofits when

00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,959
you appreciate someone or something that

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:01,149
someone is doing you're making sure that

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,649
they feel heard you're making sure that

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,139
they realize that their work means

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,869
something to someone you're saying I see

00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,799
you and you're recognizing that they

00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:11,410
exist and that they matter

00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,179
the problem with appreciation is that

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,610
sometimes we don't understand how to

00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:18,220
keep it appropriate and how to keep it

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,269
on topic and so when you're appreciating

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,660
someone make sure that you're

00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,529
appreciating them in a way that is

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,980
specific and appropriate to the

00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:28,749
relationship that you have with someone

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,369
for as an example you walk around a word

00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,470
camp and someone says something really

00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:35,019
smart and it's fantastic to be like that

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,279
thing that you said was life-altering it

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:37,660
caused me to think about things in a

00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,499
completely different way thank you so

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,660
much you're very wise that's great

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:45,579
walking up to someone and saying hey

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,910
your hair smells amazing when you don't

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,910
know them

00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:55,449
it is appreciation it is awkward and it

00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:57,489
is not kind of a welcome source of

00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:59,829
feedback unless that happens to be like

00:12:57,489 --> 00:13:01,989
your kid hey did you change shampoo your

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,699
hair smells great or your partner so

00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,769
make sure that you keep appreciation

00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:08,139
appropriate to the level of relationship

00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:14,739
that you have with the person you're

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:16,329
sharing it with coaching coaching is

00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:18,769
aimed at trying to help someone get

00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:20,420
better or to grow and change

00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,790
sometimes it's getting out of a box that

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,379
they have placed themselves in sometimes

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,679
it's improving something that they're

00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:29,540
already doing but coaching is a way to

00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,850
take someone who has knowledge and

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,679
gained experience and share it with

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,470
other people so when we talked about

00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,110
mentoring earlier mentoring is is a form

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,809
of coaching coaching is obviously a form

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,819
of coaching and I know I saw some hands

00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:50,569
earlier people who will have like a

00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:55,610
formal mentor relationship yeah you look

00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:57,860
like you want to talk what am I saying

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,829
so you're in are you the mentor or the

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,769
mentee I am the mentor yeah and what are

00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:06,860
you mentoring on I trained somebody to

00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:11,660
be a front-end developer from nothing to

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,579
working in marketing in firm he just got

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,259
his job so it's been two years of me

00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,259
working with him over the Internet's

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,049
it's it's very fun and also quite

00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,269
frustrating sometimes I love him to

00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:29,089
death what is the what is the most

00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:31,069
rewarding aspect of that feedback the

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,980
appreciation the feedback the mentor

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:36,939
relationship seeing somebody gets

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:41,809
something good for all their work really

00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:44,990
and what's the most frustrating I'm

00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:46,610
gonna repeat myself okay yeah oh my gosh

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,379
I feel that way especially when I know

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:52,850
that someone is very good at taking

00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:54,799
notes yeah and that slides into

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,429
evaluation coaching an evaluation or

00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,199
like anxiety and depression they're best

00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:02,089
friends

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,610
coaching and evaluation often slide back

00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,069
and forth with one another appreciation

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,649
can sneak in there too but evaluation

00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:15,110
should not be emotional it shouldn't be

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:17,779
easy it should be based in context it's

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,429
an assessment it is an evaluation of how

00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,589
you're doing and this is the form of

00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:23,480
feedback that at least in America we

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:25,839
start children with the very earliest

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,339
you send a child to kindergarten and

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,320
they get a report card and it might not

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,570
be the letter scale

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,699
but we tell them what they're doing we

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:38,269
evaluate their performance we evaluate

00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:39,949
their behavior we say hey you're doing

00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,959
this well or hey you're doing this

00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:45,079
poorly thumbs up good job

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:48,889
thumbs down mmm we need to redo the

00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:52,250
finger painting and then we keep moving

00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:53,870
on and we strengthen and deepen the

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,519
understanding of what that evaluation is

00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,230
with the letter grades ABCD we skip e F

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,009
and that's our earliest relationship for

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:07,040
most people with feedback and evaluation

00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:10,910
but it's hard not to let it all uation

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,920
be clouded it's hard to just objectively

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,019
evaluate a situation or be objectively

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,360
evaluated without having some really

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:19,579
intense emotions around it because

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,769
unless someone is just saying yes you're

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,449
perfect thank you everything you have

00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:25,399
done is great that's definitely not

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,269
coaching that's just pure evaluation or

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,769
hey everything is awful and you're fired

00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:33,170
everything in the evaluation in-between

00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:36,829
is a way to then move into coaching and

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:39,620
improve what's happening clear feedback

00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,600
under has an understanding of what kind

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,490
of feedback you're giving so if you are

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,160
in a mentor relationship you should not

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,600
necessarily be evaluating them heavily

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,010
you do have to do a little bit of

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,110
evaluation because you need to know how

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,000
to help them move on but the goal there

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,430
is to teach them to grow and to help

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,800
them move further along if you are

00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,209
evaluating you should not be coaching or

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,740
mentoring you should be letting them

00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:03,019
know the facts of what's happening and

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,409
if you're appreciating someone thank you

00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:08,360
I appreciate that you appreciate people

00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:10,909
so if someone asks what you think design

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,049
of their most recent site and you answer

00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:16,970
that question you are evaluating them if

00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:19,159
someone asks you how they can improve

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,380
the design of their most recent site and

00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:23,059
you answer them you are coaching them if

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,589
someone asks what you think of their

00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:28,130
latest site and you just say it's

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:30,470
awesome nothing wrong here you go it's

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,020
evaluation and appreciation all right

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:36,860
but as I said before please keep all

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,630
topics relevant to what's going on you

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,210
don't want to get into a feedback loop

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,030
with people that is not on the level of

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,180
relationship

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:50,760
you have but also you need to be honest

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:52,520
and you need to not necessarily say

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,950
everything that comes into your head

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,270
because sometimes our relationship with

00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,640
the feedback we're giving is more

00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,990
problematic for ourselves than it is for

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,880
the person that we are giving feedback

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,720
to and this is something I haven't

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,370
always been terribly good at so when I

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,620
started learning about feedback heavily

00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,990
it was a class I took last year after my

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,240
sabbatical and one of the exercises that

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,060
we did we were asked to think of a time

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,950
that we had given feedback and then to

00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,510
look back at the feedback we'd given and

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,970
figure out what job we were trying to do

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,610
with it and so I'm going to tell you

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,250
what I consider to be a large feedback

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,220
error on my part that I experienced just

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,990
before I went on sabbatical last year I

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,370
had been preparing everyone for the fact

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,740
that I was going to be gone for three

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,210
months and letting them know that if

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,460
they needed to talk to someone at my

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,280
work they could email these the shared

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,030
queue and if someone would help them a

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,940
particular person that I had been

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:51,060
working with emailed the queue and said

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,670
I need to know who my contact is going

00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,880
to be well camis on maternity leave and

00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,740
my teammates saw this email and went oh

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,650
my gosh camis pregnant and she didn't

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,940
tell anybody and she really quickly

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,200
assigned it to me so that no one else

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,910
would see it and then she sent me a

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,310
personal message and she was like if

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,810
that's true congratulations I'm happy

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,640
for you but I wish that you'd felt

00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,080
comfortable sharing that with me and I

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,790
had no idea what she was talking about

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,790
and I went I opened the email and I read

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,250
it and I slammed my computer down and I

00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:24,690
stormed out of the room and I poured

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:26,730
some tea I was really mad I was really

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,740
upset I had a very emotional response

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,480
and it came in two big parts the first

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,010
one was that's the most sexist thing

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,420
I've ever heard in my life of course you

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:37,500
think I'm going on maternity the year

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm a woman um and I stormed around

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,290
ranting about that for a little while

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,840
and it was very upset and then I was

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:44,520
like oh it's because I've gained so much

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,140
weight and it's true I had gained a

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,520
significant amount of weight and I was

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,350
like maybe he thought I was freaking

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,580
because I've gained weight and then I

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,010
realized that I'd never met this person

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,410
face to face

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:59,140
because we work on the internet right

00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,640
and I was just nothing could really calm

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,050
me down but I did the hard work of

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,180
trying to calm myself down and

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,250
convincing myself that I had climbed out

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,860
of my feelings box and found a good calm

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:13,570
place and I sat down and he answered the

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:15,610
email and I let off a feminist rant the

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,820
likes of which no one has seen since

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,920
about how it's never acceptable to make

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,660
an assumption about everythin a woman

00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,090
would take time off work and how dare

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,340
you I earned my sabbatical just like

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,990
every man in my company and by the way

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,900
you're welcome to email this e-mail

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:35,440
address and someone will help you and I

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,850
took that with me on sabbatical I took

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,390
those feelings on sabbatical and then I

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,460
came back and I took this class and that

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,720
was the feedback that had stuck with me

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,270
the feedback that I had given because it

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,850
didn't feel right Oh still upset but

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,330
later on I kind of realized this poor

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,670
man didn't know me I have no idea why he

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,720
thought I was going on maternity leave

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,020
maybe he had me confused with someone

00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,630
else

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,340
maybe he heard me say that I was looking

00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,870
forward to spending time with my kid

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,240
when I was on my sabbatical I'm not

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,830
often specific about her age there are

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,930
any number of reasons it could have been

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,750
just an innocent mistake he just didn't

00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:13,980
know what a sabbatical was and the job

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,030
that I was trying to do turns out to be

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:21,010
let him know that he had reached the

00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:22,690
right email address that's what I needed

00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,060
to do who is going to be my contact

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,470
while kami is gone we don't know but you

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,910
have to send email to this email address

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:33,280
and I take that moment with me any time

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,950
I give feedback now and it seems simple

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,600
to say oh now every time I have to give

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,130
feedback I consider what job I'm trying

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,800
to do but it's something that I've

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:44,860
really tried to do mindfully in all

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,780
parts of my life and so I present to you

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,250
an example that I think most people can

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:54,480
relate to my kitchen is often very dirty

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:57,039
it is not my job to clean the kitchen

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,230
because I have a teenager and that is

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,890
wet and things that my teenager is good

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:05,380
for it is her job to clean the kitchen

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:07,330
but my kitchen is often not clean and in

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,030
the past the conversation has gone

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:14,620
something like this me the kitchen isn't

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:17,169
clean her okay me please clean the

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,940
kitchen her when I'm done with this

00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:24,400
video

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:28,390
do it now her massive nuclear scale

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:31,240
meltdown freak out you're so unfair

00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,710
what's wrong with you me why are you so

00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,330
amazing it doesn't want you to clean the

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,600
kitchen why can't you get it done I need

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:40,390
a gadget great and then like everyone's

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,190
rolling eyes and everyone's blown out of

00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:45,480
proportion and the feedback I was giving

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,659
my child is evaluation you have failed

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,000
to clean the kitchen that is your task

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,440
and now I kind of stop and I say kailia

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,400
will you please clean the kitchen

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,840
it isn't clean and we can all accept

00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,860
that this is feedback right this is

00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,450
feedback okay and she says when I'm done

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,720
watching this video she's watching

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,770
probably a game walkthrough on YouTube

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,059
or she's reading a book and trying to

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,820
change the world it's one of the two

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:14,919
with her and so I think please clean the

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,590
kitchen and she says when I'm done with

00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,570
this video and I want to freak out and

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,220
say why can't you just do the thing that

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,580
you know you're supposed to do I want it

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,020
done right now and then I stop and I say

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,880
kami what do you want to have done here

00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,679
do you want again if I would this person

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,900
or do you want the kitchen to be clean

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,990
the job that I would like done is to

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,929
have the kitchen clean and so I stop and

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,669
I say how long is that video and she

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:43,659
says something like three minutes and 27

00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:44,830
seconds mom and I stop and I say okay

00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,710
the job that needs to be done as the

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:50,620
kitchen needs to be clean Obama's not

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,150
coming over right there's no reason that

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,260
my kitchen needs to be clean in the next

00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:57,880
four minutes and so I say okay and I

00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,980
walk out of the room and no one rolls

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,230
there as anyone and miraculously usually

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,809
within half-an-hour she is in the

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,450
kitchen

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:09,590
it up and there may be some evaluation

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:12,559
there yeah there may be some evaluation

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,970
she doesn't wipe the counters still she

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,320
would prefer just to put dishes in the

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:20,539
dishwasher and not wash the pots and

00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:22,249
pans but it's still getting done I am

00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:23,690
getting the job done that I needs on and

00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:25,220
I'm giving her feedback that she can

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,080
accept because I'm doing it in a way

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,399
that she understands and appreciates

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,679
being respected

00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:35,779
so whatever the type of feedback were

00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:39,169
giving whether it is to our peer to our

00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:40,999
boss to someone that works for us to

00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:43,129
someone in the community to our child to

00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:45,769
our partner we should strive to give it

00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:47,840
in a way that respects the relationship

00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:51,740
we have with that person and that is

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,690
constructive and kind and when you are

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,090
giving feedback that is specific to a

00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,710
project or to a task or to a goal you

00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,200
should make sure to keep that feedback

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,850
about their project in no world has it

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,159
ever helped when I tell my teenage

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,899
daughter that she is lazy one of what I

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,330
want her to do is clean the kitchen that

00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:09,860
is personal feedback I need to give her

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:14,659
construction feedback the kitchen isn't

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:15,970
clean please clean it so please keep all

00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:19,279
of that in mind

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,080
now when feedback is delivered in anger

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,980
what happened when I told my daughter

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:28,639
all right all the things she responded

00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:31,669
negatively her receiving of the feedback

00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:34,009
was broken my giving of the feedback was

00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,740
broken so when we give heated feedback

00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:38,629
or angry feedback it creates a feedback

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,879
loop it creates kind of a vicious circle

00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:42,529
where someone is more likely to lash out

00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:44,480
and pretend they can't hear you or

00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:48,440
ignore the feedback that you're giving

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,119
as incomplete or incorrect if you give

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,559
someone angry feedback they can just

00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,340
blow it off they're like yeah I don't

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,190
like you either

00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:58,970
no this is fine if you give someone

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,440
concise feedback on topic hopefully it

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,720
is something that they will absorb when

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,480
I receive concise feedback about a topic

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,799
I am more likely to stop and rationally

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,610
think what job were they trying to do

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,139
there or how can I apply this even if I

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,480
don't think it's right how can I apply

00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:15,720
it

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,880
so when you are respectful and kind

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,830
people are less likely to block you on

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,420
Twitter and you were more likely to give

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,630
them good feedback and receive good

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,310
feedback from them in return because of

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,810
receiving feedback and receiving

00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:33,780
feedback well is the flip side of the

00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:35,070
coin for every feedback that is given we

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,230
also need to consider how the feedback

00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,330
is being received and we've touched on

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,790
that giving feedback in a way that the

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,310
other person can take sometimes you need

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,930
to express yourself someone will give

00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,850
you feedback in a specific way and it's

00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,440
not a way that you can hear sometimes

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,570
you need to say something sometimes I

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,760
hear feedback when I'm in a conversation

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,640
and I do much better when I receive

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,260
feedback in writing when I can see what

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,180
someone is saying when I can look at it

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,310
and take the emotion out of it and

00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,440
understand what job they are trying to

00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:07,440
do what feedback do I need and when I

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,690
can kind of absorb it on my own time not

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,870
everyone is like that so if you are in a

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,460
formal feedback situation it is always

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,990
appropriate to give the person giving

00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,910
you feedback feedback on how you'd like

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,380
to receive the feedback and the safe

00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:23,880
feedback for more times feedback

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,410
feedback feedback ultimately we had

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,000
control of our giving feedback but

00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,250
that's best control the strongest

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,430
control we have is how we receive

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:38,250
feedback and also what kind of feedback

00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:40,530
we receive this is where I tell you that

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,450
sometimes you don't read the comments it

00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,580
is absurd to have a hard and fast rule

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,890
about what one should and what should

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,570
not read more than half of modern

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,770
culture depends on what one shouldn't

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,720
read and I was having a great

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,610
conversation with a woman earlier today

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,650
about things she chooses not to read

00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,960
anymore because they make her stressed

00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:59,460
out they make her unhappy the feedback

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,110
this year I see you back there you're

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:06,450
hiding yes and and I feel very much the

00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,340
same way about news about feedback about

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,960
so many things when we bring in so much

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,970
negativity sometimes it's not something

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,190
that we can cope with anymore

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:17,460
and it's important not only to

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,290
understand what feedback you should

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,980
bring in but what feedback you shouldn't

00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,910
bring in so when you receive feedback

00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,460
make sure that you're being mindful of

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,320
yourself and your relationship with

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,820
feedback make sure that you are taking

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,500
care of yourself and make sure that if

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,140
if it's feedback you actually don't need

00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,600
to have that you distance yourself from

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:38,720
it and find a way not to receive it that

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,880
being said in most cases any feedback

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,559
even angry feedback is something that

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,600
can help you if it's an angry troll

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,390
incorrect feedback it helps you learn

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,190
how to ignore feedback if it's feedback

00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,710
that's angry but it has a core of truth

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,630
it helps you kind of understand Wow

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,600
something that I have said or done has

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,330
really significantly impacted another

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,830
person's emotional state and they feel

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,539
so deeply about it that they don't even

00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,159
know how to express that feedback to me

00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:06,529
doesn't mean that they have the right to

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,789
be angry with you it does mean that you

00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:12,440
can learn something from what they're

00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:13,820
saying but in most cases I do think we

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,399
should just avoid reading the comments

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:21,620
um that's my prepared feedback section I

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,210
would love to hear any questions or for

00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,350
anyone here to share their relationship

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,490
with feedback or thought about feedback

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,590
if they're interested in doing that

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:32,360
otherwise the economists Niq out to

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:34,940
lunch a few minutes early oh and here's

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,470
some phenomenal resources those two

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,470
books in particular are fantastic

00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:53,610
anybody questions comments desire to

00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:56,310
head to lunch I think the question

00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,080
I didn't want to end yeah I did have a

00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,600
question okay a lot of times our

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,170
feedback it's generally negative yes how

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,150
do you teach us to balance it out or so

00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,190
there's a big feedback thing there's a

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:10,590
thing I didn't talk about there's a the

00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:13,050
most common talk the most common type of

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,060
feedback coaching that people give is

00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:17,670
that it's the poop sandwich they be all

00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,830
heard of this form of feedback yeah so

00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:22,980
it is people will say you should always

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:27,720
buffer negative feedback with two

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:29,370
compliments I think this is the worst

00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,070
way that you can possibly give feedback

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,150
because it makes you be insincere with

00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,470
someone so you're not being honest

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,610
you're not being open you're not telling

00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,620
them anything that it's important for

00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,970
them to know and you're kind of

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,860
discounting the important thing that

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,430
they could really learn from so instead

00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,390
of spending your time thinking about two

00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,980
positive things so that we can

00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,110
counteract that generally negative

00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,500
feedback I find a way to make that

00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:54,120
feedback feel constructive but also it

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,710
is really important to me to be grateful

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,330
and thankful for the wonderful things

00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,860
that people do in my life so I try to

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,020
make a point of giving positive feedback

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,070
and I wish other people would too it

00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,090
doesn't have to be like oh you look

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,730
pretty today

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,440
that's a nice dress I mean it can

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:12,810
literally be anything you look like

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,010
you're in a great mood yeah you project

00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,880
I don't know why they put that

00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:20,580
microphone on you yeah just when when

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,250
someone when someone does something that

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,750
you appreciate don't as long as it's

00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,820
appropriate don't keep it to yourself I

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,500
mean where we ultimately are the people

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,050
who decide how much positive feedback

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:40,020
there is in our lives I sound like a

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:42,270
hippie I know it yes how do you give

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,010
feedback to someone if they do not want

00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:46,050
feedback if they've closed their

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,880
comments so in the social media age that

00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,790
is what we use Twitter for most of the

00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,710
time I mean if they closed comments if

00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,310
if you do not have access to that person

00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,920
in person

00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,300
you cannot email them you can't leave a

00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,360
comment and it's something important

00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,720
that they know I would go ahead and send

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,580
a kind DMI I understand the need for

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,340
calling people out with things but I

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,080
prefer to call in first and see if I can

00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:15,020
resolve the need to give feedback that

00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:17,540
way mm-hmm I notoriously will tweet it

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,610
companies when I'm not getting if I'm on

00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:23,090
hold for an hour and a half I tweet at

00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:24,890
them instead yeah this is perfect

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:26,930
because I was gonna suggest that if you

00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,560
get good help from a company like Bank

00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:32,750
of America or the IRS tweet it out yes

00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,450
I've done it before and I even got

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,190
response from Bank of America a direct

00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,450
message to find out who that person was

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,600
because they really wanted to thank them

00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:44,180
personally that's awesome I have been I

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,310
like I like shoes people I like shoes

00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,590
I'm not even gonna lie the Zappos has

00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,330
the best customer service and I love I

00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,190
love to say nice things about them so

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,920
yeah appreciate people appreciate

00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,970
companies and you know what appreciate

00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,520
the people that are close to you

00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,560
appreciate the people that you work with

00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,820
appreciate as if you appreciate someone

00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,640
please let them know I appreciate all of

00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,170
you you staff through my talk thank you

00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,000
so my question was actually going to be

00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,770
exactly that I'll let you be a hippy for

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,030
a second how do you express gratitude in

00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,650
your life and what is the appropriate

00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,990
amount not to sound like you're crazy

00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,600
okay so that one I kind of probably err

00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:21,110
on the side of crazy sometimes and I

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,620
admit that I try my best so in my

00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:28,220
personal life my partner is a very

00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:30,700
grumpy man he's very grumpy and very

00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,590
surly and everyone often wonders how

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:36,400
we've got like the Mary Poppins and then

00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:39,260
the old man in the sea grump situations

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,850
and people often wonder how that works

00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:45,350
out and I hope he's not watching the

00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:48,740
live stream but it's true and so I make

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:50,180
sure to tell him regularly well he is an

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,710
amazing cook and he cooks for me all the

00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,200
time and that is one of the way that he

00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,730
appreciates me he knows that I work hard

00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,860
and he knows that cooking is exhausting

00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,810
me he's appreciative of that he doesn't

00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,240
mind cooking he cooks for me and then I

00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:05,090
tell him how good it is I regularly

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,710
remind him that the work he's doing is

00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,630
really for the benefit of the community

00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,220
you kind of have to hone in there's like

00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,260
people talk about people having love

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,450
languages

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,520
giving people compliments and giving

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,440
people positive feedback can be a love

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,000
language with my daughter she needs to

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,280
hear that she's loved she needs to hear

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,960
that she is going to be okay she needs

00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,669
to hear that her generation can make the

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,710
future a better place same with her her

00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:29,030
friends I have a really close

00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,389
relationship with several of my

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:34,639
teenagers friends for some reason and I

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,919
appreciate them with work we have a kudo

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,740
system but we can only give three kudos

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:41,330
a month and so I make a point of like

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,590
popping notes and slapping someone on my

00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,409
team does something awesome I let them

00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:47,480
know when a checker at the grocery store

00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,280
is super nice to me and I didn't have to

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,740
self scan I tell them how nice they are

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,050
and you know how I appreciate that they

00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:57,020
smile every time I come in and I think

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,850
we just have to work hard to keep it

00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,170
relationally with like I was talking

00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,180
about having the relationship with the

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,740
person you can always get positive

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,480
feedback you know just give up Rishi

00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,650
ation as long as you're mindful of the

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,650
relationship you have with that person

00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:15,950
and I'm mindful of the fact that some

00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,020
food trucks are downstairs all right

00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:21,340
