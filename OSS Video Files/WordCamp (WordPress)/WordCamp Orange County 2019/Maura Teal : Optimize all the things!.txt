00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:14,670
hi morning everybody

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,640
how are we doing all right

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,430
so Steve mentioned my name is Maura teal

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,439
I am a software developer at a company

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,350
called Paige Lee we do managed WordPress

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,539
hosting I am also working on our new

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,640
platform called North stack which is

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,550
focused on a server less hosting

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,769
platform for WordPress and all other

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,030
sorts of sites so that's going to be

00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:39,600
really fun we're kind of getting into

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,100
the beta process now but I really look

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,360
forward to getting your feedback on it

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,149
when the day comes that I can let you

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:51,180
all into it so we're talking today about

00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:56,570
optimizing all the things now how many

00:00:51,180 --> 00:01:01,949
people here are site managers okay and

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:04,229
developers and none of the above okay

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,640
cool so we've got a pretty good mixture

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:12,060
here I gave this talk Yost Khan which is

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
an SEO conference so part of this is

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,380
going to start out more on the site

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,720
management level and then we'll get into

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,479
some more heavy development type of

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,830
concepts so I look forward to any of

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,270
your questions at the end I think we'll

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,700
maybe focus a little bit on the QA

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,900
depending on what type of questions come

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,170
up based on my presentation and with

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,439
that in mind let's talk about what we

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,950
are optimizing for who are optimizing

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,020
for why are we optimizing our sites

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,479
there are a lot of different answers to

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,490
this question today I'm going to focus

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,500
on bringing things to your attention

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,890
that you could pay attention to on your

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,189
site so not necessarily explicit

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,439
examples on do this a B and C because

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,409
every site is so unique and so different

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,180
everyone's use case is so different you

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,469
might only have management level you

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,020
might only be able to add or remove

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,320
plugins to your site or you might have

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,150
server level access to change your setup

00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,160
with that in mind I want to give you

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,650
some tools on different areas of your

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,490
site you can assess to improve your site

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,250
performance and optimize it and for

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,620
and foremost what we're optimizing for

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,980
what we're usually all at word cams for

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:33,120
is for business a lot of times we want

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:36,450
to increase revenue be that via ads via

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,940
views getting paid for articles that we

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,400
might write and want to post or

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,700
different restaurant reviews cat

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,950
pictures like we want to increase

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,630
revenue we want to get paid for our

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,890
sites we don't want to have to dump a

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,060
ton of money in and get nothing in

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,710
return and we want to retain users we

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,930
want people to go to our site not once

00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,210
but twice but three times we want them

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,390
to keep coming back we want to build

00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:05,610
trust with them we want people to click

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,740
on one page and then view the next in

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,200
the next and the next we want them to

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,730
build a rhythm of going on to our site

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,470
and staying there not just bouncing out

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,570
finally we want to stabilize our hosting

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,940
costs and this is something that early

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,430
on might be a little bit tougher to

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,140
think about if you have a smaller number

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,630
of users on your site if you have a

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,760
smaller number of visitors as you grow

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,740
your site performance becomes more

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,900
important because you're either going to

00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,760
improve the performance of your site or

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,220
you're going to pay more to throw

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,280
hardware at it and pay more in your

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,960
hosting costs so keeping in mind site

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,000
performance and optimization the whole

00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,910
way through is really important not just

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,550
for increasing revenue retaining users

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,260
but for stabilizing the costs that are

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,050
there that are hard costs you have to

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,460
pay for a server to host your site you

00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,700
might get away in the beginning with a

00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,710
$5 digitalocean server but down the line

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,750
as people start visiting your site as

00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,430
BOTS start crawling your site as your

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,710
site starts getting indexed by Google

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,940
and it becomes more popular you're going

00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,250
to have to think about that performance

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,900
because you need to be able to handle

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,100
serving that site up to more users so

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,640
that brings me to my next point

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,900
we're really optimizing for humans

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,400
that's what this whole talk is about

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:29,490
that's why we're here is our end user

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,960
isn't necessarily a robot if it is let's

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,729
talk later I'm curious as to what you're

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,330
doing but

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:40,059
generally we build our sites for humans

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:47,259
we want them to visit got a little ahead

00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:53,409
of myself let's see I wonder if I'm out

00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:55,629
of range there we go okay so with humans

00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:58,749
in mind we want to think about

00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:00,339
accessibility it's a weird thing to be

00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:02,289
saying oh yeah I want to optimize your

00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:03,279
site for performance I want your code to

00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,069
run better

00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,979
I want your site to be more accessible

00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,809
now that means that we're talking about

00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:13,930
the location of your site

00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:16,870
we've got servers all over the world

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,379
and your user base might just be here in

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,180
California when you've got to post your

00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:25,300
site on a server that lives in Virginia

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,639
and someone visits it from California

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,680
there's more time that it takes to

00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,189
transfer that data all the way from

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,749
Virginia to California so if you think

00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:37,990
about moving your site to a server

00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:39,099
that's closer to your user base you can

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,099
actually get a performance improvement

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:43,899
right there let's talking a little bit

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:46,330
about kind of the advanced level of it

00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:48,009
but additionally we're talking about

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,379
improving our site and improving the

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:52,629
performance for people who might be on

00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,879
limited data connections who might be

00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:57,069
utilizing an older device that is slow

00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,889
to be able to load stuff it might not

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:01,240
have gigabytes of memory to perform all

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,370
the JavaScript events that you want

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,529
performed to load all of those events

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,800
and play that auto playing video that

00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:11,020
might bog their machine down and when

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,979
you end up bogging someone's machine

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,879
down they lose trust in your website and

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,729
that brings me back to the business

00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,860
point you want to retain users and you

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:24,669
retain users by building their trust and

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:27,300
giving them interesting content so that

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:30,430
does kind of lead me to the next bit

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,919
which is what are we optimizing for we

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,110
are optimizing a little bit for search

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,370
we're going out there in the space world

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,020
the Google's know what we're up to and

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,569
search engines tend to crawl sites and

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,050
this is a lot of the time how we get new

00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:49,569
users these bots like I said maybe

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,699
you're not developing necessarily for

00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:54,550
humans you might be developing for

00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,949
Google's AI for Google's robots to crawl

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,330
your site and see it

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:02,199
Google ultimately leads you down the

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,759
path of getting users so we want to

00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,319
assess the performance because search

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,750
engines assess the performance of your

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,520
site search engines ultimately want your

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,180
site to be more accessible by humans

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,439
because that's their customer as well

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,719
something to keep in mind there as we go

00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:21,189
forward so where do we start well there

00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:24,009
are several tools that we're going to

00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:26,560
talk about today Google PageSpeed being

00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:29,740
one of them we might want to assess the

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,439
performance of our site and these are

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:36,969
some ways how so we've got some tools

00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:40,060
like GT metrics Kingdom excuse-me

00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:42,490
webpagetest.org all of these things

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,860
provide some metrics so basically you

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,229
visit the website you enter a URL in you

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,199
enter your home page in and you get data

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,899
back on how long it took to load how

00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,580
many assets there were how many assets

00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:59,020
we're slowing things down even more

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,879
causing confusion and delay perhaps it

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,979
should be noted though that only the

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,219
first three are free I believe GT

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:08,229
metrics has a paid option as well

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:11,469
and Pingdom is only paid they might have

00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:14,560
a free trial but Pingdom provide some

00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:16,689
additional information that you might

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,250
need later not later down the line so I

00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:21,639
might recommend it again later on in

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,919
this talk but essentially what you can

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,599
do is enter in your site there and I

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:31,000
have an additional note on those which

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:33,279
is the last three GT metrics webpagetest

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,209
and Pingdom allow you to choose a server

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,399
location to test from so again say your

00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:42,039
user base is in Canada right you live

00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,740
here in SoCal you might want to test the

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,100
site from a server closer to where your

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,470
end

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,050
your basis and you want to be able to

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,970
tell the testing service do your tests

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,130
all from this location

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,600
PageSpeed doesn't do that they're kind

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,980
of vague on on what you're getting but

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,250
it will still provide some really useful

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,889
insights I want to take a moment and

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:09,190
pause here and talk a little bit about

00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:10,899
the phrasing I'm using so what is

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,910
PageSpeed versus what is site speed

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,639
there are generally kind of used

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,139
interchangeably at least by me and what

00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,060
we're talking about when we're talking

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,100
about PageSpeed is that time to the

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,380
first byte that the page starts to load

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,529
and then the complete time one single

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,750
page on your site takes to load sites

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:32,259
feeding this one could probably surmise

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,240
would be the collective average page

00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:36,759
speed based on multiple pages on your

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,410
site so that overall concept of how long

00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:44,399
your site might take to load on average

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:47,649
so this is a screenshot from web page

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,199
webpagetest.org and those are some

00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:53,560
performance results and you'll see I've

00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:55,360
got an F up there that's just one of the

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,980
drawbacks of some of these services is

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,899
it doesn't always know what's going on

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,449
under the hood this is surface level

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,490
metrics of when your site loads and you

00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:06,100
can kind of see that diagonal line that

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,829
is the waterfall view of each asset

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,509
loading on the page so we're getting

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:14,319
some really interesting metrics and

00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:16,720
based on those metrics we can make some

00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:19,180
adjustments maybe to our site maybe we

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,420
can say oh man I have a giant header

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:25,959
image that's causing a really big gap in

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,990
that line in that waterfall do I really

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,430
need it or do I want to have people be

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,610
able to see my site sooner instead of

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,790
hindering what they're viewing and this

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,009
is a view from Google PageSpeed metrics

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,480
so again two free services that are

00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:42,550
pretty easy to use so you might as well

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,019
compare against both of them they'll

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,490
have slightly different suggestions

00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,949
based on what they think is most

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,439
important and if you go to Google

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:52,810
PageSpeed put in a website and scroll

00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:55,660
down a little bit specifically there's a

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,579
section called opportunities that lists

00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,939
out explicit things on your website that

00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,279
you could

00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:04,269
perhaps improve to improve your

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,459
performance and page speed so serve

00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,899
images perhaps in a different format all

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,079
of the images on my site I think are

00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:12,519
JPEGs because I'm too lazy to change

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,529
them over to WebP II and deal with

00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,449
supporting them and I've got some

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,939
cobbler shoe syndrome with never

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:22,329
updating my own personal website but

00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:24,909
using more modern image formats can

00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:26,199
greatly reduce that take the time it

00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:28,479
takes to load your site if your site is

00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:30,220
image heavy using those modern formats

00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,529
means smaller file sizes which means

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,099
that purport a person on a 3G connection

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:39,459
doesn't have to sit there as one image

00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:44,709
loads on the screen that might take half

00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:46,779
the time with modern web formats so

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:51,129
where do we start

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:53,879
where do we even go from here well I

00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:56,319
want to start on the server personally

00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,619
there's some interesting information out

00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:01,449
there about PHP versions explicitly

00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,279
there's been a big push

00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:07,869
recently in WordPress to bump the

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,899
minimum version from 5 to 25.6 where PHP

00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:13,720
is that underlying set of code that runs

00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,549
your WordPress site it's kind of an

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,769
important aspect of how a wordpress site

00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:24,099
runs if the primary aspect so PHP is

00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:26,919
important and even if you're like whoa I

00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:28,559
don't want to get into the code you

00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:31,299
should still have an understanding of

00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,609
what your site is running ask your web

00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:36,339
hosts they might have plans to help

00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:39,009
upgrade people it's always worth

00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:42,609
exploring because I believe it was like

00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:47,229
in 2015 we started prepping for the

00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:49,689
change from PHP 5 6 to PHP 7.0 that was

00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:52,089
coming out soon and Aaron Jordan

00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:56,379
actually did a lot of speed testing he's

00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:59,259
a core committer core contributor and in

00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:03,729
these speed tests he found that site

00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,199
speed improved like 50 percent or it

00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:09,699
doubled I'm sorry I'm not good with

00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:11,960
numbers but it doubled the speed and

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:14,510
performance of the site just

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,770
by upgrading the PHP version in there

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,480
weren't many drawbacks there are

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,730
especially not many drawbacks now

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,790
everyone says who I'm afraid to upgrade

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,680
I might get errors on my site everyone's

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,010
pretty prepared for it by now there

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,810
we're talking about metrics from 2015 so

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:34,820
there is no excuse for your site to

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:37,270
still be on a version of PHP 5 PHP 5.1 5

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:41,180
2 & 5 3 have all come out since then

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:43,760
PHP 7 isn't even supported anymore so

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:47,630
you should be running 7 1 7 2 something

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,510
at least up to that so there's no excuse

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:53,090
we're also working core is working on a

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,360
white screen Eliminator that will help

00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,740
deal with upgrades that might break your

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,950
site and give you that white screen of

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,780
death so there are many things going in

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,240
place to help encourage people to be

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,070
less afraid to update you should update

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,230
your site you should check your PHP

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:12,380
version because not only were there

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,330
speed improvements from 5 6 to 7 but

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,300
there were speed improvements from 7 to

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,760
7 1 and 7 1 2 7 2 that you can take

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,760
advantage of just by saying hey will you

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:28,930
update the PHP version on my server very

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:33,680
little work to do otherwise there we go

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:34,880
so nothing about the server let's go

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,090
back to front and land a little bit

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,520
again and talk about using a content

00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:43,280
delivery network remember earlier in my

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:47,180
talk I mentioned moving the server

00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:50,090
closer to your end-users moving that

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,220
information closer because if I have to

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,170
get information from here to the back of

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,120
the room it is going to take me longer

00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,820
than if I'm passing information between

00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,710
me and someone in the front row right

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,810
same concept with the computers you're

00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,150
increasing that time that it takes to

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,700
deliver information and there are some

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:10,250
wonderful free services out there like

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:15,320
cloud flare that can provide a CDN for

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:17,540
your site that can provide this giant

00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,600
network of servers that your information

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,800
goes out to and then they'll serve it

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,240
that can also cut some costs a little

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,300
bit because usually CD ends because they

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,310
distribute so much data they've worked

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,589
it out so that they can serve it for

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,600
cheaper then perhaps your host serving

00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:35,339
from there one data center that they own

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,980
and have to pay the electricity bill on

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,649
so it's something to keep in mind we've

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,160
got services like CloudFlare sakura

00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:48,779
offer something a CDN network fastly

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:52,200
Paige Lee uses the Amazon Cloud Front

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:54,810
service which provides that same Amazon

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,580
infrastructure but content distribution

00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:02,880
for not only your images and your assets

00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,459
but full page caching full page caching

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,020
is an interesting concept

00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,630
last year I was doing a whole talk just

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,180
on caching so I'm not gonna go too crazy

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,550
with it today but full page caching is

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,010
neat because what it does is it takes

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,800
the end result of something of a page

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,959
load takes all that HTML that PHP

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,580
renders from the backend on the server

00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,250
level and says okay we're gonna store

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:29,010
this tiny ol snippet of HTML that's

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:31,079
resulting information and serve it to a

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,720
bunch of users we're gonna reuse it

00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:36,420
so instead of having to slog through and

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,850
do a bunch of well if we're on this page

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,170
and we have this related content that we

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,350
need to couple together and ultimately

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,589
output an HTML page we skip all of that

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,360
processing time we reuse it so full page

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,300
caching is extremely useful especially

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,640
if you have a more static type of a site

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,790
a site that's meant to just deliver a

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,459
bunch of content that might not change

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,610
super frequently or isn't based on

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:04,410
logged in users logged in users tend to

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,660
need to see more dynamic things based on

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,550
the permissions they need to access so

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,410
you have to run PHP a lot of times to

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,770
assess what access they should get and

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:16,079
what they should be seeing there are

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,420
ways around that as well but there are a

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,189
couple of CD ends that offer this full

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,280
page caching CloudFlare is again one of

00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,929
them so is Amazon CloudFront

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,510
just naming a few if you google it

00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:30,210
you'll get a ton of information and then

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:34,770
we've got WordPress plugins like w3

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,630
total cache WP super cache WP rockets

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,130
there are so many out there that I

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,440
haven't even kept up with that are

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,480
really

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,240
wonderful and available to you for free

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,720
so it's always something to keep in mind

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:50,019
with but you also have to keep in mind

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,830
that ecommerce does not necessarily fall

00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:55,450
into this bucket of cash all the things

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,159
because people need to have dynamically

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,370
loading pages they need to be able to

00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,110
add things to their cart see live

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,230
updates perhaps on what you have in

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,610
stock so e-commerce especially when

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,649
we're talking about taking payments is

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,809
not something that I want to go with

00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:13,960
full page caching for I might want to

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:16,450
cash chunks of information but once

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,009
you're at that level there are gonna be

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,389
more more options out there you just

00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:23,529
have to dig a little bit deeper and get

00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:25,570
a little bit more advanced so let's talk

00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:29,259
about image optimization what's out

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,700
there as I mentioned earlier image

00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:33,100
optimization is something that's

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,889
incredibly important that's something

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,960
that showed up on my screenshot earlier

00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:40,299
I know it was pretty small but it showed

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,159
up on my screen shot earlier of my own

00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,009
personal site because I'm not using

00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,259
formats that are super modern for my

00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:49,480
images there are new image formats out

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:52,539
there like web P that might be better

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,039
suited for images that you need to serve

00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:56,289
out to a ton of people that are larger

00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,330
perhaps or perhaps you shouldn't even be

00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:00,190
serving an image at all perhaps if it's

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,399
something very simple you should be

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,039
serving up an SVG which is drawing

00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:08,710
essentially on the page that the browser

00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:11,350
can render instead of having to parse

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,529
out pixels on its own from an image like

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,710
a gift for a ping these are all things

00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,730
that we kind of taken into account and

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,220
when we're talking about image

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:24,129
optimization sorry another thing I want

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,139
to mention about image optimization is

00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:28,629
that you should be using something to

00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,860
compress your images we're not just

00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:31,659
talking about format so when we talk

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,000
about image optimization we're talking

00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:36,370
about compression because there's a lot

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,110
of extra data that goes along with your

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,360
images when you shoot them on say your

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,100
phone you might have location data you

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,399
might have author data there might be

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,279
extra information about what's in the

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:50,049
shadows perhaps your camera captures so

00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,360
much that our naked eyes don't even

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,580
always see and when you're

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,350
posting images on the web we don't need

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,790
to post all of that extra information

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,290
that just blows the file size so instead

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,170
we put them through compression em

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:11,400
engine engines we put them through there

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:14,080
are some services like WP smush i.e www

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,940
there is a service called cloud Andheri

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,980
some of these will work directly on your

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,080
server and some of these will send your

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,030
image over to a secondary server to

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,150
their own servers and run them through

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,400
and process them to better squish them

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,049
and compress them without losing too

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,730
much quality because sometimes you can

00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:34,210
get pixelation if you say okay I want to

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,980
compress the heck out of this so look

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,470
into those services especially if you

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,720
are doing a photographer's website

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,419
perhaps because that's where you're

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,770
going to see the most savings is serving

00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:47,350
up images that have been properly

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,799
compressed that are properly sized for a

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:53,429
user's device there's no reason I should

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,980
be sending out a 2,000 pixel wide image

00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:59,140
to someone on an older iPhone for

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,179
example that thing's not going to show

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,620
up very well and it's just gonna take

00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:06,520
forever to download and it's just gonna

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,559
piss off my end user so I'm going to

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,220
make sure to compress and thoughtfully

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,179
manage those images so you saw a little

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,160
preview of this already

00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:17,140
let's talk assets we're still in

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,390
front-end land right so we've got a

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,130
bunch of assets that load on a website

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,130
when someone hits our page

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:28,179
we've got CSS we've got JavaScript we've

00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,980
got all of those images and we want

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:33,730
optimize for that by limiting those

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:36,640
frivolous scripts WordPress plugins get

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,440
dicey with this say you have 50 plugins

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,270
and everyone says oh well isn't that bad

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,910
for your site isn't that gonna slow it

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,710
down well yeah if each plug-in is

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,900
loading 10 scripts on every single page

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:50,559
even though that plugins widget doesn't

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,480
show up on every single page so it is

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,160
something to consider each plugin might

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,169
come with its own little snippet of CSS

00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,900
that's something that we can concatenate

00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:02,080
into one bigger file if we're clever

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,960
with our development and engineering so

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,210
image optimization is important or asset

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,330
optimization I'm sorry is

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,640
importance we can also do something to

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,460
compress those external assets called

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,800
minification a lot of javascript files

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,110
and CSS files have a lot of white space

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,420
in them as developers we like our code

00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,370
organized but the machines don't care

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,040
the machines could care less that there

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:30,000
is nice indenting in white spaces and

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:32,010
really verbose variable names so say

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,590
you've got JavaScript file if you run it

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,420
through minification we can adjust some

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,780
of the variable names that perhaps

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:42,750
aren't used elsewhere so the variable

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,780
names go from my special variable to a

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,210
and B and C for example and cut out

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,550
extra bytes so the end user doesn't have

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,440
to load unnecessary bytes just for their

00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,470
machine to be able to process an output

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,740
what we want it to do so we turn out all

00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:01,290
of that whitespace and some of this is

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:04,560
kind of starting to get into the nickels

00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,900
and dimes of things perhaps you want to

00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,070
make sure your site is finely tuned and

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,560
running as well as possible this is

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,630
where we get into the minification and

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,520
this is usually something that Google

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,070
PageSpeed will recommend if you haven't

00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,530
done it already so keep that in mind

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,900
there are a lot of times big things we

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,670
can do this to me tends to be a smaller

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,740
thing but a very important thing that

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:31,530
you might as well check the box off and

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:34,890
do this asset optimization so where do

00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:38,040
we go from there we've got our PageSpeed

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:40,500
metrics we've got our information from

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,780
webpagetest.org how do we assess that

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,150
data well I would recommend utilizing

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,130
the chrome developer tools Firefox also

00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,350
has a great set of developer tools and

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,120
even if you're not a developer it is

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,160
safe to go in and look at these tools

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,130
and play with them they're not going to

00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,020
edit your actual site what you'll want

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:00,530
to do is right-click perhaps on an

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,930
element or go up from the file menu and

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:06,720
do inspect elements there's a keyboard

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:10,170
shortcut but off the top of my head I'm

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,440
forgetting I think it's all command I

00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:15,270
shift command I something like that and

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,890
you'll see this bar pop up either in the

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,440
bottom or the side of your screen that

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,930
has a bunch of little headers it'll show

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,230
you

00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:25,570
all of the HTML the Dom elements that

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,330
are of the that are in the site and then

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,860
you have these great two tabs that I

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,870
basically live in when I have to assess

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,300
things on the front-end called network

00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:37,000
and performance and that network tab

00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,700
provides this beautiful waterfall so if

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,460
you hit reload on a page you're going to

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,010
see each asset pop up there as your

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,600
server is requested as the browser says

00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,040
hey I need this image can you start

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,420
downloading it you'll see a nice little

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,550
bar that says the time it took to

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,950
request it from the server and then the

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,540
time it took to complete the download

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:59,410
you'll see that cascade as the entire

00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,460
page loads it's pretty wonderful if you

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,530
want to get into some of the

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,920
nitty-gritty or perhaps you're saying

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:08,230
okay well I minified all my scripts and

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,920
I tried to serve up all the best images

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:14,200
I could what is taking everything what's

00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,580
taking such a long time to load I can't

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,080
figure it out I sit there I stare at the

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,630
page and it just sits there

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,120
it takes three seconds and then finally

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,340
starts loading using this network tab

00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,980
will show you those pauses those hanging

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,250
points perhaps there's a script that is

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,560
being told to run synchronously it's

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,160
what we call a render blocking script up

00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,590
in the head of the site this script

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,660
tells your browser okay this I want

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,690
loaded and you can't be loading anything

00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,520
else during this time again it causes

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,410
some confusion and delay potentially

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,150
there might be some sort of reason why

00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:53,530
the developer said load this

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,820
synchronously not asynchronously so we

00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,840
always want to be careful with if we're

00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,190
modifying that but again as a developer

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,780
I want to know these things I want to be

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,630
able to assess them in using the chrome

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,300
developer tools is generally how I go

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,220
about that let's talk a little bit more

00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,540
on the Advanced Mode we're starting to

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,770
get into server stuff we're starting to

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:17,770
get a little nitty-gritty here

00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:20,950
so not all sequel calls are the same and

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,930
I kind of want to start with that so we

00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,840
have our WordPress setup it's based on

00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:29,080
this my sequel database and we make

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,060
queries to that database those queries

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,530
are calling for posts they're calling

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,160
for related posts they're calling for

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,950
tag

00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,870
they're calling four categories they're

00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:41,440
calling for meta that's additionally

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:44,680
related to a post and we're doing all of

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,290
these as PHP runs and say you have a lot

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,910
of logged in users on your site in the

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,650
administrative area there are usually

00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,530
even more queries that we end up doing

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:56,830
against our database so we want to

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,870
assess what's going on we want to assess

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,490
how many queries are happening and

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,770
there's a great plugin by John black

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:06,070
Bourne called query monitor it's a free

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:08,470
plugin on wordpress.org and this free

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,630
plugin allows you to see what plugins

00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:14,170
are querying what things from the peda

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:16,360
base that's wonderful because you can

00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,250
say oh I just added this plug-in I don't

00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,650
know what's going on with it my site

00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,850
slowed way down when you're logged into

00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,060
the site and you're looking at this

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,070
query monitor plug-in you can say oh

00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,800
that's querying for all of the users and

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,200
I have thousands of them I only need one

00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,420
person how do I pull that that out maybe

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,090
you need to catch the results from the

00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,360
database maybe you don't need to combine

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:42,190
all of that information a lot of times

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,860
getting into managing sequel queries

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:47,230
comes if we have control over our code

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,780
base so it's much harder to manage from

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,130
the third-party plugin aspect but it's

00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,470
also wonderful that we work in an

00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:56,260
open-source community and therefore a

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:58,570
lot of times as a developer if I find a

00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,360
query that runs super slow because I'm

00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,550
managing a large website and I found

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,900
this out the hard way I can actually

00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:07,090
make a pull request I can make code

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,890
suggestions to other people managing

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,660
other plugins and we can all work

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,540
together to improve the performance of

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,750
the Internet so not all queries are

00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:20,680
created equal TLDR you should check into

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:23,680
that but you should also use indexes so

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:28,750
post meta is this funny table of

00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:31,480
information and it all has its own

00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,790
unique index with a key for every single

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,060
post meta item and then it also has the

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,980
exact post that it relates to so we've

00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:42,090
seen a lot of performance challenges

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,410
with very large sites at page Lee where

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,130
someone's querying perhaps for a lot of

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,210
post meta or

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:51,640
a lot of related tags or categories and

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:54,220
adding an index to that table adding

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,950
telling my sequel okay not only is this

00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,380
one index column important but this

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,630
other one is too you should take your

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,520
time and go through that data and be

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,250
able to query against this column as

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,460
well improves performance sometimes

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:11,380
tenfold against specific queries so not

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,090
only are your queries important and you

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,470
should assess them but you should also

00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,320
consider what tools you have

00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,450
if you can't modify the queries

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,440
themselves you might be able to make a

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:26,260
modification on the explicit table these

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,720
are kind of digging deeper so we're

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,120
getting into the server right so we've

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,530
got the server level stuff this is just

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,910
something I want to I want to go pretty

00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:38,980
quickly over so we have a little bit of

00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:41,080
QA time but essentially excuse me we've

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,490
got a Linux setup that's the most common

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,430
setup we have for a WordPress website

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:48,570
and it might be running Apache or nginx

00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:51,640
to route the traffic within your server

00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:53,680
my favorite is generally just nginx only

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,150
you could have a combination of Apache

00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,830
nginx you could be utilizing any sort of

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,540
setup but that's generally my favorite

00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,190
there's an additional there's a newer

00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,110
product called nginx unit that were

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,920
utilizing on your stack but I'm pretty

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,750
excited about but your server setup is

00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,870
something you could assess generally and

00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:16,150
a next to me is considered faster but it

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,890
also depends on what type of redirection

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,340
you have set up you've got that htaccess

00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:23,710
file perhaps doing specific routing that

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,720
might be slowing things down I want you

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,150
to consider the performance of your

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,760
server setup itself if you if you can if

00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,170
you can dig that far you might end up

00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,120
down in this crazy rabbit hole of like

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,370
this is the best setup I've ever I've

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,640
ever messed with or maybe tweaking this

00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:43,150
one thing makes all of my pages load 300

00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,340
milliseconds faster there's a lot we can

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,690
kind of do with that and finally I've

00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,460
already harped on this a little bit but

00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:52,360
the physical location of the server

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:56,260
could be useful it's a little tough in

00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,180
California to be honest at least I only

00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,930
work with the Amazon services but I know

00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,330
that the

00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,980
West Coast generally has higher server

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,610
cost than say if you want to host your

00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:09,040
website in Ohio so it's kind of this

00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,690
cost versus performance balance again we

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,830
want to deal with hosting costs as best

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,810
we can but perhaps if you have a lot of

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,820
traffic that's all in San Francisco it's

00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:22,000
worth paying the premium price to host

00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,170
your site on servers in San Francisco it

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,750
makes you look better it makes your

00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,580
client look better it keeps people on

00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,560
your site because things might load just

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,140
a little bit faster so they're not as

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,460
quick to quickly click away

00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:37,390
but location is always something we can

00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:40,000
kind of assess and check on and to do

00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,730
some of this server level assessments

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,180
I'm going to give you a couple of tools

00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:47,680
my absolute favorite is New Relic is

00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:50,680
generally considered this paid

00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,660
enterprise type level tool a lot of

00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,240
hosts will install it for you if you ask

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,240
them to and pay for your own account on

00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,910
it but something I recently discovered

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,130
is a service called data dog it seems

00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,050
like it could give you similar metrics

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,640
essentially what it does is it watches

00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,710
all of the queries all of the server

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,620
level information all of your my sequel

00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,700
queries on your WordPress installation

00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,740
it gives you feedback it gives you

00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,600
numbers it says this is slow these are

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,030
all errors or warnings that are getting

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,300
thrown and lets you keep an eye on that

00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,950
and it keeps all of that information in

00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,950
its own database so that you actually

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,600
have metrics over time you say ok this

00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,730
is the day I installed that plug-in or

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,510
this is the day I updated that code and

00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,770
can actually see the physical changes on

00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,390
when someone visits your site how long

00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,330
does it take to load a specific page

00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:42,550
even you can drill down so add out a dog

00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:45,250
does have WordPress specific

00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:48,760
integrations which I like and it should

00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:50,020
be cheaper than New Relic I don't want a

00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,610
hundred because I vouch for it but I do

00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,780
want to suggest you maybe look at it if

00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,250
you've looked at New Relic and thought

00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,290
yeah that's a little too expensive for

00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,210
me right now additionally I want to

00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,160
mention grow fauna core fauna is

00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,860
something that we utilize a lot at work

00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,500
and grow fauna is a tool that lets you

00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:08,110
see other server level metrics it takes

00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,180
a lot more advanced setup and you can

00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,179
explicitly filter based on different

00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,490
queries you can look at PHP

00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:16,320
workers and the performance of those you

00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,210
can perhaps look at your WordPress cron

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,299
jobs and see if something's taking over

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,950
and causing the server to hang it

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,259
provides a lot of interesting tools and

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,570
it's a free open-source option if you're

00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:29,429
really into server level information and

00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:33,450
metrics so I want to make sure to

00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:35,580
mention that and along those lines once

00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,230
we get into this advanced notice scaling

00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,970
I'm going to gloss over this a little

00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,799
bit because I want to make sure I have a

00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:43,259
little bit of time at the end but

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,509
essentially there's scaling that you can

00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:48,179
do when it comes to a WordPress once you

00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:50,549
get to a certain size you might be

00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,230
taking in hundreds of thousands of

00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:54,179
visitors say you are running an

00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,970
e-commerce site you might have a black

00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,070
friday sale and your site needs to scale

00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,169
it needs to grow it perhaps needs to

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,809
have its code running on more than one

00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:06,749
server so that you can route traffic and

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:10,169
deal with with processing everyone's

00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:12,899
visits so we've got horizontal and

00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:14,760
vertical growth we could potentially run

00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,369
our database also on two servers if

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,530
there are a lot of queries against it

00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:22,710
generally I don't advise this it's a

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,599
it's a dicey setup in some cases but you

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,429
could have two servers running to two

00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,169
copies of the same database where you

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,379
only write to one and then duplicate the

00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:33,359
data over generally I focus on running

00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:35,280
the PHP and getting the performance out

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,329
of that with running multiple servers

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,679
and directing traffic there so I wanted

00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:42,000
to make sure to mention there are there

00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,609
are lots of things you can do with

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,379
hardware and set ups but again you

00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:49,530
should have checked all of your boxes on

00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:50,909
is your PHP even performing well you can

00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,909
assess that with query monitor you can

00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:56,190
assess that with New Relic you can

00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:59,220
assess that just even watching the times

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:01,890
go by in your browser as you attempt to

00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:04,890
hit a page you can also assess it with

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,780
unit testing and that's a whole nother

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,980
talk in itself too so I won't go too far

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,230
but I'm going to say the word unit

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,480
testing I hope that the developers in

00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,640
the audience remember that

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,559
and finally when I'm talking about

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,440
scaling and when I am talking about

00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,930
server location I should talk about

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,910
performance versus reliability because

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,890
all of us want our sites to load quick

00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,779
we all want our sights to perform the

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,910
best we all want people to hit our sight

00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:32,680
and be like wow that was that was fast I

00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,920
you know I didn't even have to sit there

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,359
and wait it just boom was right there

00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,109
but there's a little bit of stability we

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,789
should talk about there is this concept

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:45,250
of horizontal scaling and there's a

00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:49,150
concept of keeping your database on the

00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:50,829
same server as your site itself again

00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,789
don't forget your site needs to talk to

00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:53,529
your database so there's some

00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:55,509
milliseconds of delay right as this

00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:57,490
communication happens and if you move

00:35:55,509 --> 00:36:00,400
your database off to its own server it

00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:02,500
has more resources to exclusive to

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,119
perform its own operations but then

00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,680
there's more latency there's more time

00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:09,220
in between that those two things need to

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,880
talk to each other that is considered

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,470
bad for performance you could say but it

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,059
creates a sense of stability if

00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,920
something were to happen to the PHP

00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:20,410
server to the site that's serving up the

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,329
code itself if something bad were to

00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,769
happen your database would still be

00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:25,450
intact and that's all of your

00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:28,000
information that's your users that's

00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:30,940
your sales that might be additional

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,099
metrics that's all of your content so we

00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,930
we have this dynamic of performance

00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:38,559
versus reliability that I wanted to make

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:40,839
sure to mention and share we've also got

00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,950
a concept of premature optimization but

00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:43,799
I'm not even going to cover today

00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:46,660
because I'm running a bit out of time

00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:48,700
but you should be optimizing your code

00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,259
and commenting your code sometimes

00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,609
you're optimizing your workflow more

00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:56,230
than you're optimizing it for the

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:58,539
end-user so what else do you do monitor

00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,400
the performance this is where I'm going

00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:02,140
to bring up Pingdom again remember

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,849
that's that paid service it will

00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,980
actually monitor the performance of your

00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,690
website which is a pretty wonderful

00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,609
thing you can go there and have

00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:12,160
historical data on how your site's been

00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:13,599
performing DT metrics will provide some

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,609
of this monitoring for you as well I

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,109
believe that's a paid service but they

00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:20,259
might have some free tier stuff in there

00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,910
as well in consider third-party scripts

00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:23,529
consider add scripts that you might be

00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,660
running analytics scripts that you might

00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:28,960
be running all of these can impact the

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,670
performance of your website so now I

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,980
want to give a little bit of time for

00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:36,369
questions I don't want to surprise you

00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:38,619
too much but maybe hopefully we have we

00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:44,619
have two minutes if it has

00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:47,380
anything in mind questions we did scare

00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:52,240
you okay

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:53,619
as far as optimizing images obviously

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,079
the the trend and the big thing is to

00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:57,640
have it specially portfolio sites or

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,430
anything else doesn't have hero images

00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:04,150
I'm sorry I can't can here oh sure god

00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:06,640
he wrote images you know they're they're

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,799
big they're colorful they're there you

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,019
want them sharp and your portfolio you

00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:14,140
want a sharp well that makes a weighty

00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:16,990
picture no matter what you do and so I

00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,779
don't know if there's a magical number

00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:22,059
of kilobytes that you just go no you

00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:23,650
just can't go over that or not or if

00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:26,079
it's just you just got to get as low as

00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:30,069
you can and forget about it and you know

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,930
not sweat it so so I did get that uh so

00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:34,029
the question was as far as image

00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:36,099
optimization is there some sort of magic

00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:37,869
number of kilobytes say you've got some

00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:39,400
big hero images some header images you

00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:41,980
want them crisp and clean you want them

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,440
to look high quality is there something

00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,960
that we're specifically striving for and

00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,849
I would say no absolutely not

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,559
there's this kind of gut feeling that I

00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:52,239
go with like this is what I could live

00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,279
with and actually in your chrome

00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,019
developer tools if you want to test out

00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:58,150
someone who might be visiting your site

00:38:56,019 --> 00:39:00,069
what it looks like for someone visiting

00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,749
your site on a slower speed it has an

00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:03,730
option to toggle your speed and throttle

00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:06,430
it so you can experience the site like

00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,960
someone else might so it's all it's all

00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,999
thresholds that we kind of set for

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,400
ourselves and I would also recommend

00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:15,460
having alternative image crops or sizes

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,349
that display on different devices so

00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,539
there's no reason like you might have

00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:21,220
one image size that shows up on a big

00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:23,170
desktop monitor but there's no reason to

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,480
serve that same image to someone on

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:29,099
their mobile phone that's how from one

00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,099
more question over here

00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:40,470
so in your experience with regard to

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:45,720
optimization what is your trigger point

00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:51,100
or time to first byte and time or

00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:53,170
homepage full delivery okay so what is

00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,630
my trigger point what's my what's my

00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:57,850
time between time to first byte to full

00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:02,410
page delivery and frankly I don't have

00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:05,980
one I didn't even get into it in this

00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:08,650
talk but managing DNS and having fast

00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:12,910
DNS resolution times are extremely

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,650
important so I would consider it's all

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,200
in what you think is a good threshold I

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,530
would run off of what PageSpeed even

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,070
tells me anything over like 300

00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:27,120
milliseconds feels excessive extremely

00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:29,230
excessive for that time the first bite

00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,720
but frankly I haven't been doing

00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,570
front-end development lately so I don't

00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,540
have specific thresholds at the moment

00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:40,290
we can chat later though all right give

00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,290
it up for more up

00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,489
