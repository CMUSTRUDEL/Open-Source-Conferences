just by a show of hands I started fans

00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:19,150
who's been a gen born word can't talk in

00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:22,539
the past alright and so I I first met

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:26,470
Jan or saw gen add a word can't talk and

00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:28,179
I was immediately blown away and I said

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,720
this is this is my people

00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:34,030
and so you know we knew right then we

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,420
needed a meet we became friends we

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,520
became we became collaborators on on

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,660
projects we've been in a mastermind

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,129
group together we shared ideas we are

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,699
simpatico

00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:50,500
and so I really do have a true respect

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,840
for what Jenn does what she's

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,690
accomplished in her business what she's

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,309
done over the years and so I'm gonna

00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,989
turn things over to Jen to talk about

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,780
sometimes that you maybe sometimes that

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:07,090
you have failed in business and what

00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,060
your takeaways were so that we can all

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:13,119
learn from that welcome thank you you're

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,040
welcome so I'm just gonna come up and

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm just gonna list my failures yeah

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,680
okay there's so many so one of the

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,270
things I think one of the four I list

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,640
some some failures I think one of the

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,740
things I think is interesting um a few

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,170
years back I have this weird things

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,380
start happening where I was would speak

00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,149
at an event or I'd be in an event and

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,439
during Q&A or sometimes afterwards

00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,729
somebody would come up and say can you

00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,060
just tell me about something you do

00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,909
terrible terrible yeah can you tell me

00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,649
something you're terrible at and I had

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:51,460
it happen in Q&A can you just talk about

00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:53,140
some stuff you're terrible huh and then

00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,329
I'm like this is really weird and it

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,790
happened three or four times and then it

00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,200
started happening on social media and I

00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,509
will post something and somebody be like

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,100
that's great but can you touch it what

00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:05,979
are you terrible at I want to know what

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,630
you're terrible at and here's the thing

00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:10,210
that you need to know about me I'm good

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,270
at a lot of stuff but I'm not great at

00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:16,780
anything right like you can like you're

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,210
good at a lot of things but I think both

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,820
the people that are truly

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,440
spectacular in one area like I don't I

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,890
don't resonate with that at all I'm like

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm good at a lot of stuff so I think it

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,190
was an interesting thing and I say why

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,660
does everybody want to know how much I

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,980
suck at stuff and I have this

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,510
conversation with someone they're like

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,160
yes but on you know you've probably

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,840
heard the thing like social media is the

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,060
highlight reel right you see everybody's

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,340
successes and of course I'm gonna post

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,810
food that I make that's awesome I'm not

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,640
gonna post the waffle thing that we

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,410
tried that came out so crappy I had

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,480
turned my waffle iron upside down and

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,820
like shoo water and like scrape

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,590
everything else's it was horrid and if

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,320
we beta's wanna puke like I'm not

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,760
sharing that um so you don't share all

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,160
the terrible things you're only sharing

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,840
you know the good things what I found is

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,200
you know I'm I'm not thinking about

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,090
sharing all the bad because that's not I

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,320
mean yeah you don't share your dirty

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,400
laundry I'm like I don't share all that

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,290
bad stuff but that's what people who

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,940
were aware of what I was doing

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,680
we're like I just want to know that

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,830
you're badass like I just want to know

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,780
like where do you fail and so I love the

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,490
idea of talking about failures here

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,880
because so many times you never talk

00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,890
about the fact that um while I have a

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,800
good reputation of customer service and

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:42,270
client management I have lost it

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:45,650
on a client what like that so bad Brian

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,650
like comes in the office and he's like

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,390
he's like horrified and I'm just keep

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,150
going it was so bad um but they saved my

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,740
clients so yeah but it was so bad right

00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,910
nobody taught you not nobody talks about

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,700
those things

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,710
Nathan shared that he lost a huge

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,080
portion of his income in one day that's

00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,940
happened to me like four times but we

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,670
don't go on social and it's like my

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,040
biggest client just quit today I'm not

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,049
sure how I'm gonna fill that in great

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,250
let's hustle like those aren't the

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,640
things that you're talking about or

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,430
sharing sure or the bad business

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,060
decisions that you make like I I did a

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,790
deal with the county that I live in were

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,169
a huge farm-to-fork area in Northern

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,770
California and I did a deal with the

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,479
county they

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,300
came to me and they're like we want to

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,340
be able to provide websites to all our

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,740
local farmers that don't have an online

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,970
presence

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:47,400
yeah and we negotiated this deal and I

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,590
was earlier on in my business and I

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,300
wasn't super savvy and I didn't have a

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,909
mastermind and I didn't really have

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,210
people I could turn to and I did the

00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:57,840
deal and it was the worst thing I've

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,370
ever done

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,740
ever and and it was it was horrible

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,270
so but those are things I'm gonna go

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,430
talk about because I'm not gonna go talk

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,569
about my clients badly you know you

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,039
don't you don't go air your dirty

00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,960
laundry and your business and go talk

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,909
about your clients badly so we don't

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,680
share those kinds of things or the days

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,930
where you're like I build this business

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,419
I hate it and I want to quit you know I

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,819
don't post on social that I told Brian I

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:26,099
hate the business that I built like go I

00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,340
like I quit go find another designer I

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:30,840
don't even want to do this anymore

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,919
because what if a client saw that and

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,840
they're like ooh maybe we should hire

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,280
somebody else right those are all the

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,979
things that we keep and we don't talk

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,710
about but everybody goes through it

00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,639
and so when you and you were talking

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:46,680
about what today we're talking about

00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,880
failure I was like about that but then I

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,710
was like but it's something important

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,880
that we have to talk about because

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,169
everybody goes through it and when

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,759
you're going through it oftentimes you

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,069
think then the only person this is

00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,090
happening to or maybe you don't have

00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:02,310
people to talk to in the really really

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,110
early years of my business um when I

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,550
started freely it like when I started

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,139
freelancing it wasn't my idea it was

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,779
Brian's he's like don't people that you

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,880
do what you do do it at home like I'm

00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,169
doing all the kids stuff and I was

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,560
pregnant and he's like I don't want to

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:18,330
do all the kids stuff for two kids like

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,159
can't you quit and just work at home and

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,080
I was like yeah probably in the next

00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,880
days like I got you business license and

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,509
I figured out a business name and I

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,330
filed it all so this is happening but I

00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:32,219
didn't know anybody who freelanced I

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,479
didn't I didn't know anybody who

00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:34,800
freelanced I didn't know anybody that

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,380
worked at home I didn't know anybody

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,110
that owned a business let alone anybody

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,270
that did that that had a home that had a

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,920
two-year-old and was pregnant or had a

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,390
baby and so I was

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,160
really alone and then I found this

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,250
woman's networking organization and I

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,140
joined it and my business was taking off

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,420
but I didn't know how to do business and

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,340
I was under charging and so I was

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,810
charging a lot really really little but

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,780
I was doing a lot of work and I was

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,480
working 16 17 18 hour days seven days a

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,760
week every day and I was drowning but my

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,640
business was great on the outside like I

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,100
was making a ton of money but I was

00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,710
dying and I go to these events and I

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,480
talked to my friends at these events who

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,610
are other women business owners where

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm looking for support and they're like

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,710
how are things going and I'm like well

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,680
my business is amazing but like I I have

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,410
too much business or like I'm not like

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,850
if I take less like I I need this to pay

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,010
my mortgage but like I'm not I'm not

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,260
sure how to handle what's going on and

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,470
they say oh gee we wish we had your

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,350
problems shut up great like they just

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,900
were like oh like there was no one to

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,660
turn to at the time right and I think a

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,000
lot of people get stuck in that spa at

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,580
some point in your business right so

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,650

support system mm-hmm right you talk

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,860
about burnout you talk about being alone

00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,690
or feeling alone right and so and you

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,550
went and you sought out a support system

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:33,030
ultimately what became your support

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:38,260
system that is a really good question I

00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:40,780
pay so the very first place I looked for

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,900
a support system I paid a crap ton of

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,210
money to join an online mastermind

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,720
program facilitated by a business coach

00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:53,560
okay a really really well-known one but

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,280
it was a multiple five figure like it

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,870
was it was expensive okay um I think the

00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,520
first one I did it was 30

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,560
and and I look I was so desperate to

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,910
have somebody I could get support from

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,920
or a community or a group to have

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,360
support from I was like yes let me give

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,950
you your money and she promised all the

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:19,180
things and it was terrible worst loss

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,830
ever most painful loss we did do you

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,150
have I had ended up getting half my

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,010
money back but that was a fifteen

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,670
thousand dollar loss sure but I was so

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,500
desperate for that right and I still

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:33,160
believe in that process so I did it

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,020
again but with somebody else still a big

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,350
still a big investment in that one was a

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:42,010
huge success for me okay I found women

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:44,230
who owned businesses and had kids and I

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,460
found people who were doing the exact

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,440
same thing I was doing in other

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,260
industries and some in the same industry

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,240
and finally I felt like oh my god I can

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,770
talk to somebody about how I don't even

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,680
know how to price my services and

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,690
they're like oh well I was in that boat

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,720
- let me tell you how I fixed it and it

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,940
was amazing so that helped a lot and

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,210
then the second thing I realized is I

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,070
need help in my business right I I can't

00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,690
you can't do everything and I was at a

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:16,630
point where where I was thinking I need

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:18,310
to either hire somebody or like I but I

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,240
had no systems in place I had no process

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,400
in place I'm like I'm gonna hire

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,010
somebody what am I have them do I don't

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,560
know okay I have nothing to be like here

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,940
do this and I had nothing that like that

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,420
so I'm like I don't know what to do and

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,220
I had seen an ad from Infusionsoft it's

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,750
like the double your sales to replace an

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,710
employee with software and I'm like what

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,910
bought the ticket flew down to LA sat in

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,120
the room and I'm like replace an

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:46,540
employee with automation done bought the

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,740
software and I honestly and I automated

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,080
every single thing that you can possibly

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,240
think of in my business like everything

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,010
I'm like document it write it down put

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,100
it in a process automate it set it up

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,750
and I saved myself 50% of the admin time

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,180
I spent into my business really and it

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,790
was amazing I got the admin time okay

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,380
and and that was inspired me to look at

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,120
other avenues of my business of where I

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,250
could create systems and processes and

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,130
things that could save time to delay me

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,750
having to bring you name somebody else

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,220
after that my developer got super flaky

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,590
because I'm a designer by trade my

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,660
degrees in print design my developer got

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,030
super flaky Brian needed to make an exit

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,120
out of the fire department um he had

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:27,430
already been looking for to make an exit

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,920
but he got cancer and needed to make a

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:32,370
career change his job tried to kill him

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,800
and he's like I think I could do that I

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,020
could probably do that so he taught

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,400
himself development and Brian came in to

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,440
my business as my developer and

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,930
eventually I was like I always my bio

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,940
forever was like Jennifer hired her

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,900
husband to be her boss stupid decision

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,340
[Laughter]

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,840
because I always joked with my guy I

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,170
brought Brian into my business to do

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,910
everything I don't like to do and for

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,130
years he always joked he's like my job

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,010
is just clearing a path to get stuff out

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,440
of your way so you can do things uh and

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,970
that made a huge difference uh there

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,550
were lots of tears in the first few

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,100
months as he wanted to change all the

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,430
things I had been pouring all my lights

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,050
myself into yeah and I had to realize

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,790
like some of the changes that are being

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,140
recommended are in my own best interest

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,180
but they're things I couldn't see

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:26,170
because I'm like this right you're so

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:28,120
close to your own stuff so bringing in a

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,400
business partner we happen to be married

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,890
so that was easier made a huge

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,780
difference but also at the same time

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,490
you're being married to your business

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,910
partner they have some objectivity

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:42,220
issues sometimes right so our mastermind

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,370
right that we had you know other things

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:48,040
like that having trusted people in the

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:52,060
community like most people know LEM and

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,430
I are are good friends and like I always

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,530
know no matter what is going on in my

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,850
business if I'm stuck if I'm like crap I

00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,230
don't even know what to do here if I

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,290
have a question I can there's always

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,690
somebody that I can call and say I need

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,760
I need a different perspective right I

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,350
need something like I could call you I

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,690
could call Chris I could call Shawn like

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,520
I have like having a group of people

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,200
that you know that would never utter a

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,510
word of that to anybody that have got

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,220
your back no matter what there's

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,190
something about that that's just like

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,320
okay you got this right or if something

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,700
does go south you've got people that can

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:30,470
help pick you back up sure

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:33,290
yeah so my my parents were business

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,330
partners for 35 years and I frankly I

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,850
could never really do that right I just

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,470
couldn't see it I don't get it I didn't

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,580
understand how that works

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:46,190
I really just and so so talk to me about

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:50,870
that for a second because how how do you

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:53,660
separate running a business together and

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,910
then running a family together and then

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,060
being a couple how do you separate those

00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,950
things so we manage our kids and we

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,300
manage our clients and we watch our

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,020
relationship all in the exact same way

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,700
same process basically it's all very

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,710
similar we always joke managing your

00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,450
clients is like managing your kids um

00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:18,200
but uh it is a lot easier for me to

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,210
separate things than Brian okay we no

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:25,670
longer work together in case nobody knew

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:28,670
that he left me in January he abandoned

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:31,970
our company to go work somewhere else

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,290
um so I'm back on my own but for for the

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,760
years that we work together people would

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,830
always be like how do you do that and

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,490
I'm like we have separate offices in our

00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:43,070
house so we don't share space because I

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,140
am messy and he is not so we have

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,730
separate offices we both work with

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,160
headphones on and I'm like if I need

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,840
something from him I'm like slack like

00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,640
hey dude I need this send it to me and

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,950
he like sends it over like we come out

00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:01,220
of our office at lunch we're like hey he

00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:03,380
said what are you making me lunch to be

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,270
fair for the first 13 years we were

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,650
married Brian did 100% of the cooking

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,120
all of the cleaning and all of the

00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,410
laundry and all of everything I did not

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,970
that's a good kid like my mom did

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,410
everything and Brian did everything as a

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,920
kid and I'm like just keep on doing it

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,210
no but when he when he got cancer there

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,270
was really nothing I could do for him

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,560
except make food and I was terrible at

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,300
it cuz I didn't know how to cook but I

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,590
learned how to cook and then he was like

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,110
now that you're decent at this I think

00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,240
I'm done like I did it forever now it's

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,480
your turn so now he's like if I don't

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,160
cook word going out but um but uh we've

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,060
had conversations like I tell people

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,860
working together

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,650
Bres was never a big issue like it was

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,060
we never it was we've always done

00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,710
everything together and some of it might

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,650
have been we got married the day after I

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,330
turned 20 so we were babies and we I say

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,330
like I kind of grew up into adulthood

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,530
with weed like we grew up together so

00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,300
we've always done everything together

00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,980
and business was no different but there

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,350
were days where I had to sit down and

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,350
tell Brian I need to feel like a wife

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,750
and not a co-worker like you've been

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,430
really busy I've been really busy like

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,710
business has been taking up all of our

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,360
time like we haven't had a date night in

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:16,540
a while and I'm starting to feel like

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,540
the co-worker and not a beloved wife

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,330
right so um so we have those moments

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,770
where it's like and some of that is open

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,440
communication like I had and he's like

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:29,090
oh my gosh yes like like yeah we've been

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,100
going crazy like it's busy and sorry

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,050
like it's a little harder for him to

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,320
shut all that stuff off it just is yeah

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,900
it's his personality so date nights or

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,850
something that we we started doing and I

00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,330
don't post all our date night selfies

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,440
anymore because it was irritating people

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,870
because we do date nights more than

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,190
anybody else I know so we we do we do

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,470
date nights at least once a week

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,780
sometimes two or three times a week good

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,940
but we go to we go to the bar and we go

00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,250
to shows and we see bands and and that's

00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,810
what we do but we get out of the office

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,580
and we leave all this stuff when you

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,100
work at home for us it was like we got

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,170
to leave home like I am in an office I

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,390
closed my door and I'm like I'm done but

00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,520
Brian's in the if Brian has the whole

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,930
entire for a half of the house now so

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,390
but it's the front half of the house

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,400
like there's no closing a door so for

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,630
him it was it was harder to to let all

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,130
that go so we're like no we got to leave

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,840
the house let's go out to dinner let's

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,460
go see a band let's go to the bar let's

00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,470
go hang out friends like let's get out

00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,810
and that's maybe that's made a huge

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,790
difference to things I'm thinking about

00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:33,290
come to think of it my parents had

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:35,120
separate offices yeah I tried to get

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:39,860
Brian to share my space at one point he

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,560
was like are you crazy are you crazy but

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,570
to reflect back on something that nathan

00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,000
said it sounds like but the key to

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,730
making this work making what you made

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,080
work was open communication right on

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,049
both sides oh yeah

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,909
our kids the same thing like we would I

00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,830
know it's gonna be a particularly busy

00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,240
week I have big deadlines brian has a

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,289
lot of meetings like we've got stuff

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,510
going on at the beginning of the week

00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,549
sometimes we'll say all right guys this

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,080
week's go suck like we're probably gonna

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:08,700
work some late nights we've got some big

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,470
deadlines like you're on it take care of

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,000
your like you have to take care of your

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,590
stuff this week when they were really

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,169
little and they couldn't understand all

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,820
that like we have always been super open

00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,230
with our kids they know our finances

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,390

00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,340
about our existence of our family they

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,750
know and when they were really little

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,029
and they didn't understand all the

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,830
things like when we relaunched the

00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:05,549
on vacation and so we've always had that

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,529
kind of open communication through our

00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,139
through the whole family so we're always

00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:12,809
on the same page about expectations and

00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:14,730
what's going on and if Ryan's got a

00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,200
really busy day I'm trying to pull work

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,730
off his plate if I thought of big

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,799
deadlines he's trying to pull work off

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,149
my plate if the kids have got tons and

00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,470
tons of homework those are the days

00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:24,630
we're like don't worry about anything

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,669
just get your stuff done like we'll do

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,350
all this stuff right like it's it's a

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:29,940
push and pull between all four of us so

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:34,380
whoever has the most stuff to do that

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,149
day gets priority in our family and this

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,710
goes without saying family relation and

00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:39,750
and your relationship that is a priority

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,889
that is your priority over your business

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,990
but one thing I know about you and you

00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,820
just said it said it very quickly about

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,130
your trip to Disneyland one thing I know

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,929
about you is when you're on vacation

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,850
you're on vacation right you are

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,320
disconnected right there is no

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,669
contacting me very that plug that right

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,139
all right correct yeah so expand on that

00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:03,090
explain that explain why why that's

00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:04,559
important I don't wait years in my

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,820
business would never take a vacation or

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,170
I would

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,670
take a vacation but I would work the

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,080
whole entire time and then be like why

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,570
do we even go on vacation you just

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,230
worked the whole time uh and it was it

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,850
was awful and and we we started little

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,100
like people are always like now we take

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,630
like nine weeks of vacation a year and

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,550
like lots of long weekends and things

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,050
but um people would always say how do

00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,360
you guys do that like well we started

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,060
small like I started my goal was like

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,100
let's do one day let's just do one day a

00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,920
week where I I'm not doing client work

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,750
like one day and then was let's try to

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,000
go the whole weekend without doing

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:42,600
client work right and then the next was

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,030
let's try to stop at 5:00 every day like

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,370
that was a big deal for me and then it

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,680
was let's try to do a three-day weekend

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:52,230
let's try it I'm gonna take in the week

00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,760
right so we started little and built it

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:58,110
up and built it up and ii built it up

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:01,080
but for for me now i'm better for my

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:06,570
clients when I have a break yeah like I

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,850
know uh I can I can hustle hard and work

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,740
my butt off for about six to eight weeks

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,050
before I hit that point of I'm feeling

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,060
burnout right like that's about how far

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,760
I can go before you start to reach that

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,930
oh why am I even doing this like I'm

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,570
exhausted I'm getting tired I'm getting

00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:23,940
burnout so as long as I know every six

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,770
to eight weeks I nee go on vacation like

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,390
I need to go somewhere it might be a

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,800
three-day weekend a four-day weekend it

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,510
might be a week it might be a nine day

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,950
road trip whatever it is every six to

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,140
eight weeks I need to do something where

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,020
I'm disconnected and I'm gone any time

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,000
for myself to recharge to relax so I can

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,710
come back refreshed because guess what

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,450
when you're overwhelmed and you're

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,490
burnout and you're exhausted you're not

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,410
doing your best work you're not giving

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,540
your clients the best and what we

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,340
started to find is where I'm telling my

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,530
clients we're gone so we're what we warn

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,210
them way in advance the clients who do

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,860
get invited into our project management

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,260
system we plan all of our trips for the

00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,430
whole year in December so we know every

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,300
single trip we're taking the whole

00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,610
entire year

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,730
in December we load it all into our PM

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,350
system our retainer clients know those

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,610
clients they know every single day we're

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,700
gonna be out of the office for the year

00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,200
as soon as we know for the rest I would

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,680
put it in my email signature we're

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,540
closed

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,010
this week we're closed this week and we

00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,570
tell clients get us your stuff by this

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,149
date if you want it done before we're

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,279
gone otherwise

00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:22,960
wait till we get back and it would give

00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,339
them these mini deadlines that all of a

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,440
sudden everything would start getting it

00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:27,700
done so my vacations would give clients

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,719
all these mini deadlines because you

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,830
know when you leave all of a sudden

00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:31,119
every single person wants everything

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,429
done they've ever wanted in their entire

00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,719
life done before you go so all of a

00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:36,219
sudden all these mini deadlines my

00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:38,649
projects were getting done faster

00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:41,409
because I was leap because I was out of

00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:42,489
the office and unavailable um so I was

00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,259
doing better work

00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:46,389
my clients were getting their projects

00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,739
done faster and what's funny is some of

00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:49,779
our best clients started scheduling

00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:54,039
their vacations the same week so we work

00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:55,719
all three of our clients did that they

00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,789
would take their summer vacations for

00:22:55,719 --> 00:23:00,219
the same weeks that we were gone so and

00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:01,719
nobody was working on anything so I'm

00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:02,979
gonna reiterate something you said for

00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:06,309
the audience but really mostly for me

00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:09,099
right so when you are burned out you're

00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:11,169
not doing your best work no and I need

00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,249
to take that to heart yeah but something

00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:14,019
else you said I would kind of kind of

00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:15,940
reflect it on a few things you said

00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:18,249
you're self-aware right so you know your

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,109
limits right you know when you're gonna

00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:23,169
be burned out you know how long you can

00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:26,799
go without a break right and you're also

00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:29,469
managing expectations both your own your

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,609
families and your clients and you're

00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:32,200
managing all around and you're doing

00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,879
them well ahead of time so that

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,649
everybody knows what to expect so that

00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,899
when you're out it's not a surprise

00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:41,349
right and you granted if there's an

00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:44,019
emergency they can get a hold of me but

00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:45,309
I haven't had that happen good one

00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:46,929
emergency happened while we were on

00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:50,440
vacation once it was our own it was with

00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:52,269
our own sight so that was it we have we

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,690
haven't had to deal with it all right

00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:57,159
got time for a couple quick questions

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,599
the hand went up over here first so

00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,599
let's start over there okay I'll get you

00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:09,009
I'm a project manager fan girl what's

00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:12,460
your system my project management system

00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:16,149
when you keep talking about oh I use

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,499
Basecamp but the client management and

00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:19,779
system that I create is called

00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:21,729
profitable project plan and it's just

00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:24,179
one that I created for myself but the

00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:28,080
software that I use is basically

00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,080
Basecamp yeah okay

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,340
thanks Jen question for you you

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,559
mentioned the automation of a big fan

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,970
starting out in particular for a small

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,440
business what do you suggest what are

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,260
some viable examples of things you can

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,899
automate oh that's a great question

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,679
so I examples of things that you can

00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:51,710
automate if you're just starting out

00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:54,510
anything that you do more than one time

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,340
it's but anything that you do if the

00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,669
best thing to do is to start writing

00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:02,940
down like I had a task book it was just

00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:05,070
lined and I printed it at FedEx office

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,840
and bound it but it sat on my desk and I

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,269
just documented every single thing that

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,460
I did every day I wrote it I like

00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:13,950
writing things down on paper so I did it

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,600
that way for months I did that for

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,950
months and then I went back and I just

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,899
grabbed a highlighter and it's like

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,549
every single time there was this I

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:21,840
highlighted it in yellow and I flipped

00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:23,700
through the book laws watching TV one

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,870
night and highlighted it and I'm looking

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,419
at these things and I'm like I'm doing

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,250
the same thing over and over and over

00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,809
automate that if there's something that

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,570
you have to do on every single client

00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:35,389
project automate it if there's something

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,100
you have to do in your business

00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:39,990
administrative wise figure out ways that

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,720
you can take that you can automate it

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:45,299
and take out the manual need to do that

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,029
right anything that is repetitive no

00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:49,350
matter how small it is if you can take

00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:50,970
it off your plate it's one less thing

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,070
that's gonna take up space in your mind

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,389
it's one less thing you have to do and

00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,399
even if you're like this only saves me

00:25:54,389 --> 00:26:01,110
five minutes but if you're doing it 50

00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:03,240
times that adds up over time last

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,279
question hey Jen I was in your talk

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,750
yesterday and at the end you had a slide

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,570
where he had a bunch of your different

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:12,210
brands and your programs yeah what is

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:15,720
your secret to getting those programs

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:18,360
done when you've got a bunch of client

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:23,940
work how did you structure your time and

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:27,210
manage that so two things one I do

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:30,389
client work from roughly 9:00 to 5:00 or

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,880
like 10:00 to 5:00 sometimes but my son

00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:35,429
gets up in the morning at 5:30 every day

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,820
and I make him pancakes at 5:30 every

00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:40,379
day just the two of us chocolate chip

00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,970
pancakes or chocolate chip waffles every

00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:44,070
single day and then we

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,160
spongebob chilly goes to school they

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,050
leave at 8 o'clock I don't do client

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,800
work until 9:00 or 10:00 every day so

00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:55,500
everything I do before that is for

00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,060
myself and let me get to me let me tell

00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,720
you something really quick um and then

00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:02,100
and then I'll tell you a funny story uh

00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,660
if you get to the end of the day and you

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,980
haven't finished a client project and

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,220

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,900
you gonna do you're gonna keep working

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,070
if you get to the end of the day and the

00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,110
thing you didn't get done was for

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,590
yourself what are you gonna do put it

00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:19,440

beaver builder sorry ever that beaver

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,000
bank's fault not beaver builder but he

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,680
built like it was so ugly and it was

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,420
they had like a placeholder YouTube

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,800
video and it had nothing to do with my

00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,530
front like my course

00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,450
it used a URL that I hated and things

00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,120
like here's a username and password and

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,920
knowing that I'm like I have to fix it I

00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,750
have to fix it I have never seen a

00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,070
beaver Vil builder video like they're my

00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,470

even look

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,070
your thing um I had never watched a

00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:58,390
tutorial I'd never seen a video I'd

00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,679
never done anything because like here's

00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,120
the username password and fix it and I

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,370
was dying out like I have to make this

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,990
and they go in test him it to their

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,450
product I was able to do every single

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,070
thing I wanted to do on that page not

00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,440
ever having watched a tutorial or

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,510
anything I was able to make every change

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,520
I wanted to make and it went live wet

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,320
like three days later and I put the

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,990
course for sale the beta and I put the

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,049
bait up and up 40 people were in the

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,120
beta and it was amazing and then every

00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,580
I'm in the middle of the sixth one right

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,909
now and this will be week nine of the

00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,980
sixth run of it um but but every time

00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:34,360
like for every single time Brian would

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,370
see Chris afterwards cuz he's like

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,070
Brian's just Brian gets all the money

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,130
notifications and so every time he'd be

00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:44,260
like thanks for making Jen get that done

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:46,690
thanks for making Jen get that dad but

00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,820
but the impact that it was able to make

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,250
because my goal was to diversify income

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,780
to because up until that point 100% of

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,880
my home was relying on client services

00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,440
and I wanted to diversify some of that

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,940
so I could work a little bit less and do

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,409
some other things and try some other

00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:04,330
things and yeah and and I've been able

00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:06,299
to do that through through courses and

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,820
now I have lucrative leads as well and

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,929
content camp is a accelerate is a

00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,110
retreat

00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:15,880
it's a weird COFF you guys yeah I do a

00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,650
retreat for women business owners the

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,620
next ones in October called accelerate

00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,919
and I finally have time I that I'm doing

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,570
a three-day live event in September two

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,429
days before word camp Sacramento but

00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,950
it's all content it's it's called

00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:32,200
content camp it's a workshop so you're

00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,760
doing all the work there but I'm really

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,490
really excited about that and this is

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,140
the first time I've had room in my

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,080
business to be able to play with ideas

00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,090
and a couple years ago I had said to

00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,370
Brian I spent my whole career building

00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,169
everybody else's stuff like I'd like a

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,270
chance to build something on my own

00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:50,980
and I didn't have time to do it because

00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,929
we were so bogged down in client work

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,340
and profitable launching profitable

00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,130
project plan and doing that gave me

00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,770
enough space in my business to have time

00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:02,140
to be able to explore and play and see

00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:04,149
try new things and like create content

00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,179
camp and do those things that have been

00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:07,389
really really fun thank you so much for

00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,499
sure

00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:10,499
