Title: Simon Kraft: WordPress for the Future
Publication date: 2020-04-27
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	Every time, you load a website — even this one — a certain amount of carbon is emitted to the atmosphere. These emissions are tied to the amount of energy consumed in the process of delivering the websites content to your browser.
Let’s explore options for both, reducing your own websites greenhouse gas emissions and helping others to do the same by making a third of the web smarter, leaner and more efficient.

something certainly warm up good morning

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:36,090
Oh exciting yeah my talk is called

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,239
WordPress for future I derived the title

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,829
from the climate change movement Fridays

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,489
for futures you might already have

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:47,579
figured out and in fact I'm going to

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,760
talk about Internet's environmental

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:54,000
impact I will not try to discuss with

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,949
you if climate change is a real thing or

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,530
if humans caused it because I have like

00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:06,750
things I think it is yeah so also I

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,960
won't be able to give you any kind of

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,400
final solution to the problem and there

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,080
won't be a single line of code in this

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,570
talk even though it's in the debug

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:23,360
perspective but I'm going to show you

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:27,030
how we all can participate in how we can

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,420
save our planet's climate but before we

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,689
start I have a small slide to introduce

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,030
myself I'm Simon I traveled all the way

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,070
from southern Germany here by train this

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:43,200
week I was like 20 hours and the train

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,750
but I'm gonna be able to spend a day in

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,939
Glasgow yesterday I have to say it's

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,509
absolutely worth it my first time here

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:57,299
and it's I'm a wordpress developer since

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:59,149
2008 and almost since the beginning I'm

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,259
a community organizer in Germany so I

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,149
started to work with meetups

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,590
I organized to word camps over the years

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:10,649
and spend quite a lot of time for the

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,300
community also I studied biology before

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:17,020
I got into developments

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,660
special take on the topic as well let's

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:24,340
start by taking a look at the world we

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,740
know today this is Earth you might have

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,370
seen it somewhere this picture was taken

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:33,459
during Apollo 8 in the late 60s

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,890
it's called Earth's rice and it inspired

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,940
a whole generation of environmentalists

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:44,440
to take action and safer planet over the

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:48,970
last decades they did take action and

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:52,030
they were in parts successful but

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,790
despite their efforts the world we live

00:02:52,030 --> 00:03:00,580
in today is not the world from like a

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:03,250
hundred years ago this is a not so nice

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,520
example of this this satellite picture

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,080
was taken in mid-80s

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:12,780
it's the Icelandic nation of of Yuri

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,910
Nakamura meaning glacier so I just

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:21,190
talked this is the patient we're talking

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,820
about and in the mid 80s it was like

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:29,340
decently sized in the meantime and the

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:32,860
next pictures taken in some of last year

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,230
the place you vanished it's simply not

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,959
existing anymore it's the first layer in

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,640
Iceland this fate but not the first

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,480
place shook globally and it's the thing

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,890
that happens all over the world and

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,739
vanishing glaciers have like a huge

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:52,000
impact on local ecosystems and the

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:55,660
global ecosystem as well but then

00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,850
there's another world the internet

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,989
that's where I come from I the Internet

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,530
is a place where everything seems

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,260
possible

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,570
and most of our actions don't have any

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,269
real consequences except maybe if you

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:13,870
are buying a dishwasher drunkenly

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:17,370
somewhere in the web most of things are

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:21,600
free more or less

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,690
but in reality the internet looks

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,550
something like this it's like a lot of

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:31,850
computers spread all over the world in

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:36,810
data centers serving data to all of us

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:40,130
and this is kind of the problem actually

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:45,270
because this thing is a giant machine

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:48,000
it's huge and estimates show that it's

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:53,520
consuming about 10% of today's energy

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,110
output worldwide it won't shock any one

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,600
of you if I just tell you that the

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,389
internet is still growing

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,060
it's the thing so estimates show that by

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:06,330
the end of the decade the amount of

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,210
energy consumed will be doubled and

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:13,380
that's mainly problem because it's often

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:17,910
coal powered so non-renewable energy all

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:23,280
emitting carbon into the atmosphere at

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:27,240
the end of the day we are we meaning you

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,210
me your friends your caps your smart

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,760
connected toaster I don't know because

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:37,289
all of us we serve quite a lot

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:41,400
MIT study from 2013 shows that every

00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:42,770
American citizen is online for 24 hours

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,680
per week

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:49,380
it's like amount I spend online just

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,950
today during breakfast okay um the

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,380
average American and at the same time

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,280
web sites we tend to visit get bigger

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:07,320
and bigger in 2010 the average website

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:10,830
size was around 700 kilobytes by 2011 a

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:14,250
megabyte skywriting putting all the way

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:16,349
to 2 point 5 megabytes in 2016 which is

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,360
the news number I could find it's

00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,200
probably way higher by now because it's

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,250
like four years ago

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,640
that's analysis done by key CDN in 2016

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,139
and why am i showing all of this it's

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,520
quite easy because

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:35,550
every megabytes of every byte of data to

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:40,379
be frank transferred from server to your

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:43,680
devices uses energy and at the same time

00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,020
emits carbon to the atmosphere so that's

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,199
quite a direct link we can we can take

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,169
from the amount of data transferred to

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,960
the amount of carbon emitted yes there

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,120
are other measurements you could take

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,400
like rendering performance of a website

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,860
or JavaScript stock but all of this

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:11,930
drops in comparison to the measurement

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:18,599
of megabytes and energy data transferred

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:20,849
the data transferring is we can cut it

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,159
up in three pieces because the energy is

00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:26,909
on the one side used to run the servers

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:29,749
all data is stored on about a third of

00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:32,279
it is going to network stuff so

00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,860
transferring it from the server to our

00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:38,870
homes and from our routers to advices

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,939
and about 40% to the devices themselves

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:47,939
so my computer your smart phone your

00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:50,310
smart toaster all of the things I sides

00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:56,639
are linked in there in slide so after

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:59,729
which you can like - I have like a real

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,270
world example of all this I I picked the

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:05,819
website and when I first heard this talk

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,580
in Zurich last year I tried about

00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,399
thought about picking the word Kem's

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,529
website which is quite an unfair

00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,469
comparison because webcam websites are

00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:17,399
really bad and working organisers can't

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:19,199
do anything about it

00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:22,710
because they're like centrally managed

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,990
and so I started to pick the city's

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:29,039
website

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:31,669
sorry comm ch probably but over time I

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,610
got stuck with the website of Cologne

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:39,240
currently website in Germany it's the

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,620
official city's website and I'm going to

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,580
explain why our stuck with the

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:48,420
the site is about 2.4 megabytes if you

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:54,390
did you love it and doing some

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:57,930
interesting math about that as well and

00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:59,910
we can say that point five grams of co2

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:04,800
are emitted per page view of this site

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:12,750
and no one here has an idea of this a

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:15,900
lot saw a few look at a spa so the

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:19,230
specialty about the Cologne is on their

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,380
official City website this advertisement

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,150
I don't know why they're like banners

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,200
and pop-ups and stuff it's quite a

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:31,260
lovely site and because of this we know

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,600
it precisely how many people access the

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:42,180
site every day how often is accessed

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:45,180
1.14 4 million times 80s means not only

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:50,340
real person visiting the site but also

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:53,700
like Coronas and the toaster if we do

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:58,500
the math on this we come up with 617

00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:01,770
kilo of carbon emitted each day just

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,640
from this one site or eighteen point

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:10,170
five tonnes per month or 222 tons per

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:15,300
year it's quite a lot a kilogram of co2

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:20,250
in like open space would be a spheric

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:22,000
shape like a meter size so it's really

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:27,069
really

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,420
and just by reducing this 2.4 megabyte

00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:31,110
site by just a couple of hundred

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:35,860
kilobytes would make a huge difference

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:37,990
seen over the whole year but we are on

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,810
the word camp and so the scale I'm

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,629
looking at is this quite another but

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:46,689
another thing let's talk about the third

00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:49,500
of the web that's WordPress is market

00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:54,790
share among content management systems

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:57,519
so thinking about website sizes adding

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:03,160
up data transfer WordPress is quite a

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:05,199
huge huge thing and that's the first

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,560
good news for today because we can

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:11,589
change things we as a community have the

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,699
power to make sites smaller more

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:18,329
efficient and better performing in order

00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:22,569
to make it more climate-friendly and

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:24,759
WordPress in this ecosystem is quite a

00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:27,730
big player compared to other CMS's and

00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,819
like other world garden proprietary

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,399
systems as well the second good news is

00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:35,500
we don't need to invent any kind of new

00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,879
technology even though people trying to

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:42,430
do so later but we have like two or

00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:46,800
three really hard things to do in order

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:54,850
to make WordPress more climate-friendly

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:56,920
the first thing is culture we have to

00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,569
change the culture of bloated websites

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,759
because it's like a trend over the last

00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:03,009
couple of years that websites tend to

00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:08,170
get big and bigger we saw that by adding

00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:16,240
a lot of unnecessary stuff like autoplay

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:21,670
background videos or image sliders no

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,290
one ever looks that so we have to change

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,519
our own values and the values of our

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:32,199
clients if we if we have clients on what

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,300
we value as a good website and maybe not

00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,070
measure it by the amount of animations

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,660
we can

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,180
in there but by the amount of

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:44,610
performance and simplicity provided by

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:46,160
sight and to do all of this we need to

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:52,910
get organizing like a group of people

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,910
dedicated to that topic interesting i

00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:00,420
divided working on sustainability to to

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,630
kind of levels the one that's the more

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,490
political level is community and the

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:09,150
other one it's a personal level we're

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,220
going to look after so it's more doable

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:16,860
for right now but let's start with

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:20,250
community the community is technically

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,250
able to do so we just have to get doing

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,910
it the first step would be keeping

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,910
performance in mind in the front-end so

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,650
building performance so for building

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,320
performed teams added the backend

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:36,950
because we've distinct like things like

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,090
the Gutenberg editor there might be a

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:43,920
kilobyte or two able to shave off the

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,760
other thing the community is taking care

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,700
of already

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,720
is sustainable events events like this

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,720
one webcams

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,940
WordPress meetups there are thousands of

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,490
them over the year all of them cause

00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,780
like a kind of environmental impact and

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:05,190
that's not directly linked to this

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:09,090
megabyte and co2 comparison but it's

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,220
part of the theme and after one star and

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:14,130
one side you can use events like this to

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,130
raise awareness of the topic like I did

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:20,400
right now I on the other side you can

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:23,400
try to make the event itself more

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,920
sustainable as well I was lead organizer

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:32,700
and what Kim stood at last year and in

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:36,360
secret we like switched a whole catering

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,540
to just vegan a vegetarian options was

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,080
no meat for the whole weekend it was

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,080
quite delicious

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:49,029
yeah but we were able to cut our co2

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:51,220
emissions down by a ton for just this

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:54,430
this one measure it was a lot of other

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,560
things we did and if you do stuff like

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,990
that it's quite important to document it

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,380
because we cannot reinvent the wheel

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:05,800
every time a new word camp is organized

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,770
and you meet up this founded or new

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,330
theme or plugin gets developed have to

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,950
centralize this kind of information

00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,770
somewhere everyone could access it and

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:22,480
find the things they need in order to

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:26,040
proceed this is easier the personal

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,410
level okay just right now start with it

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:33,279
the first thing I wrote down I called a

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:35,650
website grooming it's a exercise I force

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,770
my clients to do with me all the time

00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:43,089
and I ask them the question is this

00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:45,160
really necessary and then we take a look

00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,140
at their sides and ask this question

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,370
have each and every element of the site

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:54,300
and if the answer is no if you don't

00:15:51,370 --> 00:16:00,700
need the nice shiny background video

00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:03,580
just get rid of it and by doing so you

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:08,850
kind of focus in your side more towards

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:12,010
the goal you you are trying to approach

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:15,070
another thing is sustainable user

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,260
experience by trying to get your users

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,440
to the information they're looking for

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,080
easy and quicker maybe save them a click

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,770
or two of a page load or two in order to

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,510
get there and at the same time we can do

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:32,980
a lot of optimization on other fronts

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:35,800
like SEO accessibility as well so in the

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,779
end this this is the point where most of

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,029
the of the clients are on the hook

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,670
because if I and trust me I tried it if

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:46,779
I tell them well your website is killing

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:49,150
people it doesn't work but telling them

00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:52,019
website ranks quite badly on Google

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:58,230
because it's slow this is

00:16:52,019 --> 00:17:01,050
I told you that we don't have to like

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:05,370
invent any kind of technology in order

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,779
to to build fast websites that's true we

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,199
have this kind of technology since the

00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,610
beginning of HTML in the 90s because

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,309
just get rid of the stuff and the site

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:18,360
is quite quick but since this is a

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:21,720
webcam I want to include some pointers

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,740
to several techniques of plugins you

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:30,390
might be able to leverage first thing is

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:33,149
image optimization it can gain a lot a

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,899
lot of data from just compromising and

00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:40,260
resizing images a website of Cologne I

00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:43,860
showed you earlier with the 2.4

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,899
megabytes in total it's like half images

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,929
and on the side there will be like

00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:51,299
really tiny tiny things so it can just

00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:55,289
reduce them quite a lot in order to make

00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:58,020
inside way way quicker I personally like

00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,909
to use a mattifying for that it's a

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,710
plugin for WordPress it's a paid service

00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,539
as well so not everyone might be

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,669
comfortable with using it about there

00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:10,230
tons of other plugins as well I think

00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:15,110
smash it is still around there's tiny

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:19,230
PNG a lot of things just search for the

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:21,929
solution next thing is also targeting

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,389
images lazy loading ladies loading is a

00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:26,010
technique where you just load images in

00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:29,250
time as soon as the user starts

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:31,559
strolling and really looking at the

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,440
pictures because don't have to like load

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:37,049
a huge image at the bottom of your site

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,500
as soon as the visitors just start

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:43,350
looking at the top there are also many

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,730
many plugins to do that the third thing

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:50,520
is caching the idea behind caching is

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,029
that you can the site gets rendered

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,409
every time a user tries to access it and

00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,600
instead of doing so you can store this

00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:00,059
rendered thing on the server and deliver

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,480
it directly without using WordPress at

00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:05,779
that moment actually saves a bit of time

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,429
but it's not the holy grail of

00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:11,119
Foreman's optimization because if you

00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:13,789
catch a huge site then you have a cached

00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:19,549
huge site doesn't change in size very

00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:24,879
much in some cases you have to do a

00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:28,039
quite hard step and switch your theme

00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:33,469
because a lot of themes are not that

00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:36,529
good to take it nicely and switching a

00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:38,989
theme is a hard thing and I won't be

00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:42,369
able to point you to one or two things

00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:45,469
that are quite quite easy to use because

00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:47,629
this case might be completely different

00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:49,940
than mine but if you have questions on

00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:54,440
this just approach me after the talk

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:58,149
maybe you can find something for you in

00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:02,929
the end there's a MP Google's idea of

00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:05,659
reinventing HTML it's quite nice they

00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:08,389
try to do really high-performance sites

00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:11,719
with this and also rank them differently

00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:17,749
I think there's a talk on this today if

00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:20,929
I'm not mistaken and M is deliberately

00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:23,869
on the bottom of my list because I don't

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:26,509
think that you have to use M in order to

00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:30,710
make a site quicker in fact my own side

00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:33,799
is I think only half the size of its M

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:41,599
version and know it's a bit faster as

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:43,719
well so don't just turn it on if you see

00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:48,799
yourself as a web professional so some

00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:51,499
developer designer landing websites I

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:56,149
don't know and there are things you can

00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:58,700
do and you should do because you know

00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:01,989
way more things about the web than your

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:06,049
most of your clients will so you're

00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:06,649
responsible to steer them in the right

00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:08,869
direction

00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:13,249
and you have to be an advocate to change

00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:15,789
and this might have heard a little bit I

00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:17,720
mean I I know that I have turned down

00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:20,060
quite a lot of clients

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,140
the years because of their ideas of

00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:26,960
sustainability an easy step you can also

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:30,590
take us switch to green hosting hosting

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,970
powered by renewable energy I've linked

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,860
a source down there the green web

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,940
foundation has a directory of green

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,680
hosts powered by renewable energy if you

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,660
sell WordPress products for

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,290
software-as-a-service things or just

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:48,140
provide plugins or themes for free you

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:50,750
can also streamline your products and if

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,570
a plug-in is used on a million sites for

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,610
just a hundred thousand a small change

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,770
we let up just like small changes in

00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,260
WordPress core and up over hundreds of

00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:03,470
millions of sites there was an article

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,470
posted by a fire developer I think from

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:10,660
the Netherlands just the other day he

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:13,340
has plugin for MailChimp integration and

00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,980
he actually did the math on how much

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,200
energy is saving by just cutting out the

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:24,110
JavaScript library it's quite impressive

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:27,380
I have to put a link on that as well to

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:29,180
conclude I have three or four mature

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,780
things you can do right now in this room

00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,790
without doing much else the first thing

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,680
is just a little bit of advertisement

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,740
you don't pay too much attention to it I

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:44,780
started a site WP for future dork

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:47,720
there's just a newsletter form right now

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,060
I will be starting to collect

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,760
information on different different ideas

00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:55,760
on the topic different initiatives so we

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,490
have like a central hub to to get our

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,280
information from and I won't spam anyone

00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:05,390
with this insider don't worry if you are

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,630
on the WordPress UK slack team there's a

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,510
sustainability Channel over there feel

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,340
free to join it and join discussion I'm

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:18,230
in there like most of the time just

00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:21,590
reading but this interesting I showed

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:24,200
you the the co2 emissions calculation I

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,690
did before with is 0.5 grams for the

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,230
website I came up with this using a tool

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:32,690
called website car

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,790
it's quite similar to a speed test so

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:39,370
you just input a URL in there and it

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:42,050
calculates the the amount of emitted co2

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:49,400
it's quite easy to use and interesting

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:50,960
but be aware it's addictive it's stopped

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,000
optimizing your site I have spent like

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,980
weeks optimizing my own site and the

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,070
last thing maybe if not for in this room

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,500
of who later talked to others it's an

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:07,880
important topic it won't just go away by

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:14,360
ignoring it and we have to make as many

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:16,610
people as possible aware of it let's end

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,030
on a high note

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:24,080
too much the glacier I showed you before

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:26,120
a vehicle in Iceland and this picture I

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,590
already said it is taken in summer first

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:32,990
year around the same time they had a

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:36,940
little ceremony over there and unveiled

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:39,920
a monument with a sign on a design

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:43,400
addressed to future generations in

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:46,520
remembrance of the glacier the sign read

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,550
is followed oak is the first Icelandic

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,680
glacier to lose its status as a pleasure

00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,870
this monument is to acknowledge that we

00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:59,150
know what is happening and what needs to

00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:01,070
be done only you know if we did it and I

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:05,360
think this quote quite impressively

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:08,440
applies to our situation as well this is

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,440
it thank you very much

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,280
[Applause]

00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:40,909
lazy loading will be able to will be

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:52,669
edited to cause some time in the future

00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:55,339
will be also very yeah which themes are

00:25:52,669 --> 00:26:00,469
more environmentally friendly um nothing

00:25:55,339 --> 00:26:04,399
half of themeforest no no seriousness I

00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:08,359
have in all 12 years I I do this not

00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:12,109
seen one well may theme more ThemeForest

00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:15,079
I don't want to offend anyone but did

00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:17,509
not get him yet and I can't give you

00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,549
like a general advice but maybe you can

00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:26,139
talk afterwards and take a look at use

00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:26,139
case for wanting any other questions

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:42,650
website carbon is is basis website

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,220
carbon is based on a on a study on how

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:50,210
much energy is consumed per megabyte of

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,220
transfer data they did a bit of math or

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,919
background it's not an exact measurement

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:59,530
because they can't look into your server

00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:02,929
and your setup but they use like average

00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:04,700
averages all kinds of data they do a

00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:06,890
really good job in explaining what they

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,059
do on the site and they do it way better

00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,159
than I can right now

00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:16,789
so if you take a look at the side and

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:19,190
they I don't think they give you options

00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:21,520
right away but if you want to have

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,120
options you can use like the Google

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:30,370
lighthouse test they are quite

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:35,350
resourceful on this its web dev slash or

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,350
something measure slash measure

00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,480
the these kinds of measures change over

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,720
the years as well because like website

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,790
carbon has like a huge relaunch late

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:28,330
last year where they updated their

00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:30,190
measurements and yeah of course Simon

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:37,810
thank you so much for coming up to Klaus

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:38,980
though for 20 hours because given the

00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:54,520
weather forecast it's gonna take you

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:57,010
even longer to get back on search engine

00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,660
optimization for your website so please

00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,390
stay polite or go over and let's thank

00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:06,249
fun again

00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,249
