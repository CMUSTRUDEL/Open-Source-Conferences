Title: David Artiss: Remote working - How to make it work for you
Publication date: 2020-04-28
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	Many WordCamp attendees are remote employees. Most will tell you how great remote working is and that it works incredibly well for a lot of businesses. But let’s be honest, it’s not for everyone. While several large companies have tried it and failed, in this talk, we’ll reveal what often gets forgotten: what a business needs to do to make it work. Further, how individuals can decide if remote work really is the future of working for them.

and my remote working welcome

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,850
hello I'm David artists today now about

00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:21,759
five years ago when I used to work for

00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:25,749
no company they had a bit of a problem

00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:27,789
they wanted to take and sort of a little

00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:30,939
office that they wanted combined them

00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:33,240
all into one the problem was one

00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:37,900
obviously wants to move everyone into

00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:43,810
didn't have in space people so they

00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:48,660
decided to start no one had their own

00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:52,180
desk who turned up and available dealing

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,160
with this even taking into account the

00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,160
number of people it was off today

00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:20,409
wasn't this management's senior

00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:21,429
management making some sweeping

00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:33,340
redundancies

00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:37,770
so actually working from home everyone

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,770
except for the only people later stood

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,130
I'm gonna find state

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,710
technically

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,420
so

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,239
[Music]

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,050
or juries

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:35,980
isn't it supposed to fire is my

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:42,610
outfit stop strolling or my nose can't

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:45,790
read okay so you talked that workouts

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,920
about when they were working how great

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,350
it is and you should all definitely do

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,020
it however if you work in a traditional

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,930
office based environment moving to it

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,170
whether just sunset for everyone is not

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,390
that simple now we're going to explore

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,430
the changes that any business will need

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,430
to make of its work

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:16,300
I'm hiring people to manage the managing

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:26,400
them day to day techniques that you can

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:26,400
use to improve both environments changes

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:42,040
understand what I mean by this take my

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,390
working requires specific mindset and a

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,320
completely different management

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,550
structure and worst of all you need some

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,120
background about myself

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,880
now if I worked automatic remote company

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,030
we have their offices and I've been

00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,210
working for three years before that

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:05,070
I spent 13 years at the most traditional

00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:08,710
office based company you can imagine

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,180
wooden cubicles and rules that movie

00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,130
could ever remember why they were there

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,180
in the first place

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,180
here's a picture of what it was like

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:28,120
and during that time I spent years

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:53,860
working now when it comes to

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:53,860
old-fashioned but I will tell you about

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,609
[Music]

00:05:14,740 --> 00:06:02,020
IBM they're working in other words so

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:05,210
you remember that used to be a silly

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,410
software and websites where your manager

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,030
was looking press the key in a

00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,280
spreadsheet would appear so it look like

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,800
you're still doing something they

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,270
existed for a reason

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:21,209
I'm gonna keep doing that since I'm

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,839
still wrong so when remote working is

00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:24,839
introduced

00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:30,860
someone's working from home how do they

00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:30,860
know what they're doing it can't happen

00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:53,219
actually knew what happened employees

00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:54,830
took advantage of the perk was

00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:56,789
unavailable for hours at a time

00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,610
another wouldn't communicate with

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,469
coworkers all day ten months in we

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,899
scrapped the benefit and now require all

00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:12,149
employees to work it straight to come

00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:14,610
into the office every day now the

00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:23,999
employees I think that mindset there

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:30,860
tells you quite a bit and yet how much

00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:30,860
time in the u.s. spends actually working

00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:45,220
and you suggested

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:55,150
it's just under three hours now it could

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:58,870
be worse okay two hours 23 minutes good

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,720
it's a source now the part of the UK

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:05,259
that I'm from I'm sure I read it's about

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,599
one and a half hours now the rest of the

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,940
time spent having brakes going to the

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,139
toilet getting coffee chatting to

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,039
colleagues about what was on television

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:17,379
previous notes etc and yet there's a

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,569
perception that remote workers are the

00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,120
ones not doing anything now why can you

00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:25,539
believe those figures or not here is

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,259
another statistic remote workers in a

00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:31,509
study with 13% more productive fewer

00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:36,010
days off and were more likely to work

00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:38,740
there every day so why can't these

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,349
bigger organizations get it to work they

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,820
say the people were less productive but

00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,910
rightfully to them it's because they

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,579
don't know what they were doing they may

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,910
be genuinely less productive as a result

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:54,040
or they just don't know they're trying

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,660
to manage them as if they're still

00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,390
working in an office the immediate

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,250
communication you can get in office

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:16,089
walking up to somebody and asking them

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:18,500
question doesn't now apply has to be a

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:22,130
change in mindset to

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,870
so what's the solution here simply put

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,410
it's better tracking of what people are

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,030
doing at a meaningful level does it

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,160
matter if somebody seems to be watching

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,950
someone Netflix or talking about the

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:40,540
beer till the evening they've just had

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:43,550
actually deliver what we need to do I

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:50,900
work intercourse and that's an easy one

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:53,750
to measure I get free in fact submitted

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,390
documentation changes internal posts I

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,120
made all sorts of communication that's

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:02,300
then monthly against any vacation time

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,790
that I had that opens comparison against

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,220
everyone else so a natural rolling

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,680
custom queries we've seen cost everyone

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,850
in the same time zone

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:21,080
there's also recognition that we're not

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:23,840
robots in stone fluctuates during the

00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,910
day I can move away from my desk maybe

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,020
have a plumber in to fix a leaky tap

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:32,120
water going over my washing I know

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,340
there's a clear expectation for me to

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,280
get work done this translates into

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,680
reviews twice a year where my progress

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,570
is correlated with expectations the

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,430
reviews are not uni-dimensional

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,670
and there's no number that tells the

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,080
whole story instead the outcome of the

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,290
background projects that I'm

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:56,120
contributing to a wealth of data around

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:58,370
my primary work customer interactions my

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,050
lead on create review which gives me an

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:06,290
incentive to keep track of my own

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:10,870
performance and achievements not doing

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,870
any work to my manager

00:11:27,440 --> 00:12:58,430
again can help you to make your own now

00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:04,310
some people we're strict rules on hours

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:06,140
work for important regimented single

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,610
rule that applies for everyone not

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,610
taking into account individuality

00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:47,180
again along the results

00:15:01,879 --> 00:16:32,159
quality is important to provide

00:15:36,209 --> 00:16:35,039
stability to those ideal solution except

00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:40,199
that people want to work in different

00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:42,119
ways discipline in a number of ways many

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,569
which can be beneficial to the company

00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,569
large

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:19,550
so timely accurate documentation is the

00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,640
same reason it becomes a lot harder to

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,680
[Music]

00:17:48,980 --> 00:18:12,350
communicate as much as possible because

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:12,350
it's the oxygen communications with

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,220
different jobs to when is when instant

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,050
communication isn't always possible we

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,680
need ways to reach out groups of people

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:28,020
easily it can drastically improve how

00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,870
you communicate by writing things down

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,820
in long form and publishing them and

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,700
giving people a chance to get back to

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:41,430
you on their own schedule you end up

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:43,650
with much deeper fairer discussions poor

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,500
communication is the root of most

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,640
disagreements conflicts and poorly

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,390
managed projects

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,450
when people understand each other

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:57,280
difficulties melt away now threatens to

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,690
oxygen your automatic cream is not

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:04,720
accidental too much oxygen as well it's

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,180
important to invest time making sure the

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,160
right information you just published its

00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,410
third undisturbed by those who need to

00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:20,770
which again comes back to having the

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:24,280
right tools working is going to work you

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:29,230
need sometimes be social in-person

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:33,850
meetups are still important the VIP - we

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:35,710
have a yearly company retreat we also

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,080
have one or two team meetings every year

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,030
as well

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,290
assisting work topics we also do things

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,600
like playing board games

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,270
karaoke or going on a city tour together

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,820
please help us to learn more about each

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:56,860
other and our families it's knowledge

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:58,770
gained in the normal week consideration

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,780
has to be given to this aspect as well

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:07,600
even in a mixed working environment you

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:09,760
need to get your staff in business

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,570
because that social interaction is

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,470
something that you need to put back

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,630
obviously cost is a big consideration

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,820
for doing something like this keep in

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,980
mind though that except for remote - you

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,260
saved money by not having to pay for an

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,230
office or paying for a much smaller one

00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:30,010
if you're doing a popular party remote

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,740
to invest the money you save on situated

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,690
expenses into these meetups because the

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,890
invaluable team-building these

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,890
experiences provide

00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:51,549
and finally you needs to consider how

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:54,350
specific hiring for remote workers now

00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,150
here's a question for everyone who's

00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,500
ever been hired where they had

00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,500
probationary goons

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,030
now he's actually really interesting

00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,030
because in most countries they exist

00:21:32,440 --> 00:22:27,290
is showing the application and the

00:21:45,700 --> 00:22:29,660
application specific questions during

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:34,340
the initial interviews around remote

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:36,380
working watch this during the trial the

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,930
trial at the same time is maintaining a

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,240
current job into your own time

00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,460
before someone even gets to the trial

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,130
stage they will often have one or two

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,450
technical exercises to do often quite

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:53,130
complex and demanding even if you can do

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:57,180
this with them performing this worth

00:22:53,130 --> 00:23:08,280
home standing it's in some people we do

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:19,470
hiring they're like this many years of

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:27,570
PHP developer from the Windows desktop

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:29,900
PC and it's 20 questions questions such

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,900
as this

00:23:30,840 --> 00:24:02,700
now explaining at the end in reality

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,720
what were the biggest benefits and

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:45,760
challenges the questions that we ask VIP

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,590
now is one of being very targeted on on

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,590
questions and general expectations

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:58,169
percentage of support engineer

00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,169
applications do you think

00:25:32,700 --> 00:26:22,870
to the beginning many of these changes

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:32,570
changes that any business whether

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:35,640
they're working or not simply

[Music]

00:27:43,530 --> 00:28:03,540
you and during the holidays one of those

00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,540
things during

00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:16,350
no there are some requirements for which

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:27,390
I can't speak for outside of the IP

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:30,179
because I have the requirement for means

00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,730
I mean there would be some conversation

00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:37,380
if I suddenly to start working the u.s.

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:39,150
time you start working evenings I think

00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,429
there's a general expectation I'm going

00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:52,290
to be working a time zone where that

00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:59,370
comes in I get a breakfast and I'm

00:29:52,290 --> 00:30:01,380
straight on it like ten hours but that's

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:08,850
taken into account that I'm probably

00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:12,750
spending hours whatever else know what

00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:19,080
kind of hours I'll be around there's no

00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:22,110
kind of like set hours but higher in

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,000
this world because it was truly flexibly

00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,770
or whatever you would hire somebody no

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,010
matter where they are but when we do

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,010
hire

00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,710
thank you

[Music]

00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:38,410
I'm just thinking what happened if I did

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:38,410
that and I will probably get a very

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,960
first about your managers needing to

00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,380
have a better idea of what you're doing

00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:55,880
should be obvious I mean the wait time

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:58,250
was I know the team working on us to

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:09,859
struggling and so I was on one II knew

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:12,290
you K times so you know managers that

00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:14,300
have an awareness of what you're doing

00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:17,150
is really helpful that because it's

00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,530
really difficult to you to me because

00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,080
that is one of the other things and

00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,020
about remote working you have all your

00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:35,630
equipment home and it was just really

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:38,210
tempting behind again this comes down to

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,160
the flexibility of it I can have really

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,410
all days we go back so you know three

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:53,300
hours of work or whatever get I still

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:56,200
have those working so I because I've got

00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:59,360
the ability to do that
