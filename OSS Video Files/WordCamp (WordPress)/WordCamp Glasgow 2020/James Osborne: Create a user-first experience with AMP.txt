Title: James Osborne: Create a user-first experience with AMP
Publication date: 2020-04-28
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	What does it mean a user-first application? It is an application that lands in four pillars: Fast, Secure, engaging and Integrated. At this Workshop, we will explain the reason why we should change our mindset to a user-first mindset to create a better experience for our users. And AMP helps on that, AMP or Accelerated Mobile Pages is a framework with three important tools, AMP HTML, AMP JS and AMP Cache. AMP HTML has a set of components that accelerate our development process and AMP JS take care of our application performance and AMP Cache is the last ingredient to provide the best experience the feature that enhances the performance of content delivering. After understanding those core items we are going to convert our WordPress Application in a User-first application using AMP. At the end we will do an exercise with five core components: amp-img amp-youtube amp-sidebar amp-lightbox amp-socialshare Letâ€™s code!.

the next talk is that exactly so thanks

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,869
guys I'm very happy to be here it's

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,619
actually my first work camp so yes

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,330
hopefully first with money so today I'm

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,670
going to talk about user first websites

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,359
and as it just hurts accelerated mobile

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,790
pages and the name accelerated mobile

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,739
pages the first one and we've actually

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,149
got rid of the name so it's not really

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,510
known as accelerated mobile pages

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:42,239
anymore it's more just amp because I'm

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,789
isn't just for mobile what we into it in

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,090
detail in there so I work in the content

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,280
experience team at Google and what we do

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,340
is we just help we build products and

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,230
tools that help the web ecosystem

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,539
there's a separate team perhaps going

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,449
hugely so we really try to focus on the

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,470
web and just different development to a

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,210
web just to improve overall ecosystem

00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:09,450
one of the biggest focuses and the team

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,210
I work in is WordPress obviously being

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,700
the most popular CMS and Google didn't

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,259
really come so much onboard previously

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,720
where plugins there's a couple of new

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,900
plugins now to psych it there's amp

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,820
which isn't really new PWA so amp and

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,650
sidekick in particular I work with the

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,950
team that development those plugins so

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,900
just to talk about user first web sites

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,939
it's a web development strategy the

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,630
course uses at the forefront of the

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,570
design process a user the users a user

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,189
experience isn't always what comes first

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,549
when people are considering the web site

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,909
and with the see on the next slide here

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,770
the website should be fast and reliable

00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:55,649
all web sites should load quickly with

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,740
reliable runtime our web site should

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,259
also be secure and visitors to your

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,439
website should feel safe a secure web

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,259
site using HTTPS also encourages trust

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,200
and good brand identity for the users of

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,190
your website a web sites also be

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,530
engaging engaging web sites

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,240
your visitors come back engaging

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,210
websites improve your bounce rate and

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,510
overall experience and also websites

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,340
that are integrated into devices that

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,070
users are using can really help you as

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,090
website owners are developers so if

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,740
you're building a website

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,240
bear in mind not all your audience are

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,670
using a top-class

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,030
smartphone they're not all located in

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,590
places with typically high broadband so

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,100
a website should be integrated to cover

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,480
for all these circumstances

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,610
so typically stakeholders friend

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,370
building website they don't always have

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,380
the user experience first in mind so web

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,630
designers they might want to make super

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,090
cool websites that lots of JavaScript

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,420
affects just to make it look good

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,190
marketers might want pop-ups and social

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,620
media naturally enough you want to make

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,600
sure people engage them off their

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,670
website as well and site owners might

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,020
want to encourage more clicks and more

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,120
visits to their website

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,860
so discussion of discussions when

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,080
building website don't always involve

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,420
end users or they don't always take into

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,830
factor problems the end users face and

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,290
when you're considering building a

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,739
website you need to think about these

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,110
things

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,820
where are your audience based do you

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,030
have a global audience should you should

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,560
you be using a content delivery network

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,080
how are they accessing your website is

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,950
most of your traffic on mobile is it on

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,010
desktop is done iPads and what's the

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,230
experience do you have a these days most

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,660
websites at the kokino us at the same

00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,360
time some websites have a pop-up to

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,160
allow them to add to homescreen and some

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,080
of them are order pop-ups as well so

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,910
sometimes when you visit a website and

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,410
mobile so can we tree or four clicks

00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,400
four people can actually read the

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:05,090
content to want to go to also is a

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,820
website it's accessible websites should

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,739
be properly coded with all the new tag

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,080
all the new HTML tags just to make it

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,769
more accessible which would bring in a

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,780
new audience to your website as well so

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,030
accessible websites and car just bring

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,919
an audience that have for example people

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,460
who might be hard of seeing or hard of

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,990
hearing accessible websites cover

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,370
it just make it a lot more accessible

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,199
for those type people structured data -

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,789
there's not enough effort put into

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,039
structured data on a lot of websites

00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:38,440
these days and a wordpress in particular

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,900
it's just plugins that can help you with

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,669
structured data themes as well should be

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,410
playing their part in the ecosystem to

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,810
make sure their themes are compatible

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,880
and using structured data just to make

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,020
it easy for you as web site you

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,389
WordPress users this brings stamp which

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,840
is a its web components framework and

00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:01,870
just designs timet had helped you build

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,120
user first web sites it brings in all

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,550
the top software engineering by best

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,280
practices as lots of really cool tools

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,610
built in lazy loading is built in and

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,440
the CSS restrictions to just help with

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,009
performance and also javascript

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,949
limitations which it might be one of the

00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,509
people might think it's a drawback that

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,370
javascript is restricted in amp but

00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:26,530
actually javascript is contributed to

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,800
the biggest problems when it comes to

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,810
website performance so as I mentioned to

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,970
amp isn't just for mobile so it's

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,710
considered amp now because a lot of

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:40,840
websites are using amp on desktop also

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:44,229
so amp is built for the open web it's

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,190
built just using traditional web web

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:51,789
coding languages HTML and so amp HTML

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:54,070
amp itself is a subset of HTML so you

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:57,219
have in typical HTML you might have an

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,990
image tag in am it's just an amp - image

00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:02,979
so it's not that difficult to learn

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:05,349
basic HTML and in relation to JavaScript

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,020
amp has lots of different components and

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,180
features amp is actually built

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,590
javascript in the backend and all the

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,599
components are also built with

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,310
JavaScript so when you're considering

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,440
features for your website

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,599
or if you're a if you own a web

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,699
development agency you don't need to

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,889
know as much JavaScript as you were

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,900
previously all these components come

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,169
ready-made they're carousel store

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,180
slideshows their sidebars so when people

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,680
say oh I can't use JavaScript now

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,719
there's lots of different components

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,129
that you can easily use and you just

00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:39,409
need to style so

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,759
talking with developers before they're

00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,709
able to hire people and train them up

00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,969
really really good because these

00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:49,189
developers don't need to put as much

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:51,439
emphasis on JavaScript CSS to CSS works

00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:53,659
perfectly well in amp and it's just a

00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:58,159
way to lots of people use CSS to style

00:06:53,659 --> 00:07:00,529
the different JavaScript components so

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:03,469
the user experience of amp is vastly

00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:06,499
vastly improved lots of benefits amp

00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:10,550
have over an amp website has over an

00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:13,240
unemployed site so amp is all about

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,189
speed websites raw was instant loading

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,589
web sites are also served from amp cache

00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,569
where possible so I'm not sure if you're

00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:22,309
familiar with amp cash but it works very

00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:24,729
similar to a content delivery network

00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:29,300
and we'll talk about that in a minute

00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:31,879
also in amp all content is lady lazy

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,740
loaded by default so I'm sure many of

00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,249
you were are lazy loaded is but

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,079
basically content is loaded when needed

00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:41,959
also there is restrict JavaScript and

00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,269
CSS there's no inline styling and our

00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,740
content is statically defined so if

00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:49,699
you're using an iframe or lots of other

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,349
features to render the page it takes

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,469
it's much faster because there's less

00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:57,019
calculations before the page loads also

00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:58,879
all elements and amp components they're

00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:01,389
loaded asynchronously so there's no

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,909
waiting for each different to Egypt load

00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:06,559
and visitors to an amp website also they

00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,899
experience consistent and expected

00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:10,579
functionality there's no there's no live

00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,349
when you're sliding through web a

00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:15,619
website on your phone or there's no

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:17,539
delay and secure security instability is

00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:19,610
a feature in amp as well it's one of the

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,860
biggest features in amp so if you have

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,009
an iframe in amp which would be an amp

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,929
iframe all the content is sandboxed so

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:31,009
it doesn't impact on the loading of the

00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:34,099
original website so amp brings lots of

00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:37,029
site owner benefits and just less

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,259
servers resources required because

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:41,839
initial loads to the website from

00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:44,860
organic search are served by from amp

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,240
cache so your servers not being hit

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,430
so if you were really popular website

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,920
you think in well I might have to

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,090
upgrade my server with amp there's less

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,910
of a need for that because it's been

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,580
served from amp cache also you can get

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,350
featured on the top stories carousel in

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,970
Google News and there's lots of other

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,550
platforms that you might not be aware of

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,010
but they they prioritize amp content

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,850
over regular content if you have apps

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:14,540
like Flipboard smart news all these

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:18,440
platforms just they they put amp content

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,150
on top of traditional content and

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,100
there's a collection of ready to go to

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,780
components so as I mentioned there's no

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,760
need to hire expensive JavaScript

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,560
developers to if you're looking for

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,570
particular functionality you can look at

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,940
what functionality exists in the

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,080
existing components style them or change

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,380
them to suit your own needs

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,470
I still security stability also for site

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,990
owners it's just a big big plus with amp

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,330
over traditional non website an amp

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,880
website too while they don't have to be

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,910
HTTP some functionality might not work

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,030
so it's always encouraged all websites

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,850
these days should be secure anyway and

00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:59,120
also if your news publisher are using

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,100
ads amp ads work much faster much better

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,900
than traditional apps they don't use

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,660
JavaScript do not depending on

00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,970
third-party ad servers and ad networks

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,560
and you just perform much better and my

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,750
previous role in Google I used to work

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,760
with a lot of publishers and Loblaws

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,040
publishers they might not be ready to go

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,140
amp just yet but they do start

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,150
implementing amp ads over regular ads

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,950
which is perfectly possible so I'm cache

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,090
I'll talk briefly when app cache does

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,600
anyone know what a content delivery

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:31,310
network is yep so you know what it is so

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,430
content delivery network for those don't

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,770
know it means it's a network of computer

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,060
like a servers across the world and if

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,900
you're using a content delivery network

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,510
like I was on web services or cloud

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,550
your website is stored in all those

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,470
servers across the world so

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,170
traditionally if you've you buy a web

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,930
host here in Glasgow someone access in

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,520
that website in Sydney might take a lot

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,170
longer to load and a warden in Glasgow

00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,540
if you're using a content delivery

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,430
network that website would be served

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,020
from the closest delivery point so it

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,490
could be served from Sydney so that's

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,460
just one advantage of a content delivery

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,890
network and I'm tasks work similar to a

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,170
content delivery network if you do a

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,320
search on your phone from mobile to

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,720
search for latest news here and dad's go

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,580
your seed little amp singer when you

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,770
click on any of those it's been served

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,210
from am cash she allows look for a

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,640
little amp icon you might not be aware

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,980
of usually it's in the image that's been

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,770
served from amp ash and any follow-on

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,690
clicks are being served from the website

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,910
origin so that's why it's a little bit

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,589
different to a traditional CDN which you

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,020
would pay for so amp cache just

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:42,250
initially initial load is served from

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,200
cache Google Cloud fair being and lots

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,630
of other providers

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,860
host amp cache servers so you might not

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,300
be aware of what you're accessing your

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,640
website a cached version of your website

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,040
on being servers on Google servers on

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,260
cloud for servers so one of the push

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,020
backs we get about amp is all my content

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,180
is Google control all my content lots of

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,670
different providers support amp cache

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,150
and it's a it's just a way for improving

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,220
business experience to your website so

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,380
as mentioned is the initial load is

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,720
served montage works similar to a CDN

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,230
and it's also particularly useful if

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,360
your audience is global so I'm

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,790
components ready-made JavaScript

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,380
components and functionality ready to go

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,570
for your website I won't go into too

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,890
much detail there's I don't know how

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,510
manage is probably a couple of hundreds

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,920
of different components so whatever you

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,870
are looking for whether you want to Gio

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,300
block some content whether you want a

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,430
nice navigation menu does components for

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,010
all these features and it just makes it

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:42,400
super easy to develop a website that's

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:44,200
users is at the forefront I'm point this

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,200
one in particular it's a way to get

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,970
around JavaScript limitations so if you

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,829
want to toggle classes which would

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,959
traditionally be done with jQuery or

00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,400
JavaScript and point is really useful

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,960
component

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,910
to kind of get around that limitation

00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,860
without any performance impact and just

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,660
going back to components also if you go

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,700
on the amp dot dev website which is the

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,650
whole project website you can test out

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,540
these components so it's really useful

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,850
just a test demo and you can configure

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,740
them as well so before going live

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,300
putting them on your own website you can

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,890
just configure these components and see

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,660
well that's what they fit in well with

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,490
my WordPress website and as you know

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,790
what Gutenberg as well you could make it

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,610
reuse of the block for those components

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:29,580
so that brings us to amp with Gutenberg

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,690
so amp has support for all the different

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,240
building blocks if you're using

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,220
Gutenberg it also has enhanced image

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,710
support if you have an amp web say

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,240
images raw I already had the lightbox

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,800
effect you can click on them on any

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,620
website you'd see they pop up in a nice

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,870
model window I also has native WordPress

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:50,190
support for embeds and short codes when

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:54,120
you're using amp so has anyone used the

00:13:50,190 --> 00:14:02,990
official I'm plugin you have so how did

00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:02,990
you find the experience okay well that's

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:16,110
yeah and there's different programs here

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:24,420
and like you said there's different

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:25,620
ratings yeah well I suppose that's why

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,290
I'm here and I'm not going to go into

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,850
too much technical gain but I'm going to

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,260
talk about the official AM plugin so

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,750
automatic we're on board

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,240
Arion in the initial releases of the

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,770
plug-in and now there's quite a few

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,090
different developers and lots of the

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,090
ones I work with it good yeah

00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,480
it's gonna be a lot harder and I don't

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,360
see much examples of people using amp

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,830
without a plug-in because the way I

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,180
suppose just the way WordPress you have

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,640
your back-end and your front-end amp

00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:00,370
works in the backend really most of the

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:02,260
work you certainly could what I just

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,280
recommend using a staging site install

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,650
the program I wouldn't recommend

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,150
especially if you're using a CMS like

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:11,740
WordPress I wouldn't recommend trying to

00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:15,340
do amp without plug-in this exactly it's

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,600
that's true yeah so this plug-in and you

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,450
might see like you said you saw all

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,940
different types of reviews so lots of

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,620
the poor the worst review is a for an

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,230
early stage of the plug-in when we

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,980
didn't have different modes so we'll go

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:32,200
into an out you see here just a brief

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,850
image of the different modes so this one

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,260
reader mode initially this was called

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,750
classic mode and this was the only

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:40,150
different mode of the amp plug-in and

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,520
that's why people were saying um I don't

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:47,260
think it's for me it doesn't look as

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,970
well as I'd like it so since last year

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,250
there's been transitional and standard

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,510
mode so reader mode would go into

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,490
different modes a minute book reader

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,470
mode is basically for websites that are

00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,430
using themes WordPress sites that are

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:02,500
using themes which aren't compatible so

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,170
you'll see here the main use is

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,180
non-compatible themes you might not be

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,920
aware but the song the Metro UK they're

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,690
all WordPress websites they're all using

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,300
the official amp plug-in and are using

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,480
it in reader mode reader mode isn't the

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,070
best example of amp because it's not it

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,170
doesn't use the existing WordPress theme

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,900
so you don't really it's not the best

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,850
right it's not ideal to have your amp

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,360
website and you're not I'm looking

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,970
different

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,790
that's why reader mode exists just for

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,440
teams that aren't compatible and so the

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,060
Metro in the song did customize the

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,890
reader mode looks a little bit different

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,300
they've added navigation menus I mean

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,310
when you do a search for any of their

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,930
content on mobile you'll be directed to

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,900
an amp website you might not be aware

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,510
around an amp website but you are the

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,430
parents has a basic look and feel

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,320
because it needs to be it needs to

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,279
support teams that aren't compatible its

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,529
detached from your exist

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,600
also there's error handling which is a

00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,310
feature of the official amp program and

00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,900
all invalid content whether it's

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,850
JavaScript functionality it's

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,040
automatically stripped out so you don't

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,610
have to Depot or try fix problems that

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,189
don't work in am also content type it's

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,050
only for individual pages and posts so

00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:14,209
if your widgets or your home page shows

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,880
lots of different blog entries that's

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,370
not going to have an amp version and the

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,199
reason being is kind of want to move

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,790
people away from reader mode to using an

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,699
amp compatible theme or using

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,650
transitional or standard mode and to

00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,660
access an amp website or URL structure

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,940
you just need to type in for assessed

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,100
question mark amp at the end but I've

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,900
waited before the end of the slideshow

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,910
I'll show you easily how to identify if

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,590
you're on a an amp website and to test

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:44,000
out how other people have implemented

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:45,590
amp so transitional modes you see an

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,720
example of a couple of sites using amp

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,670
and transition mode so if you've a

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,730
developer on board you're able to fix

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,890
any incompatible themes or preferably if

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,530
you're using a compatible theme such as

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:00,470
any of the Genesis framework themes the

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,420
core WordPress themes a newspaper

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,320
January press two lots of themes that

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,970
work in amp perfectly well and

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,520
transitional mode or standard mode are

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,960
the modes you'd want to be going for

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,420
with transitional you have your typical

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,700
non amp website like you normally would

00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,240
but you also have an amp version for

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,620
each page posts any type of taxonomy so

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,750
yes you have your amp and none I'm

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,280
running alongside each other and the

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,380
reason being you're in transitional and

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,270
not fully amp it might sound confusing

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,480
but you might have some pages in your

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,160
website that you need to work you need

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,690
JavaScript functionality for some parts

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,580
of your website and that's why you might

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,120
go transitional until you're ready to go

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,980
100% amp and as I mentioned you wouldn't

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,530
identify if you're on a transition mode

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,230
amp website or not because they look and

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,780
they work the same so the appearance it

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,400
uses your existing WordPress theme it

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,870
has error recording and one of the

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,670
really good features about the official

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,920
amp plug in it tells you everything

00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,960
that's not going to work in amp and it

00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,000
allows you to keep that functionality or

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,020
remove that from

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
preferably you remove that functionality

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,559
and find an amp valid replacement

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,350
whether it's a component we just

00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,630
mentioned or whether it's the plug-in so

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,240
if you're using a forms plug-in for

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,919
example some form saw beans might have

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,480
working up and that's reason you might

00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,540
use transitional you need to find a

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,710
replacement or you need to find

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:27,299
something that some form that will work

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:29,190
it out so the plug-in that the

00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:35,880
validation tool that kind of those are

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:37,350
the hard work for you so well if you're

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,900
developing a plug-in you can also

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,669
develop it with a staging WordPress

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,020
website or something locally so if

00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,520
you're using the official plug-in it's

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,290
really useful because when you're

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,450
developing your own plug-in it will tell

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,580
you all the non amp valid features of

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,350
your program so you can fix that and you

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,740
can use the amp point component or find

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,880
workarounds so it's great more the more

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,490
I'm compatible plug ins

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,070
the faster the ecosystem goes because we

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,990
don't want especially non-developers

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,110
having problems with our websites and

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,179
still using reader mode so more plugins

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,540
that are made I'm compatible more

00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,770
developers make the faster developers

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,870
make their themes and plugins I'm

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,660
compatible it can really benefit them as

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,580
well because one of the things I see

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,080
some I used to talk with publishers and

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,030
they weren't ready to go out because to

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,090
having a slideshow or some features that

00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,760
just won't work enough so but that goes

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,559
brings us onto the themes an ecosystem

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,049
never on the recent election of themes

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,700
news pack and our new modern things the

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:38,190
build WordPress best Anders

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,200
they're usually compatible but always

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,730
check first or just ask the developer

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,770
and if you're not a developer yourself

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,809
it's always worth asking the plug-in or

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:49,740
theme developer the intent on making the

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:52,620
and compatible so standard mode is an

00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,630
amp first approach it uses your existing

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,850
WordPress theme and you don't have an

00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,460
amp website running alongside in non amp

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:02,040
website the website is 100% ample

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,860
notes superfast amp is all about speed

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,990
and performance improvements and yeah

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,419
your amp is forced by default you won't

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,590
have a you won't have at the end of the

00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:13,110
URL you want to fall

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:16,169
slash EMP so it's hard to identify if

00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,480
you run away and website error reporting

00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,820
using the validation tool as well by

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,070
default it removes our validation errors

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,570
but you can of course choose you need to

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,789
keep some of that functionality that

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,860
doesn't work it out the only thing is

00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:31,679
that that page that has that

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,150
functionality won't be amp valid which

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,210
is fine you're still using an app

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:39,120
website you still evaluate all your URLs

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:43,649
or amp and it's amp ID thought only one

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,380
version of your website so here you see

00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:47,850
what the validation tool looks like so

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,919
you were saying you're building plugins

00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,809
it would list all the invalid attributes

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,299
of tap login and tell you exactly the

00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,309
function or the different aspects that

00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,190
don't work in amp so you can kind of

00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:01,289
work with it that way and it does two

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,960
different features today validation tool

00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:05,460
to the URL index and error index and a

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,039
lot of people like if you've tested it

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,260
and you see it's showing 100 errors

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,880
those 100 errors might relate to just

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,440
one plug-in and doesn't mean that

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,990
certainly doesn't mean that plugins

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,899
built bad but it means that that plug-in

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,880
has is appearing on 100 URLs on your

00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,890
website so it might look frightening but

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,770
really could just be one quick fix or

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,740
one program so it has lied by reporting

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,899
in the admin yeah in the dashboard and

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,539
pinpoints the offending plug in our

00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:36,750
content it also provides a link to that

00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:39,720
exact code or function so you can see or

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,100
if you're a developer you can debug and

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:46,590
also you also have the option to remove

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:50,309
or keep all these validation errors for

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,260
to be a 100% ballot and document yes you

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:54,539
can still have an amp website but unless

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,130
it's 100% valid it won't be served from

00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,309
cache and you won't get all the features

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,289
all the benefits that amp brings I knew

00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:05,360
it it's still low the website was still

00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,360
load it just won't be 100% I'm valid

00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,030
it depends you might have 20 plugins in

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,240
your WordPress website five of them

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:22,730
might not working out so and I'm pony

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,860
really as if on the front end

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,290
I'm it's runny errors on the front end

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,090
they cook in such as SEO plugins you

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,890
won't its nightly you find any

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,220
validation errors with them I use Yoast

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,930
and some of my websites it's fine and

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,460
rank math so you won't see validation

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,760
errors for plugins to operate in the

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,530
background so it's just front-end

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,080
features really it slideshows or stuff

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,300
that appears in front end and the reason

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,950
I became about was about performance

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,780
improving performance so usually that's

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:54,740
do the front end whatever happens in the

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,660
dashboard is no problem so I'm it's all

00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,060
about page speeds and I don't have been

00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,010
familiar with lighthouse technology it's

00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,870
PageSpeed insights it's built with

00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,880
lighthouse technology and if you use

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,460
chrome dev tools there's little feature

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,590
within dev tools and the audit tab you

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,820
can do a speed test on your website so

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,980
if you do implement amp

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,410
always perform speed tests you don't

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,300
have to go to web dev or any off-site

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,850
websites you can do it within chrome and

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,710
it's lighters technology built into

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,580
chrome so it's much easier than you

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,560
think

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,810
to implement them if you're using

00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,940
compatible themes if using public

00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:33,110
plugins chances are you're not going to

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,810
fall into any development issues or look

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,760
for help there's lots of themes lots of

00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,140
plugins out there so it's just have that

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,520
mindset if you're thinking about

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,530
revamping your website or you're

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,890
thinking about building a new website if

00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,420
it can be on why not make it BM there's

00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,280
going to be much faster you're going to

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,050
get it use of almost free see the end

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,060
and you're going to get prioritized

00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,470
content on Google News you're going to

00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,290
get parodist content on lots of apps

00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,790
like Flipboard so if it's possible to go

00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,980
out find out there's no reason not to

00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,600
use amp and if there is mixed about amp

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,850
as well I'm sure some of you might have

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,470
heard so feel free to ask me and I'll go

00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,320
to a couple of them as well at the end

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,390
and at the components of brilliant you

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,460
really don't need to use as much

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,920
spend time making your own jQuery of

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,660
JavaScript features to free to use and

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,910
just test them with the amp that they've

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,440
the playground feature is just it's

00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:25,130
really good for using accordions and

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,470
stuff like that so who's using amp and

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,240
there's a little icon there's jump icon

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,890
in general when you do a search in your

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,700
mobile in particular you'll see the

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,250
important

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,900
you're always landing on an amp page you

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,300
might not be aware of it but a quick way

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,060
of using it the am father is a plugin

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,850
it's a Chrome extension our plugin so if

00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,920
you have the Chrome extension I'm father

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,450
really useful because when you visit

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,050
website you'll know about the color of

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,610
the icon

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:53,990
whether you're when you're not when

00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,970
you're on an app web site that'll be

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,810
green you can even click on it to see

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,310
any debug errors or it's just really

00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,780
useful when you visit the website to be

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,610
aware of whether you're in your hamper

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,460
website and our news publishers are

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,500
using app if you go into BBC the garden

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,290
it's very unlikely any news publisher

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,880
and a big player is not using amp it's

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,350
just you might not be aware of it if you

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,090
use the amp validator it's just really

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:22,280
cool for testing who's using amp so i'm

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,780
stories i'll just briefly run i'm

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,820
stories because it does tie in with user

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:30,110
first websites show you're all familiar

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:32,390
with instagram snapchat so amp stories

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:36,170
and amp email there are extensions to

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:38,450
the amp project i'm stories is an open

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,540
web version of building these stories

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,280
and different the difference with amp

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,230
stories compared to instagram stories

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,600
you own the contents you can monetize

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:51,350
the content they're built with just HTML

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,180
CSS javascript and yeah the stories

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,370
don't expire they're just a URL within

00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,380
your own website you can import them you

00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,840
can export them and people say sometimes

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,760
why would i use an amp story but if you

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,860
have a typical post or a blog post and

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,470
you want to engage new audience who

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,690
don't like reading too much you could

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:12,230
have just underneath the title you could

00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,930
have read this in story format so people

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,580
can just swipe through on the phone look

00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,110
at the images read the text under each

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,970
story and just in the same way as

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,070
instagram but it's a URL within your

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,279
website so people can either read your

00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,369
car

00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:28,070
I just read an digested in story format

00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:30,289
and also there's going to be we're

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,999
working hard on a feature in Google

00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:33,259
search as well there's going to be all

00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:35,389
visual stories as well

00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:37,009
same way as you'd see in images or

00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:38,450
videos and it's just going to highlight

00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:40,309
all the different stories available out

00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,700
there so it's a good time to learn about

00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:45,469
our stories as well and with the

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,960
official plugin at the moment there's a

00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:50,119
beta version of stories it's baked into

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,369
the existing am plugin it's eventually

00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,919
going to be its own amp stories plugin

00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:56,479
for WordPress but it's built using the

00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,279
Gutenberg wave so if you're familiar

00:27:56,479 --> 00:28:00,259
using building blocks that's worth

00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,539
testing out stories and lots of people

00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:04,969
are already using it but just for a

00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:06,589
future-proof way of engaging in new

00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:10,909
audience i'm stories could be really

00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:13,009
useful so if any of any questions i'll

00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:14,809
just go through feel free to ask I'll go

00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:16,460
through a few the most common questions

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:19,999
I get daily dealing with publishers or

00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,859
at events so how am i how would I use am

00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,369
stories on my website so like I just

00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,159
mentioned

00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:28,519
below the title or maybe it's the first

00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,499
paragraph view this blog post in story

00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:31,669
format you'd be surprised how well it

00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:33,440
works and because you control

00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:35,779
monetization you can put ads in those

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,399
stories drawer limitations but you could

00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:38,690
also put analytics and track how many

00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,940
people have clicked a button how many

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,580
people have read that story and as well

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,799
as that the story don't expire so you

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,239
make a nice story of the event here

00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:49,249
today that the guy is doing a great job

00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:51,019
of it doesn't expire next year you can

00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:52,789
go back and see just swipe to see here

00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:56,259
today went so if you're writing a blog

00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,259
post just test out stories

00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:05,810
I suppose tick-tock tomorrow video

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,430
stories kind of hits away to it hold

00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,260
January most people host him on your own

00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,360
website and they tie in with whether you

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,940
create a new blog post tic toc is more

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,350
about videos and tic toc is great but at

00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,090
the same time they control everything on

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,250
that platform when you make an app store

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,980
you can export that into a zip file and

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,660
it's just HTML CSS JavaScript so it's

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,950
completely different it's open web and

00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,540
you took the money the limitations of

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,700
Instagram stories YouTube stories so

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,560
lots of the it's just the open web way

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,560
that you control your own story and

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,690
doesn't expire lot of people also say

00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,060
this does implementing amp does it

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,890
affect my SEO so the short answer that

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,230
is no it's not going to help your SEO

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,870
it's not going to hinder your SEO but

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,570
one thing i always tell people is if you

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,460
go 100% amp it means your website is

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,100
going to be super fast by default and

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:58,640
speed is a factor in google search and

00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:01,180
rankings so if you do go 100% down it

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,040
can give you a boost put out on its own

00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,290
if you have amp running alongside non

00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,480
amp its yourn on our website that's it

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,430
one gets considered for indexing so

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,020
don't think if you have read a more

00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,960
transitional mode you're going to get a

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,720
boost in google search it's not going to

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,120
give you that boost so we touched on

00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,500
validation errors what options do we

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,720
have what can I do if I see a lot of

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,430
validation errors on amp so you can use

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,100
components and places or plugins

00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,510
preferably keep using your plugins to

00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,700
talk with the developers or if you're

00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,200
able to debug any of the errors because

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,210
I'm paying the lots of work components

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,280
can help you with any JavaScript errors

00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,830
so yeah it's lots of ways to get around

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,900
validation errors debug yourself contact

00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:45,470
developer or using an amp component

00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,660
instead it possible and some resources

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,940
are like to share I'm def is the amp

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,830
project website the playground is where

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,330
you can test out lots of the different

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:56,150
components how am I fit in with your

00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:58,580
website if you want an FAQ style with

00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,480
you want FAQ is near website a nice

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,080
accordion style

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,660
there's components to do that - w.org

00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,200
it's a plug-in website if you build your

00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,140
own if you build your own amp website

00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,470
you can submit

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,840
website for inclusion so feel free to

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,640
submit your own site and web dev it's

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,290
just a way of comparing performance so

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,000
if you don't use chrome dev tools and

00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,400
the light hook lighthouse technology

00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,080
build in the dev tools you can use web

00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,960
dev it's just an easy way to test

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,430
website performance so I was tested when

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,430
you create a website compare the

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,600
performance and also bear in mind your

00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,310
performance will be increased even

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,260
further when it's served when your

00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,940
content is served from amp cache so

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:42,210
there is a difference in amp cache and

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,200
amplify origin so and I don't have a

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,090
link here because it's a Chrome

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,130
extension but definitely check out the

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:49,290
am validator Chrome extension it just

00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,350
identifies when you're on an amp website

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:54,030
and also a lists on for your own website

00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,740
will list any validation errors under

00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:01,740
the debugging feature of the Chrome

00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:03,570
extension as well I'm not sure actually

00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,910
I don't use Firefox to moistures for

00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:09,090
development but I'm not sure there might

00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:11,010
be and last slide I'm going to talk

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:14,160
about site kit is no programming for

00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:16,950
Carden and we released late last year

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,380
and it just builds lots of different

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:22,980
Google products search console and latex

00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,780
adsense PageSpeed insights tag manager

00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,740
and optimize all into one WordPress

00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:30,750
plug-in how many of you use Sai kit know

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:36,300
are you happier so you'll find it how do

00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:38,630
you find that before it yeah exactly

00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,620
and if you have a WordPress website it's

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,350
something we've worked really hard on

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,630
board I'm gonna obviously I'm biased but

00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,250
it's a very plugin you don't need to go

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,070
to search console to submit your website

00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,840
you don't need to go to analytics even

00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,850
add census it can submit your website

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,950
for inclusion on the Adsense Network and

00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,420
all within the same dashboard you can

00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,580
see how many visitors you've had over

00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,430
the last seven days areas of improvement

00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,100
you can check your page speed so it's a

00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,870
really cool plugin and like I said I

00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,830
might be biased but feel free to give it

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:12,210
a try and psych it and that's more or

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,680
less tips do you come sure some of you

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,680
have questions as I'm busy

00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,079
[Applause]

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:55,720
well the good thing about the official

00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:58,390
amp program it converts so when you talk

00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,880
about different tags it's on page 2 ml

00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,110
that has its own like image amp image so

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,880
you don't need to do anything to make

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,650
your if there's validation errors

00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,810
certainly fixed validation errors but

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,820
the amp plugin converts if you have if

00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:13,780
your plugin has features to end up on a

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,929
user's front-end HTML the am plugin

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,330
converts all regular HTML into amp HTML

00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,830
so the plug-in does all the hard work so

00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,560
it's just a few JavaScript or other

00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:26,710
features you might need to use unbind or

00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,300
a workaround just a fallback for amp but

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,190
generally if it's just some features

00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,110
that add some HTML in front end if your

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,399
website you only need to worry but if

00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,560
you install the plug-in and test the

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,590
validation to the test validation

00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:42,220
feature of the plug-in it will tell you

00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:44,230
so and it is worth it because people are

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:47,020
out there looking for non developers

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,310
might be looking for plugins and because

00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,830
they're using plugins that don't work in

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,929
amp so it's a good time to maybe make

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,510
especially for developer might be super

00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,770
easy to make you're talking about and I

00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,400
could we bring a new audience who are

00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,400
looking for that

00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:15,849
a good question

00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:18,619
it goes stale after I think it's really

00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:20,300
it works differently than a regular cash

00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:23,359
so basically if a new visit and nine

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,740
website it's cached again so this web

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,609
visit the website after you it's

00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:30,320
constantly being refreshed so it's

00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:32,839
exactly so it's very unlikely you access

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,910
a website that's that's not going to be

00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,440
up to date it's very unlikely and at the

00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,079
same time even if you don't get much

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,510
traffic I camera the exact refresh

00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,849
periods before go stale and it's fetched

00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:53,420
again but it's on dia it's on the Google

00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:55,640
developer website yeah okay so test out

00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,950
the amp plugin and like I said just as a

00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,420
wrapper if you are using especially a

00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,070
wordpress poor theme or themes that

00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,869
support um there's no reason why you

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,740
shouldn't be using amp even if it's in

00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,270
transitional mode

00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,980
just compare the difference because it

00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:09,829
can make a difference speed is a factor

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:12,260
on is that just lots of benefits of amp

00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:14,460
so if you can use on to no reason not to

00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:20,349
use it okay

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,349
