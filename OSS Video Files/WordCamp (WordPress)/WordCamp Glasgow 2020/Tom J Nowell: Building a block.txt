Publication date: 2020-04-27
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	Letâ€™s build a Gutenberg block! Tom will cover building a basic block in javascript, and in PHP. A great opportunity to refresh on the basics and lay a solid foundation. Suitable for intermediate developers.

the Gutenberg is it's the walk based

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,320
built building editor in WordPress and

00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,630
don't know from human-made who does some

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,680
absolutely amazing things with Gutenberg

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:25,890
walks and if I get this right it takes a

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:27,869
second hey thankfully I've been in

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,699
Schuster I'm Tom you may remember me

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,219
from such previous films as web Camp

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,620
Edinburgh and London and various other

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,100
things and if not hello nice to meet you

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,110
lovely to be here so I'm gonna talk

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,690
about building blocks and I'm gonna aim

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,020
directing it at the bottom end of the

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,850
scale learning them completely from

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,379
scratch I'm not going to go into

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,870
advanced blocks you won't be learning

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,460
how to build the Taj Mahal or the Eiffel

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,379
Tower we're just going to go with the

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,770
really basics to kind of make sure that

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,280
the foundations are in there so building

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,230
blocks

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,300
hopefully it's very nice title and

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,070
that's what could tiny little bit about

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,909
Gutenberg and maybe a little bit of what

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:12,630
I see going forward so as most of you

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,549
aware there are blocks and for a long

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,220
time has been various different forms of

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,009
content in WordPress you have your post

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,130
content and have your widgets you have

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,439
your short codes you have your ACF

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,600
fields and other things by various

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,369
plugins and frameworks and post-metal

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,009
options and you have boxes in the

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,380
options page and you have theme arts and

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,970
you have - Dashboard widgets with

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,890
various other things and then you have

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,840
network sites and then you can pull

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,200
things from other sites and it's just

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,970
available I was doing a article and I

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
had a big word grid where had every

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,829
possible type of content along the left

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,659
and loads of things like how do you

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,399
access it can you have more than one of

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,229
them and that it was a really big table

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,350
and to be honest I don't remember half

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,759
it I don't expect anyone else does like

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,670
did you know attachments can have

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,210
comments you can yeah so we have all

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,429
these hundred and one

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,800
tons of different kinds of contents and

00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,150
they all have different interfaces and

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,970
some of them have multiple interfaces

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,830
and some of them are old and some of

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,569
them are new and some of them have

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,310
multiple into places but then you

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,810
probably used a plugin that adds a

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,340
completely different interface so that

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,310
you can drag and drop them in order

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,190
it's a nightmare and we have this new

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,800
block editor and you might think that's

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,780
yet another interface why should I

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,170
bother with that I have my short codes

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,150
and I have my widgets I know in the past

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,709
I have decided to abandon it all and

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,390
just use widgets inside bars for

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,459
everything can no that's another story

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,140
but we have blocks

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,300
what makes that difference and why

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,640
should I be bothered about it I mean

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,530
some of you probably have some Inklings

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,910
like well it's the newfangled thing and

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,590
you know I can charge a bit more to

00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,660
clients maybe with these fancy new

00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,920
blocks and youing editors and interfaces

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,269
but I'm not going to tell you how to

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,769
make the fancy ones y'all have to come

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:08,080
to my next talk for that so blocks are

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:10,600
the interface and when I say that I mean

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,940
in the future everything will be a block

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,160
now it might be that underneath this

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,500
behind the scenes that block is backed

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,959
by one of the older things it might be

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,910
that there's some plumbing behind the

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,060
scenes that plugs into a widget or a

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:28,959
shortcode or it might be just a block

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,340
block at the end of the day when you're

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,400
using WordPress you're gonna see this

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,100
interface and so you kind of need to

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,410
plan ahead and think of things in that

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,910
point of view and so I think it's really

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,630
important to be able to just build the

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,820
really basic block and when I say basic

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,450
I mean I'm talking like the hello world

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,280
kind of thing so you see people who have

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,410
short codes for example and you know

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,810
they add their function in it it echoes

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,880
hello world or returns hello world and

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,739
then depending on which option they went

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,450
they would realize I did a good job what

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:05,590
why isn't it working how I expected so

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,480
going forward you need to sort of think

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,230
about things in those terms be at the

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,269
paradigm but this is kind of like the

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,609
archetype of block that's a paragraph

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,620
block I has a few things about it so

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,930
you've got your main content area in the

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,530
middle

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,360
here you have your site mover about two

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,030
things there and you have your toolbar

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,660
there and a great thing to change it

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,580
into something else and really we want

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,400
to build something that has maybe not as

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,530
much complexity as this is that has a

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,210
lot of options in a block that you

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,789
wouldn't need from these things like we

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,580
don't need to make our hello world bold

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,080
or italic or justifiable and we don't

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,639
know what we're going to put it up

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,460
because we have a lot of different

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,930
things we could do lots of potential of

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,949
things so the two main first I'm going

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,940
to go over today

00:04:54,949 --> 00:05:02,599
there's the JavaScript bikes block and

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:06,490
then there's the more PHP oriented base

00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:08,780
block so depending on what you prefer

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,150
you can get to pick and choose one I

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,000
know that personally I feel that the

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,199
most innovative and the most room to

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,759
grow is with JavaScript based blocks but

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,560
that doesn't mean that you can't use PHP

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,060
to build a lot of it and it can't

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,229
doesn't mean that you can't mix and

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:29,810
match so let's build a very very basic

00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,970
hello world and this is just gonna be

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,860
one single code snippet on the screen

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,500
and I'm gonna walk through what each

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,139
line means it's gonna be entirely in

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,590
JavaScript and all it will do is say

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:49,699
hello world so it's the simplest you

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:53,659
could get so to register create a block

00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:55,729
mean register it that's the register

00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:59,810
block type we give it a name some

00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:02,090
information and two functions so you may

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,449
have encountered it in the past but very

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:08,180
few people were really aware of it in

00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:10,639
JavaScript there is a Ming WP object and

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,590
hanging off of that is a place for all

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,659
of the random WordPress stuff that lives

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,060
in WordPress those JavaScript related

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:19,520
live so there's a lot of things under

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,480
there datastore some things that make it

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,770
easy to work with the REST API

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,870
and all of that but we're not going to

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,220
talk about that day but if you want to

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,170
be searched up that's just something to

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,440
note down for the future but we're

00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,390
looking at blocks so there's a nice WP

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,950
blocks bit and it has a function that

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,810
lets you register different kinds of

00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,150
blocks and the first parameter is

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,670
basically sort of like the internal name

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,580
so you know if you register a custom

00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:47,580
post type or taxonomy or it will have

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,410
like the fancy human name and then it

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,810
will have sort of like the internal name

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,990
so there's like post all lowercase

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:58,200
versus post of a capital P or translated

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,850
into French or German and I realize I

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,520
didn't speak any of these languages so I

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,980
don't have examples but or if you're

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,550
doing a post you would like literally

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,770
taking in a post you've got like an the

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,600
really nice one that appears as a title

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,460
but then you also have like the post

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,560
slug which appears in the URL this is

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,080
kind of similar to that and you'll

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,270
notice it's named space so I have Tom GN

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,430
forward slash hello world cuz you might

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,680
want to make your own hello world walk

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,380
and you want to be able to compare them

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,290
side-by-side and see how a fish - okay I

00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,000
don't know so that's generally the

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,950
convention you'll put a name space that

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,380
might be a company name it might be your

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,180
name it might be my name please don't

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,720
use my name and then the name of your

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,890
block and then you give it an object

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,680
which of these little squiggly bits here

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:52,980
and it has some parameters basically

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,960
telling Gutenberg all about the spot so

00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,170
some of them are pretty straightforward

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,750
like the title so hello world pretty

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:03,060
straightforward as I'm going around and

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,040
the interface that will appear or say

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,230
hello world and the inserter where I've

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,540
got to choose small blocks if I hover

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,910
over it it will say hello world and a

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,160
little snippet on the side and it'll say

00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,810
hello world in the sidebar as well when

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm clicking on the block and it gives

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:26,040
me more options the icon universal

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:29,460
access alt that is - icons so whenever I

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,230
go to insert that block you'll have it

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,810
in the list and it will use the icon

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,880
that maps

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,890
to that name and there's some really

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,469
useful websites you can go to which

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,479
basically have all of them list it out

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,219
and you can just click on one and it

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,190
will give you a handful of things that I

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,380
would give you the CSS for it the SVG or

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,210
just even just a name and there's lots

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,690
of different ways you can use those like

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,700
sidebar menus in the admin but that's

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,060
another topic not getting to that and

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,380
the category you know when you click on

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,450
the insert and it has the little

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,490
sections that collapse you start with

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,980
most-used and then they have like the

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,350
formatting and the images and the layout

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,660
this basically just where that goes in

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,460
you can add your own but you have to

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,200
tell it in advance that that cattle

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,800
could be exists but we won't get into

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,170
that today

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,110
as I say we just want to focus on the

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,570
basic block first and then maybe go an

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,850
extra step or two beyond that and then

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,370
there's two functions and this is kind

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,070
of the meat of things this is what

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,040
really makes it work so there's an edit

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,450
and a save I know some people when they

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,030
first get into this thing muddled them

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:40,690
up a little bit and that's why I have

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:42,970
them different so when the block editor

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,490
looks at your block and it's like okay I

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,920
have two jobs I need to save it to the

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,360
database at some point and I need to

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,610
show it to the user because they want to

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,500
know what they're editing the Edit

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,040
function is the bit that you see in the

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,170
block editor so if I launch off my block

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
now and I register and they go into the

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,010
block editor and I try and add this

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,820
hello world block I will see hello world

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:10,380
from the editor but when I save it I

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,900
will see hello world from the front-end

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,000
and in very simplistic terms that's

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,339
pretty much all there is to a block I

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,200
can return something a bit more

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:23,380
complicated than this if I really want

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,420
to with more elements more tags and so

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,670
on and so forth but that's all I really

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:32,880
need in terms of the Edit and

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,710
the save some people when they heard

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,270
about the block editor and I heard it

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,340
was built in react

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:41,760
therefore all our blocks have to be

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,590
react now and all our fiends have to be

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,530
react and all our front end has to be

00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:49,430
react it's like no react is very useful

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,660
to know but it's not necessary to know

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,450
because this is a really simple example

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,830
I guess in this case they could have

00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,780
just returned the string hello world

00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,420
from the editor and not even bothered

00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,330
with any tags but that wouldn't be very

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,420
useful in the long run so if I wanted in

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,400
my block to have little drop downs or a

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,770
button that the user could press and

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,560
interact with I will put it in this edit

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,020
function that's kind of like my little

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,120
mini JavaScript app that implements all

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,840
the little toggles and dials and things

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,670
like that and the save is just what it

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,330
generates right at the end it gets into

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:30,420
the database it's just pure static HTML

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:32,820
and what gets done with that on the

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,400
front end is up to the front end that's

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,560
totally separate so if I want to build a

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,210
block that has a react front-end I need

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,360
to then go on the front-end and build a

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:45,420
react application that takes in the HTML

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,120
of saved here or I can just output HTML

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,290
that's what most of the core parts do

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,300
it's sort of how they want it there are

00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,930
other things that you can add in this

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,570
list like this block to know me be

00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,900
inside this of a block or this block

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,880
cannot be deleted or this block when you

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,240
create it usually has these things or

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,220
attributes but we'll get to that another

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,000
time and there's lots of really good

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,240
documentation about that so this is what

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,060
that looks as you can see I pick the

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,090
layout category and there is in layout

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:24,900
elements I had a title of hello world

00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:27,960
and icon of universal access alt and

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,020
that's what that icon looks like and the

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,700
other blocks use very similar methods

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,590
but that's basically the gist of that

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,250
and if we look over to what it actually

00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,250
looks like

00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:44,929
well it looks like a new front end but

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:47,839
that's football so that's JavaScript I'm

00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:49,939
usually working in PHP Bo and although I

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,069
really like to try and do things of

00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,350
react and push myself forward with

00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:56,839
JavaScript I know but that's something

00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,809
I've been doing in the last 2 or so

00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,850
years and for the last 10 years I've

00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:04,519
been doing PHP I know a lot better and

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,470
most of my stuff is already in PHP why

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,059
can't I ease down instead I have all

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,309
these shortcodes I want to transfer two

00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,929
blocks why can't I don't want to have to

00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:18,410
rebuild those in JavaScript

00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:20,899
I don't have to so I have two parts

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,139
there's a JavaScript pot and a PHP pot

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,850
with the idea being I extend a PHP parts

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,399
and it relies on something called

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,959
server-side rendering so there's a

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,980
server-side rendering component you can

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:36,649
put into the bit in the Edit bit and

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,649
then it goes and calls in PHP via the

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,419
REST API and at that point you're back

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:44,629
in PHP land and you have a just a

00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:46,429
function that returns a string and you

00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:48,619
can put whatever you want in it so in

00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:52,309
this case this is the bit that actually

00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:54,379
displays my block and I could copy paste

00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:57,379
my code from my short code into there I

00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:59,389
could create a few objects into a great

00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,069
big MVC symfony laravel thing if I

00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,859
really want to I could Lou twig

00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:05,809
templates I could make an API call to

00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:08,299
some other random server that I have

00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:10,549
that was you know the customer had some

00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:12,949
other provider or whatever and display

00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:15,980
that I don't know it's PHP as long as I

00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:18,619
return a string with some HTML it should

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,910
be fine in this case I've chosen hello

00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:22,220
world because sounds simple and I don't

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,899
really like having lots of contents and

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,230
before I get really manly and waffling

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:29,029
and you have two things there's the

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,009
attributes which we don't have any

00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:34,039
attributes in this block but if I were

00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:36,289
to have like a little toggle or a box or

00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,049
drop-down that's where what those would

00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:40,489
be like my parameters or like the

00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:43,020
attributes when you have a short code

00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:46,740
callback or the pop

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:50,010
and a widget and the content if I have a

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,170
block let's say like the color block or

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:55,800
the group block you can put stuff inside

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,660
it that's basically the content so in

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,050
this case I'm just returning hello world

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,320
and then I have a nice little sort of

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,020
bootstrapping thing so to tell it that

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,930
I've done something in PHP I can call

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:13,140
register block type and again this time

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,780
because I'm doing a dynamic block using

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,180
rendering the server I've decided to

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,660
call it Tom Jen for it / dynamic because

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:25,170
I'm very imaginative and it needs two

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,420
things specifically it needs to know

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,480
what function to call to actually show

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,510
the block so vendor Tom's block with

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,480
this nice little bit at the top and it

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,190
wants a script to register so that it

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,350
knows a few of the other things like

00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,300
which category it is and what it's

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:46,650
called on the front end and the icon to

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,240
use so I register my script and I'm

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,070
calling it block j s just because I'm

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,490
not very imaginative and I have a nice

00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:57,150
block Jess file in my plug-in and then I

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,800
have two dependencies WP blocks because

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,630
it needs to know where to get that WP

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,090
blocks bit I showed you earlier thumb

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,220
and WP element because that's an

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,540
important part of things if you don't

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,940
include those you'll probably get a

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,640
cryptic javascript error in which case

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,600
it's usually easy just to have those

00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:18,300
things in so I'll start with that and it

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,150
runs on in it so on every page load it

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:24,000
tells WordPress I need to register a

00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,830
javascript file on my plug-in pretty

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,290
standard not getting very specific

00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:31,740
really then I need to register a block

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:35,000
type it's a dynamic block when that

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:39,300
block is shown call that function and

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,270
register in key that one nests all the

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,360
PHP so far and then have a little bit of

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,610
JavaScript which is very similar it's a

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,940
dynamic block I opted for a megaphone

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,380
instead of an accessibility icon and

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,120
I've put it in the widgets category

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,930
because therefore

00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:01,490
do they ever change I've also decided to

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:07,750
change the edit and the save functions a

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:09,980
little bit so if I go forward

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:17,000
there's my dynamic block with its

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:19,339
megaphone never insert it so I don't

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,260
need to change some things so this is my

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,980
new edit function from before

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:27,350
I'm just saying on the server there is a

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:32,059
block Tom Jen dynamic and if I have any

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:35,090
attributes pass them along and that's

00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:36,800
what it will look like now that hello

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,590
world isn't coming from JavaScript it's

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,240
coming from the server and the PHP and

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,700
that little function that just returns

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,070
to the words hello world alright put

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,600
whatever I want in there and it would do

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,750
that and it would do it on the front end

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,030
as well if I try and interact this I can

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,590
move it around like a normal block the

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,120
only thing I would note is every now and

00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,620
again it might look like a great block

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,190
of a little spinner and that's just

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,830
WordPress going back to the PHP and

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,660
checking you know what's it supposed to

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,640
look like because it can't do that in

00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,490
JavaScript it has to go back to my PHP

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,350
function so it has to make a request but

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,350
that usually takes like a second

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,740
and that's what it looks like on the

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,389
front end kind of just looks like a

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,769
paragraph because I wasn't especially

00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:27,029
imaginative when I built my block but

00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:29,370
every time i refresh that it will

00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:33,269
generate that on the fly a bit like a

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:35,190
shortcode but it's a block and I could

00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:38,429
put all sorts of fancy things in there I

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,679
could put a great big embed that

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:42,899
generated things in PHP based on another

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,730
database table so I've seen some people

00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:46,380
use short codes for I could put a

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,000
snippet of code which I know will never

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,830
change and I don't the client to mess

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,630
around with it so I'm gonna make it into

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,909
a block and just put it in a PHP

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,909
function I could do all sorts make sure

00:18:53,909 --> 00:19:03,659
you have imaginations but I mean I like

00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:05,490
the words hello world sometimes though

00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:10,169
you need to sort of nest things into

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:12,840
each other and in this case this is kind

00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:14,880
of similar to like group blocks so cover

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,889
blocks where you can click inside it and

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,409
then add more paragraphs and images and

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:26,039
so on and so forth or or columns columns

00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:27,590
is a good example and you can do this so

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,179
I need to make a handful of changes

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:33,720
first I need to tell it to actually

00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:35,279
display the inner blocks so just because

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,590
I have a block and I know it has like

00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,809
contents inside it doesn't mean that the

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,059
block editor knows that well it kind of

00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:46,380
knows in the data but it can't show it

00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:49,110
to you so we need to add this small bit

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,779
at the end just to stay after we've done

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:54,750
our service server render with the PHP

00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,450
we can then put in a blocks in there and

00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:01,889
we also need to tell it up here this is

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:05,279
what inner blocks is so those two lines

00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:07,110
are the new bits and if you just want to

00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,549
build a simple single block that doesn't

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,970
have any children you don't need to do

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:14,519
this but if you wanted to have children

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,500
this would be how you would do that then

00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,929
we may have to modify or save function

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,820
so there Ashley saves those init blocks

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,539
as well so we just tell it take the

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,090
content

00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:28,499
all the child blocks and that's what

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:30,539
you're going to state I've modified my

00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:32,850
PHP function to actually use the

00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:35,669
contents so it's not just hello world

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:39,710
anymore it's other stuff as well and

00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:43,049
that's just appending me on the end and

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,289
then when I register it I also need to

00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:47,840
add WP block editor in the middle there

00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:50,279
just so it knows what the block editor

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:55,649
variable is and it loads it at the

00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:57,359
correct point and that will generate

00:20:55,649 --> 00:21:01,109
something that can put things on the

00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:03,359
inside but if you don't want to copy

00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:06,299
paste all of these things or type it up

00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,220
from my slides or go in and try and

00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,019
figure out exactly how to structure this

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,940
and you just wanted to start putting in

00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,909
the stuff there are other ways of

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,269
generating blocks and if you have WP CLI

00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:21,470
you can run a command that will just

00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:24,629
spit out something that works for you so

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,669
instead of writing all these PHP files

00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:30,149
and JavaScript files you can just build

00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:33,470
stuff in so they call this scaffolding

00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:35,729
and WP steel is a few ways of

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,769
scaffolding things you can tell it to

00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:39,539
scaffold a theme and it will give you a

00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:42,690
nice empty fiend that doesn't do

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:44,820
anything with an index.php and so on and

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,619
so forth and you can scaffold the

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,720
plug-in as well so you don't have to go

00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:51,059
in and create a folder and create a

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,859
plug-in file and add the little header

00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,629
at the top at the comments you can just

00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:57,210
tell it I want to plug-in and it's

00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:58,739
called this and this is its name and

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,389
this is an author and it will go ahead

00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:02,340
and fill up some things

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:05,340
it might even ask you a question if you

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,950
forgot to add a parameter but you can

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,210
also do this with blocks which I'm

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,489
pretty good because it used to be the

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,950
case that you had to use this NPM npx

00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:15,960
create start a block thing and I'm like

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,909
I never really trust those they always

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,039
have a way too much additional stuff

00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:22,440
it's like when you first get into react

00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:25,409
and they say he's create map we have to

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,310
start a thing and you end up with a URL

00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:29,080
looter and a validation

00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,570
in a datastore it's like no I just

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,670
wanted to do a hello world so I could

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,120
learn the basics and now I'm stuck with

00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:39,640
five thousand lines of code say there's

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,520
a command that will generate it all from

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:46,260
scratch for you

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:49,080
hands up who is aware of what WPC is and

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:54,760
who would like me to explain what it is

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:57,100
okay so usually when you're working with

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,310
WordPress to using the point-and-click

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,770
visual user interface in your browser

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:05,410
and that's all fine and good and some

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,690
people might then want to do other stuff

00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:11,020
so they might write a little PHP script

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:13,450
that will publish 5,000 posts because

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:17,050
they don't want to click 5,000 times or

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,910
they might go and use PHP myadmin to

00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,220
look up the poster that they can write a

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:24,850
query that would be a little difficult

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:27,040
to search for in WordPress or maybe they

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,780
just want to do a lot of things but they

00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,810
don't have the time to go and do it a

00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,210
hundred times or they want to do it in a

00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:38,290
way they can pipe into another command

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:41,080
somewhere so if I had a command prompt

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,750
or a terminal there is a WP command and

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,450
you just type WP and then you type a sub

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:49,090
command and some information about what

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:52,060
you want so it's probably best I just

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:58,330
show you so this is what it would take

00:23:52,060 --> 00:24:01,780
to scaffold a movie block and then put

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:04,450
it in a plug-in called movies so I would

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,910
open a command prompt and I would if I

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,450
had WPC I installed go to my WordPress

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:13,180
install and type Dodie be scaffold block

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,370
movie where movie is like the internal

00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,010
name before that I mentioned like Tom

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:21,940
gin forward slash hello world or Tom

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:25,180
gen4 / dynamic the title being what the

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,160
user would see on the front end and - -

00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,710
plug in equals movies basically says put

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,330
it in and plug in called movies and

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,570
it'll go up and it will do that and

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:37,570
it'll generate a few things so in this

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,430
case I'll quit a few files

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:43,000
created the movies folder and the box

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:46,330
folder and it's given you a movie PHP

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,910
which does all of the this discharge -

00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,710
it here and this script here and we need

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,930
to connect them all up and put them on

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,570
the block editor and cue them at the

00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:59,050
same time and all of that jazz then

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,450
there's a editor dot CSS to style it

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,940
while it's in the block editor and a

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:07,030
style of CSS for when that block appears

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,640
on the front end so you might choose to

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:13,150
have them be the same file with the same

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,390
contents or you might decide to let's

00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,100
say add extra padding around area so

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,390
they're easier to click on an edit when

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,860
they're in the block editor but that

00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,220
doesn't appear on the front end just

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:27,040
those minor usability and quality of

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,890
life tweaks or just things to help

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,860
people as they're going around and the

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,690
block is is a JavaScript block it

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,450
doesn't do them very much it has a

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:40,690
little bit more than my example and it

00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:43,240
had some extra parameters and it adds a

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,820
lot more comments the idea being that if

00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,350
you're not really sure about blocks and

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,200
you want to really dig into and learn

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,850
about things you can spend good ten

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,650
minutes twenty minutes reading through

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,420
that and just learn what each every

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,790
little bit all the nooks and crannies

00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:00,640
they're all nicely labeled and bounce

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,770
and the same with the other files and at

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,480
that point if in your plugin let's say

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,060
there was a movies forward slash plug

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,580
into PHP you could just include movie

00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,170
dot PHP go to the blog editor and

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,480
refresh and you would have a movies

00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,910
block you wouldn't do very much it would

00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,370
just say something along the lines of I

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,020
am on the editor when you're in the

00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,050
block editor and on the front end it's

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,400
say something like I am on the front end

00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:30,460
but at that point you would then start

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:33,550
backing away and changing things sir my

00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,860
name is Tom there's my twitter and my

00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,850
website I probably should lot more than

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:45,140
I do and

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:45,140
a lot of questions all right how's this

00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:54,170
so like that

00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,060
let's let's go all the way back until we

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,950
have a full example on the screen so

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:06,000
that I can explain without anything

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:09,330
being missing so you can't let's say I

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,310
was building this with react I could say

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:16,620
return and then just write the paragraph

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:19,110
type HTML but I know know everybody

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,570
knows much about react or how to take

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,700
that format the JavaScript and put it

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:27,030
into something that the browser would so

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,920
in this case these examples like this I

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,650
could just copy paste this into the

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,690
console with the block editor open and

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,820
then hey presto I would have a block I

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:57,360
wouldn't need to actually modify any

00:27:35,820 --> 00:28:00,480
files but when it comes to react and so

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,000
there's a few ways to work react and

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,460
WordPress just as there's a few ways to

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:12,470
work with react . there's one way which

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:16,110
is probably newer is dep scripts and

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,790
yeah that that's really useful and that

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,730
does a lot of things behind the scenes

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:23,160
as well for example if you have a

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,660
javascript file and it requires a few of

00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,910
the things it will kind of figure that

00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,490
out in advance they give you a key HP

00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:32,040
fowl so you just include that and it

00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,840
will list them all out love than you

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,840
having to manually list them out and it

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,560
will also do things like WP scripts

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,270
start and it will run alive

00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,400
or it will build things in the

00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:46,100
background so that's one way of doing it

00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,350
in the past I've used a web pack convict

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,720
and put a load of things in a pack and

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,730
by 1:00 p.m.

00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,620
yeah I've always tried to use webpack

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,450
whenever I can just because it's the

00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,370
thing that I've seen most commonly and

00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,530
it's the one that most and myself and my

00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,810
colleagues understand so it's just

00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,190
whatever you're comfortable with is what

00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,830
I would recommend but if you're unsure

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:10,730
web pack and order B P scripts is what I

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:14,090
would personally recommend if you work

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:17,930
with the WP CLI scaffold plug in values

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:20,840
just ready to go if you don't want to

00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:25,520
work with react technically as long as

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:29,780
whatever is returned by that is good to

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,700
be here yeah it's kind of like WordPress

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,250
this way of sort of wrapping around it

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,900
but without needing any extra step

00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:41,740
between writing the JavaScript and

00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:44,770
running it yeah so I mean in this case

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,510
technically that is still using react

00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:50,150
because the way that underneath several

00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:53,090
layers down and that's how it would be

00:29:50,150 --> 00:30:01,850
sort of compiled under the scenes for

00:29:53,090 --> 00:30:04,610
that sort of and I think one of the

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:07,160
thoughts is that underneath that layer

00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:10,310
you could turn it into something else

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,470
like a view or something else like in

00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:16,370
this case it doesn't have to be yell or

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:19,430
react it's whatever is returned by the

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:21,620
Edit function becomes what is in the

00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,360
editor and whatever is returned by the

00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:29,030
save function becomes what is in the

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:31,970
database so I think it was a very

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:35,890
roundabout way I think it was a very

00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,890
roundabout way of thinking saying yeah

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,240
me like I'm not 100% safe I'm not very

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,409
familiar with angular so I didn't see

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,480
why you wouldn't be able to build the

00:30:47,409 --> 00:31:13,659
necessary interface with angular for

00:30:49,480 --> 00:31:40,500
that block that yeah yeah and did you

00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:40,500
have a question so encountered up myself

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:47,590
of course never say never but the thing

00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:49,600
about doubly PCI scaffolding is it's

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,549
kind of just giving you a starting point

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,740
a bit like the underscore spoon

00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:55,690
you don't really necessarily worry but

00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,240
in the future WordPress will break the

00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,280
underscore thing because it's just like

00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,870
nobody actually uses it they just start

00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,020
with it and then it turns into what it

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,360
turns into and I would think that if

00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,000
you're facing an issue where you've

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,679
built something and it works right now

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,080
and it doesn't work in six months time

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,169
and something is kind of seriously

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,049
broken there but you can find out in

00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:21,940
advance with the guttenberg plug-in if

00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:23,559
that's gonna happen and make sure that

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,380
by the time the next word press release

00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,080
comes around that everything is okay I

00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,750
can found that whenever I've had issues

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,820
with Gutenberg maybe it's because I'm on

00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,590
a really odd system like I try to use it

00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:41,049
on a television with a little remote and

00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,640
if I raise an issue on the github repo

00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:44,700
they're usually pretty good about

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,320
responding and flagging and make

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,170
sure that it does actually go they do

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,910
get around to fixing it and if other

00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:52,320
people paddling with the same issue as

00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,990
they probably would if you're in that

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,090
situation then yeah it's probably gonna

00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:59,190
get more attention or maybe someone

00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,020
who's not related to the Guttenberg team

00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,490
but has been using it since like oh you

00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,430
need to do this and in which case

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:07,890
everyone's like oh and then they think

00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:10,860
about doing some changes so for example

00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:14,340
in my for if I go back to what actually

00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,350
is here so you have to declare a save

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,810
function even if you have no intention

00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,600
of ever actually saving anything at the

00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:23,640
moment but in five four if you don't

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,280
declare a save function it will just

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:30,390
assume you want to do the default thing

00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:32,220
and fall back to that saving you having

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:35,040
to type out an extra three lines in my

00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,870
case so there's lots of improvements to

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,940
the API and things which are coming

00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,800
along and they're really thinking hard

00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,870
about it and making sure that the

00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,180
experience for everyone whether they're

00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:48,270
developer or a user or just someone ting

00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,190
booking you is gonna be nice so just

00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,520
don't call it bad happens it's kind of

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,520
it just

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,850
there's a lot of projects out there that

00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:32,430
try and do the same thing is the WP CLI

00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:34,260
scaffold but in other ways my only my

00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:36,420
only comment final comment and that

00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,340
would be so there's other plugins like

00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,170
ACF and they try and provide their own

00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,810
way of sort of migrating things across

00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,850
the only issue is if you do that you're

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,060
kind of stuck in the ACF community

00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:50,070
looking for supports you can't go to the

00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,930
wider WordPress community and look at

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,880
wider WordPress knowledge because you

00:34:51,930 --> 00:35:05,550
kind of specifically need to know about

00:34:53,880 --> 00:35:07,530
that bit of ACF system on oh oh it's an

00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:11,090
evolving thing you might say about the

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,090
future but I'm liking it

00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:28,950
I'll be around in the day if you have

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,950
