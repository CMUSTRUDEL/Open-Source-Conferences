Publication date: 2020-04-27
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	Over time, products get tangled. There’s a race to add new features, fix the most bugs, enhance the user experience – until eventually, your product is a confusing and complicated mess, like a tangled ball of yarn. This complexity is a natural progression for any product, but it’s possible to improve the situation. Join Tammie to discuss methods to distil a product flow down to its most essential parts, using the WordPress user experience as an example.
Good for all experience levels, and for people who work with other people.
