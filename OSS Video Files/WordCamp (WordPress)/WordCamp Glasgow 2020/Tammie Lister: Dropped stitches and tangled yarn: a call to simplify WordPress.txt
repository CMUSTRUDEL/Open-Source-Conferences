Title: Tammie Lister: Dropped stitches and tangled yarn: a call to simplify WordPress
Publication date: 2020-04-27
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	Over time, products get tangled. There’s a race to add new features, fix the most bugs, enhance the user experience – until eventually, your product is a confusing and complicated mess, like a tangled ball of yarn. This complexity is a natural progression for any product, but it’s possible to improve the situation. Join Tammie to discuss methods to distil a product flow down to its most essential parts, using the WordPress user experience as an example.
Good for all experience levels, and for people who work with other people.

around tangling we have into those

00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,830
[Music]

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,319
[Music]

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,930
the first time you learn how to you tags

00:01:49,850 --> 00:02:57,480
you have to publish how you gonna know

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:59,430
where to go to that post product not

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,130
thinking about really how we can still

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,200
find get entangled there needs to be a

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:08,030
bit of consideration of what the daily

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:12,049
activities are going to be and really

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,049
humid it can then be improved

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,270
how complicated is experience of

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,670
wordpress give you we can all improve

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:34,050
things but we have to be realistic and

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:37,640
we have to angle down is and I know that

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,640
I've used it in the past

00:03:42,980 --> 00:04:23,820
okay knowledge knowledge we want to use

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,300
it but we might be judging what is in

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,360
simplest and easiest route a if we know

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,460
what is in we're going to be able to

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,690
find some tea strainer but if we

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,400
actually don't know where the door is

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,380
and we actually don't know where the

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,570
kitchen is we're probably not going to

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,570
have much success finding a tea strainer

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:25,610
we don't completely do any other

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:29,810
combinations or single-season simplest

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:32,270
things for the admin color way it really

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:38,930
is how this computer and in the world

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:44,030
where you can combine anything computing

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:52,670
often precarious a big problem of

00:05:44,030 --> 00:06:00,800
sensibility is opening its creates a

00:05:52,670 --> 00:06:03,260
patchwork and a confusing interface how

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,540
do you start when everything is changing

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,310
or different we can even maybe follow a

00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,310
tutorial because it doesn't look like

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,870
the thing that you have in front of you

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,930
it's like trying to you the product

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,420
who's there is constantly morphing and

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,300
nobody nobody likes unexpected

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,290
experiences you shouldn't need a map to

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,290
actually write a post

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,360
as I noted earlier a large issue it

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,940
simply the passage of time and how long

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,950
were accessing around it comes in many

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,560
forms from it being built for desktop

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:41,560
first so backwards compatibility trying

00:06:35,560 --> 00:07:04,000
to keep supporting what once was it's

00:06:41,560 --> 00:07:06,280
moving to be to do things so in all our

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,830
options we've created something paradox

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,300
of choice which is simply you just can't

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,300
choose because there's too many options

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,980
too many places are available to do the

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,430
same thing what might have been thought

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:34,390
of is helpful by just surfacing it often

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,250
confusing example how many different

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:40,510
ways there are to get to media and

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,400
there's quite a few I've been

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,470
foundational problems with the interface

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,690
itself that we really can ignore the

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:51,760
problem and one of the biggest disease

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:58,150
is there's no clear no obvious way we

00:07:51,760 --> 00:08:03,300
have a lot of repeating interfaces even

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,300
on the same page which components

00:08:37,500 --> 00:09:48,480
finding work we have to navigate

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:33,680
and we get to see the hierarchy and it's

00:10:33,769 --> 00:11:25,430
important by taking the color way we

00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:25,430
start to think about what we are doing

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,470
to see the clothes and how they connect

00:11:52,329 --> 00:13:11,610
you starting to think about the tension

00:13:16,499 --> 00:14:01,860
and then another point to consider

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,709
is what state has someone reached the

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,720
screen it's all of this important to

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:10,709
everyone at the same time of their

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,800
journey alone is looking at the ceiling

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:15,450
the navigation and he's dealing

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,940
dashboards and these kind of things that

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,540
we're considering we need to think about

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,730
our settings give you the amounts of

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,430
pages you have to move around

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,730
it's just interactive setting it's all

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:31,890
of this needed I'm thinking about what

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:35,490
is needed we can think about what we

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:37,860
really want to surface we just have one

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,980
seventh page and a lot of these things

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:44,640
that we've found sort of hiding things

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,279
in there all right I would argue we need

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,589
to look for this further what can we

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,810
truly remove and take the strain of

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:56,339
understanding from those that come into

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:59,010
this experience to truly be experiences

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:02,010
we need to be aware and think of mental

00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:07,950
models dimensional and mental model is

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:45,570
the way that we think and all the doors

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:49,620
open and it turns out there's too much

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:51,329
not only did the test go but anger Rises

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,770
because it's humans we've really don't

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,770
like being stupid

00:16:10,540 --> 00:17:40,309
how do we do that you have to think

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:56,720
about a morning but it really is

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:58,340
possible with the tools that we have to

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,909
be conscious about where things are

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,139
they're better than the truth right by

00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:05,139
them when they need them

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:31,760
I'm sure you get what you need when you

00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:35,860
need it excuse to confusion we design

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,860
everything all the same time

00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:47,250
these questions is that a better start

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,930
do you mean to have the amount of things

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,120
that we do in the sidebar

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,100
maybe it would start YouTube what you're

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,280
going to use it for and it adapts it

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,400
with a purpose maybe there's no power at

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,380
all these ideas we need to start

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,540
exploring beyond our other side flowers

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:08,520
and accordions and weapons as well as a

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,920
long-standing project part of our

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,160
practice really needs to be clear this

00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:18,540
is clear the channels and soon those

00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,210
flows the only 15 honestly critically we

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:24,330
have another Sinha a technology of what

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:27,690
we need do we really need everything

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:32,520
today so we have what is getting in the

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:35,370
way what truly is something that means

00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,890
iterations and part of this is being

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:44,670
okay with accessibility if the baseline

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:47,100
experiment is solid we beyond this let's

00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:53,190
take a look at what we can refine and we

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:55,520
still in its distance what can you do

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,900
today better and what can we iterate

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,050
these are all questions we should be

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,050
asking

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:06,570
we don't really have a welcome mat in

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,840
the WordPress experience to take a

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:14,340
journey and kind of focus in the work

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,080
that we do experience it's really

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:20,240
something that we can do we can have

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,240
that welcome mat that includes everyone

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,610
a wizard is a welcome alone Hannah much

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,100
Tyler uses gesture it is not backed up

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:49,390
with real magic words that don't do

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:52,240
magic just not great wizards of it we

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:55,480
need to be able to see and try the full

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,760
community and really explore the

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,700
interface to know what we're doing to be

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,710
doing this and for a tiny little way of

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,539
doing this is you can preview a block in

00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,840
the editor so you can see what you might

00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:11,080
be able to use system is what we will be

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:15,760
able to take it with new fog of surprise

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:24,899
in the interface when it comes to nobody

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:24,899
likes and they like them

00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:56,659
start embracing holiday this is the

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,230
thing you need right where you need it

00:24:56,659 --> 00:25:05,119
and bring the experience simpler and to

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:06,889
those leaders including terms you need

00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,499
to remember that first time we need our

00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:13,519
first row all the time we made our first

00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:16,629
piece and that excitement what is true

00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,519
that over time pilots get tangled

00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:26,989
doesn't mean that we should accept and

00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:30,049
wait add new features there's an honesty

00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:34,269
a point of affection it's needed to

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:34,269
recognize that handled walls experienced

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,919
are continuing to do that to create

00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,919
truly a product for the years ahead

00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:06,720
okay so now's your chance to ask the

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,720
little fishes

00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,720
the foundation is we can't create for

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,320
the fact that we don't know it doesn't

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,660
matter what company I work for

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,270
right about all of that I think it's

00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,730
very easy term headspace which is base

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,740
with you it's very hard to design

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:12,260
outside of the space that we're in win

00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:16,850
the body in this head we need to work

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:19,490
Europe says being testing tables we need

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:22,430
to listen look at the Support Forums

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:25,400
little gold mine of information every

00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:28,670
single contributor team is a goldmine of

00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,220
information it's about that go beyond

00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:34,700
just even the pantries in a language

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:50,030
it's incredibly important we are

00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:56,750
building a rambling I'm giving you but I

00:27:50,030 --> 00:28:12,050
am so agree we needs to look at any

00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:14,600
story to do so we have this amazing

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:16,300
featuring for future plugins so doing

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,150
things like

00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:22,320
the design team I can see so back to you

00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:25,210
we have a horseman experiment plugging

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,340
things like that oh great because

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,010
they're just the way is like doing this

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:34,380
idea I think it's kinda based on three

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,380
things but what happened there so I

00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:41,920
think the community and that's something

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:48,720
that different companies can get hosting

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,720
companies collectively the project

00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,610
ready interesting and ready

00:29:08,910 --> 00:30:15,000
because you can do this world or

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,000
Wikipedia because that was

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:28,010
there are so many people here gonna be

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,600
talking to you I'll come talk to you and

00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,600
we can hopefully help you

00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,630
[Music]

00:31:45,679 --> 00:32:00,539
I think why the reaction to that is

00:31:50,220 --> 00:32:02,369
because if you have an art box you have

00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:07,490
everything in it to create everything

00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:07,490
you don't need to go to an art store

00:32:48,860 --> 00:33:01,710
by the nature improves there's like a

00:32:52,530 --> 00:33:03,420
cascade effect it's about collectively

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,750
looking at that I don't think we should

00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,220
necessarily cause everything spend four

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,630
years on the design system and then

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:20,040
we're good to go because the design

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:22,950
system isn't on the path to doing that

00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,200
but we can't expect someone do a new

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,510
plugin develop or a theme developer you

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,550
have to learn the way that we do things

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:32,880
on plug-in so there's all this kind of

00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:36,179
we need to sort out a house and the core

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:44,700
before we can do that I think it's

00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:47,030
happening I think we will by the nature

00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,030
of having

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,090
okay thank you everybody and thank you

00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:03,850
Tammy very much so maybe it went

00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:05,590
rambling on too long at the start all

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,539
day I love talking to people

00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,309
thanks to that's why we're here and

00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:11,819
that's why it's such a great event our

00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:11,819
