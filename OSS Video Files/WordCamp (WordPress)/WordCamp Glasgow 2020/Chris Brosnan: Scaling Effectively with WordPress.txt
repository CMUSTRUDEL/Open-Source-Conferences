Description: 
	One of the most common misconceptions about WordPress is that it does not scale well and is only for small sites. This assumption is untrue, but it exists because of wider misconceptions about the use of WordPress and its purpose. With good planning and consideration before and during a WordPress projectâ€™s lifecycle, we can ensure that the project scales well and has the flexibility to add new features without too much scope creep or performance impact. By avoiding waste, using coding standards, and adopting a serious software development mindset to WordPress projects it is easy to build WordPress sites that will scale effectively. This talk will introduce these concepts.
