Title: Claire Brotherton: Examining the Accessibility of Popular WordPress Page Builders
Publication date: 2020-04-29
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	Page builders like Beaver Builder and Elementor are immensely popular because they let you create sophisticated layouts quickly and with minimal code knowledge. But are the web pages they produce accessible? I take both builders for a spin to see whether their templated content meets accessibility standards and what room there is for improvement.

[Music]

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
here

00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,809
[Music]

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,770
[Music]

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,360
to move

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,050
[Music]

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:30,259
this is elementor's fashion or icons

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,860
this is follow on to translate languages

00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,860
spyler

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,340
[Music]

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,719
[Music]

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,289
[Music]

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,759
[Music]

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,259
[Music]

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,169
[Music]

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,490
[Music]

00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,840
moving on

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:56,840
so these elementor's compact forms in

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,740
one of their time telling us the

00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,740
generations to come

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,690
this one

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,260
[Music]

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,500
[Music]

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,380
[Music]

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,940
[Music]

00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,160
elementor's version of an image parcel

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,160
but this one

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,719
again

00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,719
[Music]

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,149
[Music]

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,140
again

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,690
[Music]

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:10,290
so again you can see that's just

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,290
automatically sweeping across

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,210
so

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,429
[Music]

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,650
[Music]

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,669
[Music]

00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,899
well

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,680
[Music]

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,000
so Elementary's woman is this any better

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,150
so

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:26,019
[Music]

00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,220
[Music]

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:25,650
any other form for the generally

00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,650
accessible lately bollocks gravity forms

00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,630
I'm not

00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:20,059
[Music]

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,609
[Music]

00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,460
[Music]

00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,950
[Music]

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,720
really

00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,530
I don't have much things of faith

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,530
visitor

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,450
more mature

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,640
[Music]

00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,680
well

00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,150
[Music]

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,460
good time for one more

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:14,590
I'm just looking for here like a few

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,590
months baby

00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,580
it always gave up

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,609
[Music]

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,549
