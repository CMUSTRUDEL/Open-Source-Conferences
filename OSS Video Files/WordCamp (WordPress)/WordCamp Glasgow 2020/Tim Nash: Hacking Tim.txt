Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	Itâ€™s a new decade and for many of us, new starts. For me this year is all about productivity and workflows. In this talk, I walk through my workflows and processes I have been optimising to keep me going as a developer, a sysadmin, and a tinkerer. From terminals, to running shoes, everything is hackable.
