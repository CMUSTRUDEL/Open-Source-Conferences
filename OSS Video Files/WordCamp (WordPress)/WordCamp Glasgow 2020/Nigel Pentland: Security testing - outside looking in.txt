Title: Nigel Pentland: Security testing - outside looking in
Publication date: 2020-04-28
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	I’ll start by trying to convince folks why they should be considering  the subject of security testing in relation to their WordPress sites.  Assuming I’ve managed to convince you why, then I’ll move onto showing  you just how anyone can use Kali (don’t worry, I’ll explain what Kali  is!) as a tool for doing some basic security testing with a minimal  learning curve to get started. This is being aimed at the novice level  in terms of ‘security people’ but very inclusive in terms of anyone who  is part of the WordPress community.

organizers security thank you yeah I do

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,150
feel as a sleep folks either in as much

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,580
as probably been more active from what

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,400
part of the security community as

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,349
opposed to the workplace community I've

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,489
really only gotten involved in what

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:40,350
place since I retired so let's just see

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,480
Security's a bit of a passion whereas

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,059
workplace does it has a bit of an

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,940
interest I wouldn't describe myself as a

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,160
what place a expert but I would like to

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,079
think I've got some significant

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,800
experience and security the perspective

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,530
of outside looking in that's one of my

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:07,380
favorite pictures to do the security for

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:10,380
kind of obvious reasons it sort of does

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,610
have a serious point we are depending

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,159
whether you and the other side of that

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,759
thing is looking this way or on the

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,150
outside looking in you get a different

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,869
impression of what's going on and what

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,850
I'm trying to get across in this talk is

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:29,780
the usefulness and the importance of

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:35,909
trying to find a different perspective

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:38,759
on looking at the examining your your

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,290
website because you tend to spend most

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,360
of your time logging in to what place

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,490
and looking at the dashboard and doing

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,689
our stuff from the NSA may be quite as

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,710
putting the same effort into looking at

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:56,909
it from the outside so again today

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:59,729
testing or buying this thing needs to be

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,500
part of the management process it's not

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,020
a case of you design a website and then

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,409
you find

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:09,459
- cuter it has to be part of the process

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,400
and you really want to be trying to

00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:14,769
adopt a bit of a security mindset which

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,709
for the most part is being inquisitive

00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:24,580
and questioning and going why is that

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:34,480
like that is that right there are all

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:38,640
different sort of frameworks and Weez of

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,280
different methodologies for looking at

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,480
your life cycle model what's your life

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,540
cycle your website

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,720
picks a true theater accurately the next

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,630
one which one of the advantages of it

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,459
being nests which is to do with the

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,959
American government is anything that's

00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,500
produced for the American government is

00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,140
copyright free so feel free to make use

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,079
of it and they are that particular image

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,660
is showing that in effect that are kind

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:09,970
of five general ideas to that where

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:14,079
you've got identified potato detect

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,060
respond recover but without dwelling in

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,389
that too much the point is a bit part of

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,450
an overall a staple

00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:26,680
that's just seeing what nest entre

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,840
that's another way of kind of picturing

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,670
the same framework but again the issuing

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,389
it has being circular so it's an ongoing

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:41,109
process you never finished doing it you

00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:43,569
should be always trying to stay on top

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:46,180
of it and considering security as part

00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:48,940
of it now this is what kind of like that

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,579
I think of as the malting analogy of a

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,310
more tea taste you have lots of drivers

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:57,609
who drive a car they don't necessarily

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,139
know how to service the car you may not

00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:02,260
be experts in what goes on under the

00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:07,150
boiler but if you've ever feel Daniel T

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,650
taste because of a light bulb was a next

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,660
time you go to your car for any more

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,400
details you at least check the Y eats

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,560
maybe change the tires to take a few

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,950
things it doesn't have to be

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,620
it doesn't have to be that difficult an

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,290
icy security in the same way people

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:27,160
should take an active interest in

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,110
looking at how the website is secure but

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,720
there are still times where you would

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:36,870
want to go an employee a spatial as the

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:39,580
pain taster to then do that properly but

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,260
just as you would take your card before

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,180
you take it for a name with T you should

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,220
check your website before you get paint

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,010
a student because otherwise you're

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,990
paying then to do something which half

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,620
of what they will do or B stuff you

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,580
could have done anyway another one which

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,830
I would just mention briefly is PCI DSS

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:03,460
which if anybody's ever come across that

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,360
these payment card payment card industry

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,370
data security standard I spent most of

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,669
my life in financial services so that

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,240
one is kind of when I got to know rather

00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:19,060
real which comes from you keycaps

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,140
association where they bring into all

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:30,250
their 12 high level requirements which

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:32,650
fall into six categories and simply

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,400
looking down the bottom regular month

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,380
regular monitor and taste networks and

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,860
regularly taste security systems and

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,430
processes so essentially if you've got

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:50,919
website that's taking tap payments

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:52,780
you should be abiding by you key card

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,930
Association and if you were a big

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:59,200
merchant or a bank you would be required

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,150
to get professional paint testers in to

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,200
test you say if you're small mention

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:07,360
well that's obviously because you get

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,539
integrated ears but it's just it's

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:15,370
another reason why you you want to take

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:18,639
security kind of seriously know in order

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:21,150
to do security chasing from the outside

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,150
looking in

00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:29,729
the way I would suggest doing it is to

00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:32,609
use Linux distribution that's called

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:36,689
Kali now some people may know of Carrie

00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:41,329
and some people may not but Kali is

00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:45,419
essentially UNIX but on top of that UNIX

00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:48,449
the people that maintain and put this

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:52,439
together have installed noodles and

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:54,779
oodles of security utilities there I'm

00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,819
going to concentrate mainly on one and

00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,129
then at the end I'll mention some others

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:02,099
that are on the other error what's

00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:05,219
having a look at possibly spending a bit

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:08,999
of time on but in order to get that

00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:11,339
running I've got a Windows PC here so

00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:14,669
how am I going to run Linux on that and

00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:18,689
the answer is for me VirtualBox there

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:22,379
are other and virtual machine emulators

00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:24,689
over there VMware and others etc I

00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:28,019
haven't really got to abort our phones

00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:33,209
I used to use VMware but then I found

00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:37,729
dr. boxes I found slightly easier so in

00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:41,279
order to get started go to that URL

00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:43,589
install it and we eagle you think or

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,409
VirtualBox would it doesn't ask you

00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:48,839
anything other than do you want to solve

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,519
this yes sits there for several minutes

00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,709
and then at the end of it says yep

00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,519
that's you installed and you've gotten

00:07:52,709 --> 00:08:01,349
in your desktop so the next step is to

00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:03,539
then go to a site where you can get

00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:06,569
karey obviously you want to get it from

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:09,899
a trusted source and the police I would

00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,809
suggest is the distribution produced by

00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:16,919
offensive security which is a

00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:19,229
well-regarded security file now on that

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:23,699
link that I've given there you will see

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:26,099
that it says p.m. we are VirtualBox I

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,779
think there was another colleague Linux

00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,779
image so there's a bit three different

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,950
images there was actually six because

00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:37,779
there's a 32 bit 64

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,399
for each so for me I go to the virtual

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,909
box I'm a Japan tailor sex the four

00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:45,370
black one that's the only thing to be

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,579
really over there and what you should be

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,949
downloading is a single OVA file now

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:55,930
that's a big file that's the gigabit so

00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm not gonna take it just a name but if

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,480
you've got decent Wi-Fi at home

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,470
shouldn't take too long

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:14,519
at home for me it's a bit 10 minutes so

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:14,519
not too bad and now this point I shall

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:22,380
flip over to this is not doing what I

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,380
want it to do

00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:47,290
yes Joe that's me

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:51,199
chewing the protocol VirtualBox manager

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:55,550
so normally you would come along even

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:57,500
that screen there go to import you do

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,589
import and you give it the name of the

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,810
OVA file and you import it and it's it's

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:06,170
the young hunters away again that takes

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,879
several minutes for that to be ingested

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:19,129
as it bear but there's nothing difficult

00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:24,980
to be doing that was what I would see is

00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:28,790
when I download the system I always get

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,829
an error when I try and run it and if

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:35,930
you're going to say things you will see

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:39,500
there I have got that say - you can see

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:43,220
that just a bit USB one it defaults to a

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:46,040
USB 2 controller and always fails on any

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:50,480
machine I've ever tried which is this

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,189
one on my desktop performance so don't

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,350
be surprised if that happens and you see

00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:56,480
an error saying it doesn't like USB to

00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:00,500
look whatever it just going to settings

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,439
change USB 2 to USB 1 and you'll be ok

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:08,180
you can then start that and we go I will

00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:10,670
just start it it also mentioned down the

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,839
earth which is just flashed by it will

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,980
tell you in the notes Thea what the user

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:22,279
ID and password does for this system

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:24,670
which used to be route and tour until

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,940
this release

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:30,950
yeah before my team root and Taurus when

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,470
I was doing it with told as route

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:42,440
backwards and but this one they've

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:46,360
changed it to Kelly and Kelly we're

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:51,230
running with full Kali Linux

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:53,420
distribution which is essentially comes

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,340
pre-installed with lots and lots of

00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:00,260
goodies you can spend hours and hours

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,950
investigating those for doing all sorts

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:10,820
of security testing to use the

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:15,920
terminology there as far as this is

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:31,460
concerned I have got one here on my

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:33,320
windows box he what kind of dummy that

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:39,540
will tell me what place website which is

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:42,590
being hosted in Vietnam at which OH

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,590
[Music]

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,970
all right good

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,649
just remember there that those quite an

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:08,310
interesting little command which they

00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:10,260
added in this version of Carly in fact I

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,800
think it was the last one and this is

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,740
just proving to be what to switch

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,399
between them that is quite obviously a

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:24,060
UNIX tape environment they have already

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,949
boosted the size of the front on that so

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,180
that it should be greatly double and

00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:32,370
they came up with this nice little

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:35,760
command called Kali undercover which is

00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:41,750
just a pure indulgence for a techie who

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,750
happens to be genuine taste it

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,500
and it kinda looks like windows so for

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,850
some reason you're open about and you

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,430
don't want people to think that you're

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,580
having with not I mean security testing

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,320
with and Kali Linux you can make it look

00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,610
very much like Windows if you were so

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,610
long to and if I simply run that again

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:07,910
Kali undercover it just toggles all back

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:12,900
and we're back to looking like Moodle

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:14,610
properly as I see a meaner indulgence

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,620
but which one of those features that was

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:31,860
being much talked about in the latest

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:34,680
version and this was just purely a

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:40,080
little bit of an all as to see what it

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:43,410
is I think we've got running you I

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,200
simply had to sit up some couple of

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:49,710
horse savings so that what I've set up

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,780
as a UI they all called local party and

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,680
I can then start using that as a URL

00:14:51,780 --> 00:15:03,480
rather than taping IP addresses all the

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:06,900
time which is never ready CP and then

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,690
essentially the main tool want to use is

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,670
a thing called wpspan

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:16,370
which as the name suggests is for

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:20,700
scanning what place WP and it's

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:25,680
community tape small community that

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:27,960
produced this as configure and you're

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,300
quick at liberty to go in and get it and

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,670
use it but rather than installing it it

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,320
can be quite tricky to install so the

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,470
easiest way of getting this up and

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,350
running because by getting Kali with it

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:44,160
pre-installed get going with Callie and

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:46,650
it should just run and there's a number

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,150
of commands via which are in there they

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:54,370
can sleep but only attempt to switch

00:15:50,150 --> 00:16:01,010
back to those and actually show you some

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:12,770
yeah let's just check that we watch meet

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:15,070
me FY is that doing that says it's up

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,070
and running

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:13,089
essentially the the horse should be have

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,970
that local door Apache and that is

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:18,579
feeling because this is going to try to

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:21,010
attach to the networking here which

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:45,970
other sort of non-existent it's going to

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:48,630
try to attach to and it's okay what I

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,630
need to do

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:09,770
right this needs to be one six eight 56

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:40,559
don't wonder let's go to complain say

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:40,559
yes I do

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,769
[Music]

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,150
[Music]

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:30,730
so simple website running in Maui

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:36,030
I mean if I do it to you

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:42,390
Callie and I go to the Cali browser I

00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:42,390
should be able to do famous last words

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:55,420
so what the trees and there we go so

00:19:52,650 --> 00:20:00,400
easily

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:05,350
sure I've got next little taste say sir

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:08,430
what clink no with in my local machine

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:17,350
so it's all go for I'm not doing I'm not

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:25,350
connected to network so I go to here and

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:26,530
do AWP scan URL will call thought Apache

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,220
slash

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:34,060
what place that's basically because

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:37,780
sound all some songs it enters software

00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:41,230
extra called what place rated hit return

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:47,800
that this will worry it may ask me if it

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:49,480
wants to update in which case and it was

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:55,150
insane to have lots of information but

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:57,490
your website no you can see there I've

00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:01,000
left one nice little nugget for it to

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:05,170
find a Raider layout as in I've

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,870
deliberately left config the old file

00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:10,450
sitting there which is an absolute noon

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,870
or for anyone who doesn't realize that

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,600
do that again if you're using this as a

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,730
tool to help you you don't need to be an

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,850
expert in it you just run the tool and

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,530
see what it tells you and it's he's not

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,200
bad that kind of highlighting the things

00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,500
that for that are raid that's something

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,660
you

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,910
they do need to be concerned about if

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,400
you don't understand that won't find

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,140
somebody who does

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,010
because it needs to be sorted it's

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:43,030
important now most of the security

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:44,890
testing you look at WP sky tends to

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:49,510
behind the plugin releases or user

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:53,590
related most of the plugins it's really

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:55,930
a case of Aria plugins up to thee and

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:59,830
the other thing about plugins can is it

00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:01,990
takes time so I'm kind of gonna try to

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,110
say that because it doesn't make for a

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:09,460
good presentation useless on the other

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:13,180
hand is much more interesting there's

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:15,910
some ways more important and the other

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,490
thing about the user setup is in terms

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:23,290
of if somebody tries to hack into your

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:26,350
website using user credentials how do

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:29,020
you know if there's anything there to

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,090
try and stop them because you might have

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,150
stuff configured within what place as a

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:37,210
some form of security plug-in which may

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,610
mean or what I have tasted quite a few

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:43,330
that didn't work there is not in the way

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:48,670
that they were claiming to so hence the

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:51,550
value of testing but also your provider

00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:55,690
whoever's hosting it we have all sorts

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:57,840
of intrusion detection systems or web

00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:01,980
access firewalls or various different

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,510
Penta measures - time to take your site

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,940
you will only really find it with that

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,280
if you go and do some rudimentary

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:16,150
testing and see whether or not you can

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:18,360
get through know the links that will in

00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,360
fact

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:31,980
I just need to change the vector here

00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:36,330
cause one Cali there in amongst all the

00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:41,330
utilities they provide what lists well

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:43,919
for anybody who's ever tried a look at

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,350
hacking with the gas to trying to guess

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,529
passwords one of the ways you do it is

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:53,210
you get a tool or some description of

00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:56,730
which WP scan and walk for us and you

00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:59,369
feed that to a dictionary of passwords

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,019
and see here's a whole lot of password

00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:15,509
it's gonna go and try them on he's

00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:19,769
account and tell me if you find any in

00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:25,110
there and it's in the the food plan for

00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:28,740
it's in the suite there's quite a famous

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:31,080
one called rock Q which comes from a

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,350
website the rocky website which was

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,779
hacked many years ago and they had very

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,990
cool encryption and they basically got

00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:42,480
all the passwords on the same and that

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,639
became a bit of a de-facto dictionary

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,429
there's an awful last words in there

00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:49,740
won't be one of ones once it people use

00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:54,690
when it comes to passwords if you try

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:57,179
and think up a password don't be misled

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,029
into believing you're the only person to

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:02,279
have ever thought that that's what

00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:04,499
humans are predictable in also many ways

00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,990
and I guarantee somebody else will have

00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:09,690
already used that password so for that

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:13,049
reason I use randomly generated

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:16,619
passwords we're at all possible don't

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:18,629
think you can find beat them up such

00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:22,440
that you can remember them and it'll be

00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:25,549
a good password so if you do

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,549
WP scan

00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:34,340
if I walk back to the Uriel so I'm now

00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:40,260
in the right place to be able to do

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:43,050
passwords and I'm going to use for Q

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,570
which I have to say it is the big

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,600
dictionary in most cases you wouldn't

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,820
start with using such a big dictionary

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,340
there's there thousands of thousands of

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,820
passwords on there if I just run that

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,730
and see what happens

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:03,440
the default for this is from what place

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:07,230
tries to buy what sky wpspan

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,190
tries to assess the website it will

00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:13,170
train in human e the first paying users

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:17,040
so for that reason I say obtain users on

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:20,610
here you can tell it to do all users

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,940
which is a big website no I would have

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:28,220
tried it on any you can get thousands of

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:31,140
users that can be very interesting and

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,630
but there you go it's no throwing that

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,100
dictionary at that website now this is

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,440
walk walk so it's being it's lightly

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,400
quicker than a grid across a network but

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,470
the point is we've just thrown several

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:50,520
hundred class words at that and it's

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:57,170
gone and got every single one and there

00:26:50,520 --> 00:27:00,060
we go from once you see up to Bobo's now

00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:02,310
if you've used a password that's based

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:05,100
on somebody's name or somebody's paid or

00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:07,080
whatever else I was that high likelihood

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,960
that somebody really wanted to get to

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:13,380
your website they could leave a PC

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,530
running either a call or somewhere else

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:19,890
and just leave it in the corner until it

00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:22,540
eventually gets one it will simply undo

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,510
that old four DS you

00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:28,360
you can easily throw hundreds of the

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:31,600
confusion to Pascal Titanium's website

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:36,160
so you need to have some other form of

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,910
mitigation or some other security on

00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:49,720
that so let's just go back to the

00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:59,350
website I'm gonna fire up the two tabs

00:27:49,720 --> 00:28:01,090
here just good log on and user I think

00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:11,350
one two three four five six she goes in

00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:15,280
a little behold we have 10 users only

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:18,070
one of those is an administrator so in

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,930
to hacking tradition not we need to

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:25,740
interested in the race I'll just

00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:25,740
concentrate in the one called user know

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:33,810
the other thing one here is a good

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:37,020
plugins don't have very many plugins

00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:40,900
I've got one called limit login attempts

00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:47,140
now I've activated that I have changed

00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:49,780
the settings on this so that it will

00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,660
only the default is a lot yet for 20

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:58,180
minutes I've changed that to one minute

00:28:52,660 --> 00:29:03,030
that's the least I could do so I come

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,030
back here and try that again

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:20,030
don't worry it rains that nice that when

00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:23,750
I get the does the 10 users ever and

00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:30,460
know is just going to sit there and it

00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:33,320
should come back with videus it's just

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,600
contemplating there we go and you can

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,580
see that it's kind of hacking away and

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,610
the attempts just keep going up but it's

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:46,010
not finding anything because the website

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:53,240
itself is going so it's that easy to try

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:56,630
and mitigate somebody hacking in no the

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,400
thing that makes us particularly an

00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:02,650
important thing to be in the main is

00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:07,730
some of the security walking attempt

00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:11,390
limiting plugins that I've seen will

00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:13,850
prevent logins where somebody is

00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,700
attempting a login screen to interact

00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:21,309
for the login but this software uses

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,309
various techniques you can use the XML

00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:31,309
RPC that's one thank you I mean it can

00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,070
also use cookies but it essentially

00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:36,380
rates the password to a cookie then say

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,380
it's kind of it and no change the cookie

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:45,020
and I get in or change the cookie and

00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:47,390
again it's very quick you it can do at

00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,520
least one sake and very often a lot

00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:52,160
faster than that so you can have

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,720
something sadlier checking the obvious

00:30:52,160 --> 00:31:01,550
passwords so it really you kind of think

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,100
well that's quite important know being

00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:07,190
from a security background one of the

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,929
things which gets found at home is what

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:13,130
often get referred to as the onion

00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:14,400
principle you want to have security in

00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,860
layers you don't want

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,980
to have also get to theater as a sport

00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,970
for a single point failure so okay we

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:31,470
can have a plug in there and we can have

00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:35,100
it so that it stops an attack like that

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,870
so that it limits it and incidentally if

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:42,600
you don't think people are trying to

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:45,240
attack your website you're wrong I get

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,080
on out well last year looked up the

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:53,060
stats and I got 150 emails where those

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,060
emails said that are detected for

00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:58,580
invalid attempts and had subsequently

00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:03,990
locked oh that IP address for 20 minutes

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:10,260
no that's what you know today is that

00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:12,360
600 actual invalid attends so if you're

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,640
not if you've got software on there and

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,480
it's not telling you that somebody's

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,250
trying to hack in you're wrong now my

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,350
website is just a little personal

00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:27,510
homepage but maybe I just paranoid as I

00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:33,960
display that I'm a professional was a

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:35,850
professional paranoid even leading up to

00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,280
this tour in the last couple of weeks

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:40,650
the number of people trying to hack it

00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,200
my website has gone up I don't know how

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,470
many of you let some of these be having

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,470
a go

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:57,760
technically I'm not paying taster that

00:32:53,500 --> 00:33:00,340
yes and I really do you have to be that

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,490
one because what I also want to do is

00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:05,620
see well okay in this onion principle is

00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,500
that anything else we can do to protect

00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:12,270
ourselves from somebody trying to hack

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:14,649
in because we are not one of the most

00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:17,500
prevalent ways of trying to attack the

00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:23,010
website is people just playing see if

00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,010
they can login using stolen credentials

00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:47,220
I still do have a LinkedIn okay

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:51,700
LinkedIn good hacked many years ago and

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:54,299
my password got discovered it was a

00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,029
randomly generated eight characters I

00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,250
still get emails to this day of

00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:02,950
so-called hackers saying they've hacked

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,289
my home PC here's my password if I don't

00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,589
do something about it and if I don't pay

00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:11,109
them so many Bitcoin they will make said

00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:13,530
to xhr you know you may have had these

00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:13,530
yourself

00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:19,270
again that's another reason for having

00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,780
different passwords for every okay when

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:25,599
I've had various things where you've

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,179
been Poland has contacted me and say

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,550
Europe your credentials have been found

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,560
in the wild this email address this

00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,179
password so I go and look out on the

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,139
password safe or that passport which

00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,109
accounts that for

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:40,119
oh that okay if you use a common

00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,770
password that's the biggest new law if

00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,020
there's one thing you learn today from

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:48,899
you go out of here do you not use the

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:55,800
same password for to obtain anyway great

00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:57,650
so that's the users we saw those users

00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:04,359
in

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:14,119
what place and there are the users in my

00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:19,339
the PHP okay so what I want to do very

00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:27,640
quickly I will prove that I can do WP

00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:35,150
scan URL go gachi

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:43,220
what place I'm going to tell it you only

00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:46,210
do user names user and I'm going to tell

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,650
it to use password

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,720
taste and now I've already created a

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,460
little taste file there and the only

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,339
thing that this file is the password one

00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:57,339
two three four five six so if I run that

00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:07,720
and hopefully spill user names directly

00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:20,000
the Joyce opinion dislikes it arranged

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:26,450
hey this should very quickly get that

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,060
password very quickly and they've got it

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:32,030
there we go

00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:33,920
so what can I do to stop that apart from

00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,690
having a plugin because we don't want a

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,840
single point of failure so if we want

00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:41,330
multiple levels of protection what can

00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,360
we do to protect ourselves well the

00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:48,620
answer is actually surprisingly simple

00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:52,280
if I go in here and edit that user now

00:36:48,620 --> 00:37:00,710
let's just change the organ name to boom

00:36:52,280 --> 00:37:10,640
laughter I'll save that now if I go back

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:12,470
to here user and facts almost being

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,160
caught oh yeah I'll have to put in on

00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,710
neptr

00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,410
one two three four five six is that way

00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:20,270
through me you will see that within what

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,440
place it still says its user but I only

00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:26,600
were Dutchman I know it's called the

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,340
Miata now interestingly most people

00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,820
obtain hacked my website try for the

00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:34,400
account admin you will find I don't have

00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,050
an account called admin what place

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:42,110
thinks I have an account called admin

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:52,030
but I don't if I go to here and try that

00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:52,030
again you'll see field but

00:37:53,790 --> 00:38:00,720
your valid password spooned that if I

00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:06,410
come back to here and simply change user

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,410
to whom editor this same offender

00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,880
so I think that's what while doing I

00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:16,150
wouldn't do it for every password on the

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,330
website on what place website but I

00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,010
would do it for the administrators you

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,480
don't really want to advertise it

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,280
administrators and you probably don't

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:43,950
want to have an account called admin

00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:47,020
change it to something humans just

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,020
[Music]

00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,890
because I have to get back to them

00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,740
because to me that is the ultimate

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,270
Poteet looking in that's actually taken

00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,150
from the moon looking back towards the

00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:01,150
Earth and I just thought that was an

00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:03,130
absolutely cracking picture which has an

00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:07,750
awful awful interesting internet history

00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:09,910
too but yes same is a questions very

00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,640
quickly we just mentioned that on the

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:15,340
end of this presentation I've stuck some

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:20,010
additional commands and utilities that

00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:22,630
you might want to try if you do get

00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,880
install Kali who and try those other

00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:41,320
ones as well you will see some

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:43,690
interesting food no understanding the

00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:47,010
defaults you just do sudo it isn't

00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,010
anybody for visit yes

00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:10,940
I know this is your answer

00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:13,250
it might find some open doors that might

00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,920
give you some clues to help me I've been

00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,990
hacked but no it's not an auditing thing

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,029
and it wouldn't actually tell me what's

00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:22,700
there you might see something that you

00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:25,250
go all she got I've left up for example

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:29,900
config file that's probably how they got

00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:33,430
in but no it's it's only going to give

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,430
you some limited information

00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,799
you can do up until now when I had been

00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,420
looking at two factored it typically was

00:40:49,799 --> 00:41:21,630
something you were having to pay for and

00:40:51,420 --> 00:41:23,099
I was kind of avoiding it because of the

00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,880
main thing I would say whatever you go

00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:29,460
for if you go to factor three the
