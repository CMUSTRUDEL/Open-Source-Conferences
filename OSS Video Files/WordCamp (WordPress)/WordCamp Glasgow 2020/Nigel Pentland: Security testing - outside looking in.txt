Title: Nigel Pentland: Security testing - outside looking in
Publication date: 2020-04-28
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	I’ll start by trying to convince folks why they should be considering  the subject of security testing in relation to their WordPress sites.  Assuming I’ve managed to convince you why, then I’ll move onto showing  you just how anyone can use Kali (don’t worry, I’ll explain what Kali  is!) as a tool for doing some basic security testing with a minimal  learning curve to get started. This is being aimed at the novice level  in terms of ‘security people’ but very inclusive in terms of anyone who  is part of the WordPress community.
