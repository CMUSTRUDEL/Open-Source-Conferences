Title: Ahmed Khalifa: Let’s Make Captions Beautiful to Get More People Engaging With Your Videos
Publication date: 2020-04-29
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	Lighting, audio and storytelling are all essential when creating video-based content. However, captions are often forgotten, even though it can benefit more people than you think. You might assume that it’s just for the d/Deaf and hard of hearing people. But there are other benefits: learn a new language, access to different culture, improve SEO, watch in quiet environments, increase social media engagements. But even more people can benefit, like those who are autistic, have learning disability or have attention deficits.
From sharing my own personal experience as a deaf person, combined with my experience in digital marketing and content marketing, I combine the two to share stories on how you, as a content creator, can maximise the impact of your videos by making use of captions.
But it’s not just about writing “whatever is said”. It is an art. So let’s make captions, not just a necessity, but also beautiful…for everyone!
