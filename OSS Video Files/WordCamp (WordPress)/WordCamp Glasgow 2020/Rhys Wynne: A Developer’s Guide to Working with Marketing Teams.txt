Publication date: 2020-04-27
Playlist: WordCamp Glasgow 2020
Description: 
	As somebody who has been both a developer and marketing team leader in my career, I’ve been able to see when projects go wrong between developers and outside or internal marketing team. In this talk, I’ll share a few areas on where relationships break down, how to avoid problems before they arise, and also tips to get marketing teams on your side so you can both serve a happy client.

you can come in like that well maybe a

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:11,500
lot in fashion for it so Google is

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:25,210
associated with the homepage maybe you

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:28,110
can build a monster I get a couple of

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,220
clicks through that dominant position

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,700
but I can build like a page this

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,700
dedicated

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:56,509
right skills I'd originally Thomas talk

00:11:51,240 --> 00:12:00,000
before I do the talk we would comprise

00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:02,370
so he came up to me after you talk

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,660
however I had a problem with this one

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:08,939
and I was like okay and they explained

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,329
it and I was like yeah may complete my

00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:11,329
percent

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,650

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,340
[Music]

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,810
they may also realize it's not a good

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,030
idea is when they start releasing it and

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,690
kind of like saying thank you think

00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:44,940
about it then they go actually yeah

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,990
all you end up in exactly the place you

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:52,400
were before it started at this point

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,400

coming working with like external so

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:14,580
what maybe seem to be a 10 minute job is

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:17,360
actually quite substantial recently

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,580
where we were used in the workplace ID

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:30,440
number and they were just like well the

00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:32,730
invoice numbers it's gonna be a lot of

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,290
explaining why they got an understanding

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,290
of the situation

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,219
[Music]

00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,180
[Music]

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,150
so without the project

00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,250
but it was almost solely motivators for

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,250
wanting switch it over

00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,850
to stay alive amid kamikaze coldest I've

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,720
ever seen

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,720
for two

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,430
we were just like

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,499
[Music]

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,800
we have

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,640
yeah I mean generally speaking I mean

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,490

[Music]

00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,529
[Music]

00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,860
you know

00:29:06,940 --> 00:30:13,769
I learned

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:16,950
a lot of people unlicensed argue and

00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:18,840
fight you know showing them my Google

00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:21,480
Analytics in time there why what would

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,700
you recommend things like campaign going

00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:29,570
is kind of a few seconds you know in

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,570
JavaScript it's a job

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,990
typical question

00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,880
yeah

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,910
[Music]

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,020
I'm not enough it depends on what you

00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:40,220
think so if you talk kind of like a

00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:42,230
small area you probably don't mean there

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:47,390
won't be kind of optimize for that local

00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:49,730
area would just be enough for something

00:31:47,390 --> 00:32:04,190
like

00:31:49,730 --> 00:32:05,180
all season pump is all you know and then

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:08,630
you think the things we're trying to go

00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:14,270
right back and open here so it may be

00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:16,600
like a bit longer professed don't quote

00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,600
me on this

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,960
it's like a technical SEO

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,299
for one more question if anyone

00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,170
