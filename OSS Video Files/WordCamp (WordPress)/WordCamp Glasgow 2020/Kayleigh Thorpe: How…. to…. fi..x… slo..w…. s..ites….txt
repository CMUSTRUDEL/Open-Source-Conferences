Hey so look who's in this room isn't it

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,800
okay and us cami said and my name is

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,900
Kaylie and I work for 35 speedo

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,490
which is a hosting company based in

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,199
Manchester and it always throws me off

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,969
because you have to point down this

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,480
would come preparin is the only one

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,570
where I do so yeah part of my day-to-day

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,930
job is answering support cases helping

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,050
people with WordPress websites and one

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,710
of the more broader subjects which comes

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,840
up from time to time is fixing slowness

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,120
on websites and it's one of those really

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,840
iffy topics because there's so many

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,690
reasons it can happen so I'm gonna talk

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,180
about some of the tools that we use to

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,820
help people identify what is slow in

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,890
their website down and how much

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,310
attention we want to pay to certain

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,010
things like that and I want to offer

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,070
some useful tools and tips of things

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,140
that either you can use to try and help

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,270
optimize your website or speak to your

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,520
hosting provider about and hopefully

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,909
take away something that might help you

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,400
get you say a little bit faster and so

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,170
yeah I'll jump into that okay so we're

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,130
gonna start by talking about how we

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,659
identify speed issues and obviously you

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,250
might go to your website and notice that

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,030
it's not quite as fast as you would like

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,740
it to be and or we could do with a bit

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,170
more information than that in most cases

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,780
because just knowing that the site is

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,009
slow doesn't really help us diagnose any

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,469
kind of issue so there's a few this has

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,049
a little bit of a delay and there's a

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,210
few tools that we use on the support

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,060
team to kind of get an impression of

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,659
what's going on and one of the tools

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,519
there

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,090
me and my colleague she was quite

00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:16,440
frequently is the network hub in the

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,030
Chrome browser so friends got a if you

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,090
right-click in chrome on any web page

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,450
you can click inspect and open up some

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,700
useful tools for inspecting websites and

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,920
one of them is the network tab and what

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,069
this does is when you click on the

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,260
network tab in chrome you can reload

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,349
your page and it will give you a

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,690
breakdown of how long it took the

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,299
individual assets of that page to load

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,900
I'll show you how it looks like it looks

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:47,760
a little bit something like this so I am

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,890
on a website I've opened up the network

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,700
tab and I've just refreshed my website

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,190
and it gives me this big list of assets

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,040
for the site tells me how long my site

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,760
my page took to load and then a bunch of

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,819
things things that were loaded on the

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,819
site and you can arrange these into so

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,709
you can arrange them into size and time

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,079
is the one that I usually arrange them

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,599
into because that's how long it took

00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,579
that individual assets logged so based

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,290
on this example I can see that the

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,760
things that took the most time to load

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,340
on my site appeared to be things like

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,910
CSS files JavaScript files and the odd

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,130
image which this is kind of the thing we

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,750
usually see and things like images

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,579
slowing down your website isn't exactly

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:38,549
a surprise but if there's a specific

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:41,280
asset that's taking a long time to load

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,680
and usually the network tab will give us

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,470
a good idea of where we can look for and

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:54,269
making some improvements so that's a

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:56,880
really useful tool similarly to the

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,889
network tab there's other online tools

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,540
you can use to get an idea of what slow

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,000
down your website rather than

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,650
investigating yourself and using

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,010
something like the Chrome networks up

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,099
you can use a website and there's quite

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,019
a few popular ones there's GT metrics

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,190
webpagetest.org and things like

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,690
lighthouse

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,820
I'm gonna show you and these are these

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,260
I'll tell you what they think can be

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,870
done sir improve the speed on your

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,240
website and they're quite useful they'll

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,790
give you some stuff that you might not

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,860
have even thought about and they give

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,330
you a lot of information as well and you

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,770
can try a few of them and you'll find

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,110
that usually they'll give you the kind

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,630
of if something's slowing down your site

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,780
or all of them will probably point to a

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,840
similar kind of corporate so I'm gonna

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:49,710
show an example of a report on the same

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,940
website so I've typed my website into

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:58,440
Google's pages Google's PageSpeed

00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,090
insights there and it I click analyze it

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,790
goes away it takes a look at my website

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,430
and it comes back with a load of

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,250
information and the most prominent thing

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,500
you can see what you go to Google

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,710
PageSpeed and put in your website is the

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,830
big score at the top now I got an 86

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,290
which to me doesn't seem so bad for its

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,590
orange it should be green that's really

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:25,470
upsetting things like that and so

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,720
straight away I'm like okay I would

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,480
quite like a green score and if you

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,880
scroll down on Google PageSpeed insights

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,000
and it'll give you information on white

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,870
thinks is making your score not perfect

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,910
so for me it was things like or not to

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,000
my CSS files things that were being

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,280
loaded and that were being used and it's

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,680
not serving images and specific formats

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,050
and you can click the dropdowns and

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,960
it'll give you suggestions and why

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,580
things will be helpful for your website

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,630
and you can take that information away

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,330
and maybe optimize some images maybe

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,210
install a plugin the which might fix the

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,400
specific issue it's telling you about so

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,960
you could you can run a test like this

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,030
and this is the lighthouse test in

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,460
Chrome which gives you very similar kind

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,700
of

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,310
and this one also does metrics for

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,400
things like your SEO and accessibility

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,290
and things like that and what again if I

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,360
look at this is the same website

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,640
I've still got things the same kind of

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,020
information being displayed so it still

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,390
thinks the things slowing down my

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,920
website is it didn't eat so like minify

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,290
my CSS I'll do something about that

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,480
which this is all the kind of

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,390
information I already know cuz I'd

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,580
checked in my networks having Chrome I'd

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:50,800
used the Google PageSpeed insights so

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,570
having done a few tests I can kind of

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,500
get the impression okay if I do

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,870
something about that

00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,490
that might make a difference and the one

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,590
that I use the most often sorry I'm

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,560
showing you a few of these but this one

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,840
is my favorite and it's webpagetest dark

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,020
and the reason I like this one a bit

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,630
better is because webpagetest.org when

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,460
you type in your website it does three

00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,700
tests on it it loads the page three

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,330
times and it will work out its scores

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:24,490
from that and it also gives you the

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,620
informations a bit in my opinion a bit

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,270
more clear so I've got my scores up here

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,250
which are very nice I like this one

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:34,240
obviously I like this one best cuz it

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,340
gave me all green boy it also gives me

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,280
some in some important metrics at the

00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:43,990
top here so things like my and it sounds

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,430
best by the font content filling the

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:52,540
first content for pay and things like

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:55,360
that and so it's yeah it's also got

00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,310
little taps with more information so

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,830
it's got things like a performance

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,520
review checklist so I can clearly see

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,170
what assets on my site here that

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,600
optimized that thinks I could do a

00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:10,120
compressor and it's got its got really

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,090
clear information format compared to

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,280
other the other tools I feel and it's

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,810
got my waterfall here which shows gives

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,080
me an impression of what is loading

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:23,350
being loaded in at what time

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,690
so what page test has quite a lot of lot

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,160
of information and it's all in different

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:33,370
sections which I just think that's a

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:36,040
little bit nicer and Clara and so with

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,390
these scores and you might put your

00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,930
website in and find out that you've got

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:43,450
this real a lot of school and it can be

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,070
a bit or worrying because you're like oh

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,890
no it's my website really poorly

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,710
optimized and some of it and we get a

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:54,040
lot of customers who run these cabinet

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,660
tests and they might have not quite the

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,760
score they want and they're immediately

00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,770
thinking things like Google are gonna

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,300
kick me off the search engine I'm gonna

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:05,970
be reared ranks really low

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:09,580
oh this is terrible too so stuff and it

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:12,520
it's not asked concerning in most cases

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,830
as they should think it is because half

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,140
the time will go to the website and

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,290
we'll have a look and be like well your

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,420
page loads in like half a second for me

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,190
and are you having is there a specific

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,410
section of the side that slow is it's

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,940
love for you and look up it's fast for

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,980
me but this has given you a really bad

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,540
school and basically and it's there

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,730
might be things going on on your website

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,070
which make this score not as important

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,180
as you think it is because at the end of

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:44,910
day if you start loading fine and fast

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:49,270
then the score might not be everything

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:55,090
for example and I run the PageSpeed test

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:57,490
on Amazon they've got 36 so obviously my

00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,430
site is much better than Amazon and will

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,970
be ranked at the top above Amazon that's

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:06,250
not the case at all but it gives you the

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,440
kind of idea of how important this

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,970
metric can be in some cases I'm not

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,130
saying it's not useful because it

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,900
definitely gives you some insights on

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,730
how you can improve certain aspects of

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,780
your site but if you're chasing after

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,610
the perfect score and you might not

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,440
really need to because as long as your

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,110
page loads and everything loads fine

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,260
Amazon loads in everything on the page

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,460
in like half a second less than nice

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,430
really fast

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,970
and it's super high ranked there's

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:41,870
nothing wrong with Amazon and do

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:44,129
by what this score might say so so yeah

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,410
don't get too worried about the scores

00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:48,449
of the pike use them as more kind of

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:54,000
helpful guidelines on how you can speed

00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:55,980
up your website a lot of people get kind

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,600
of hung up on the time to first byte

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,769
metric as well and I'm just going to

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,439
talk about that and summer and the first

00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,839
content for pain and what these metrics

00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:09,360
are and why they're important so the

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,490
time to first byte is when you're you

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,110
first make a request to the server it's

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,399
when you get that initial response so

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,100
it's how long the server takes to

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,360
respond which is an important metric and

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:24,360
both arguably the more important metric

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,519
I would I would say is the first concept

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,180
of all pain because what this is this is

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,250
when you actually start receiving

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,079
something in the browser so you start

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,810
actually seeing something visual on the

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,970
website so like your images your CSS is

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,889
that's the more user based metric so

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,750
your thumb to first byte might be two

00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:47,279
seconds but then straight after that

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,709
you've got everything else loaded if

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,050
your first content for pain is a lot

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,029
longer than your time to first byte then

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,220
the user experience isn't very good

00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:59,250
because it means that the actual page is

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,100
taking quite a while to load so these

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,230
are the two metrics that are quite

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,939
important once you're looking at what's

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,949
being loaded onto the page and what the

00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:12,930
users experiences and now that we've

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:14,370
gone through a few tools and we've got

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,189
an idea of what's slowing down our

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,279
website potentially and I'm going to go

00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:23,250
through a few easy optimization tips

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,290
that anyone can do and just some little

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,930
bits of things you can do things you can

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:31,139
talk to your host about and yeah

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:35,870
hopefully get the site up to a bit of a

00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,870
higher score but not so happy that boom

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:43,589
so based off my website the big speed

00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:46,529
culprits that I saw and this is usually

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,569
the kind of case that we'll see when we

00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:51,269
run this test on most websites and

00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:54,300
things like unoptimized images images

00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:55,829
count for a lot of slow slow down on

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,380
websites that's not a surprise

00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:02,429
they usually the biggest upsets on the

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:06,179
side and large javascript files and CSS

00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:09,110
files and one that comes up that on when

00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:11,730
I've been talking to customers is an

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,550
external resources being loaded into the

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,990
site so you'll have your website boy you

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,120
might be loaded in a video from an

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:21,209
another website or it might be lured in

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,519
a font from somewhere and so basically

00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,500
your website is also relying on this

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,449
other server to serve something before

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,660
it'll load properly and that can if

00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:32,519
affect your score quite a bit so with

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,679
something like that ideally you'd be

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:40,079
loading in your assets on your actual

00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:43,679
website so just going to talk about some

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,120
easy image optimization plugins so maybe

00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,019
you've not thought about optimizing your

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,429
images making them smaller and there's

00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,709
many plugins that can do this for you

00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,870
and some of the popular ones are jet

00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:57,750
packs both on may be a bit controversial

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,889
because not everyone likes jet pack

00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,189
because it has a lot of other features

00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:05,069
which and sometimes people think might

00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:07,550
slow it down a little bit but it has a

00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:11,309
image optimization tool where you can

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,279
use their seat a jetpack CDN to serve

00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:16,550
the images for you and there's a WP

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,949
smush which compresses your images and

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:22,740
one of the ones I see most often and

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,750
quite liked is the image optimizer

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,339
plug-in because this one you can set

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,920
your own compression settings you can

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:33,350
tell you what you want it to do you can

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:36,720
go back and apply all those optimization

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:39,029
options to your current uploads and then

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,959
it'll do it going forward for new

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:44,069
uploads so it's quite a popular one and

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:46,740
you want to talk to your hosting

00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:49,889
provider about potential serving web P

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,589
images and these are new formats of

00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,130
images that are more optimized for the

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:56,529
web and

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,399
compressed a bit better and they're

00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,360
designed to make the web work faster and

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,300
speak to your hosting provider because

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,180
they can potentially help you set up web

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,620
P images loading onto your website so

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,480
you want to find out a bit more about

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:16,540
things like that as well and if you want

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,949
to do some image optimization before you

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,290
actually get them on your website

00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:21,790
there's some tools here that I've used

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,980
before my favorite one - the one at the

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,529
top which is compressor Dyer and

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,329
basically you just upload the image to

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,829
it and it gives you a more compressed

00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:33,220
version of it it removes things like

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:34,329
metadata it does lossy and lossless

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,990
compression

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:40,449
so basically lossy compression will

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,949
affect the image quality a bit more both

00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:46,839
have a much larger file reduction and

00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:49,480
lossless compression is the opposite ill

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,779
keep the quality of the image or have a

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,410
little bit of a less file size reduction

00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,120
anyway

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,529
I quite liked running for my images

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,290
through that because it's quite a quick

00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:01,149
and easy tool to use of course you can

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,540
also do the old just resize your images

00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:06,850
before you upload them and upload

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,399
reasonably sized images follow up most

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:13,420
websites are usually serving all their

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:16,630
images are 2,000 pixels wide so yeah

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,029
just a few easy ways you can optimize

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,769
your images and if you're you haven't

00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:26,620
been doing this it'll make a big

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:30,399
difference and the other big culprit

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,589
that came up on my website once I was

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,740
getting my reports was they need to

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:37,470
minify my JavaScript and CSS and this is

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,680
really easy to do with a plug-in as well

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:44,649
so what these do is you can get a plugin

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,019
which takes your CSS file and if you've

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:49,480
ever wrote CSS you'll know you make here

00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:52,060
the files look really pretty because

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,160
they're all like in blind down on all

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,149
the different options and they look

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,370
really nice but this basically just

00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:02,589
strings them all down into like one line

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,169
of code and removes all the whitespace

00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:07,659
from them result in a smile

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,639
fire and it's just a really easy way to

00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:13,779
get a little bit of load down on the

00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:16,049
site so there's a few plugins that can

00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:20,709
do this some some themes do this as well

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:24,279
but the plugins that I've seen auto

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:26,139
optimized WP super minify and WP fastest

00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,819
cache will all do this and there's

00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:32,619
plenty of other plugins that will do

00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:34,299
this as well and something you want to

00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,919
talk to your hosting provider about is

00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:41,470
making sure that your traffic is being

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,690
served over HTTP - so HTTP - is an

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,499
upgrade to the current HTTP protocol

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:49,059
which when you visit a website and

00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:51,399
you're requesting packets from that

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,139
website and they're sending them one

00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:56,859
after another opening that connection

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:58,869
back and forth it's a kind of a hard one

00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:01,480
to explain properly but I am the

00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:03,909
difference with HTTP - is when you open

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,489
that first request it keeps the stream

00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:09,789
open so more so everything keeps going

00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:12,999
keeps being transferred and it's faster

00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:17,529
for that reason so you want your hosting

00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:19,239
to be giving you this service it needs

00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,159
an SSL to work which is also good

00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:24,249
because everyone should be having an SSL

00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,499
and it also kind of gets rid of that

00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:30,730
myth that SSL slow your site down

00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:31,960
because if you've got an SSL and HTTP to

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,720
running because of that your site is

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,600
faster then when it didn't have the SSL

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,320
and it's more secure which is great and

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:47,799
Google does like SSL so every site

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:50,980
should have an SSL basically another

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:54,600
popular way of reducing side load time

00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:57,220
is to sell caching and caching is a bit

00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,909
caching is awesome but it's also really

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:07,480
not awesome because anyway what caching

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:10,600
does is it distracting and caching

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,749
rather than every time you load up a web

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,390
page and you get the individual assets

00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:18,440
and you load up

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:20,810
page caching kind of stuff it takes the

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,390
image of the full page and stores it in

00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,550
memory so when you visit the website if

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:29,300
it's cached it will just whip it out of

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:33,350
memory and display it faster

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:35,090
now that's really handy or it can be a

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,300
little bit confusing sometimes because

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:41,120
if you're developing a website and you

00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,500
make a change and then you go back to

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,110
the website sometimes you find things

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,600
like the changes disappear things like

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,130
that that's usually because the cache

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,420
hasn't been flourished things like that

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,290
so you do have to be a little bit

00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:56,810
careful with it

00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:58,550
most caching stuff will not affect the

00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,750
logged in user and it's more something

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:04,520
the logged out users will experience but

00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,050
there's two ways you can cut you can

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,810
manage caching your hosting provider

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,870
might prefer might provide server level

00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:13,610
caching so you might want to speak to

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,620
them about whether or not they are doing

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,200
that because if your hosting providers

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,840
already handling your cache by your

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,150
website and if you have something like a

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,270
plug-in you can have two caches and that

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,740
can get things really confusing and if

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,620
you don't already have caching though

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,540
you can set up with a plug-in and these

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,120
are three of the popular ones so it'll

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:39,650
be free total cache WP rocket and WP

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,630
fastest cache and yeah because because

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,340
of how this works and stores the web

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,400
page in memory it'll speed up your

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,690
website and it's really good so yeah

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,370
it's worth speaking to your hosting

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,110
provider about which option is best for

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:55,550
you and whoever I'm not they're already

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:57,560
providing me with it I'm just going to

00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,840
go through some other reasons why a

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,450
website might be slow because these are

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,610
the kind of usual things we see and easy

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:09,320
optimization tips that anyone can do or

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,920
your website might have a great score

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,590
and be more or less buying all the time

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,090
well there's some other instances where

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,730
the sides going slow and the Year issue

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,920
isn't quite as clear so I'm just going

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,919
to go through some problems that might

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,629
be the case and what

00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:29,940
we can do about them so because this is

00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:31,409
WordPress one of the main reasons the

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,769
site might be going a little bit slower

00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:37,619
than we would want it to is because it

00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:40,559
might have too many plugins when I say

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:43,889
too many plugins having a lot of plugins

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,869
isn't always a bad thing but um from my

00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:49,169
experience working with WordPress

00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:52,279
support quite a bit and we'll see a lot

00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:55,230
of websites with a lot of plugins and

00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,659
there'll be instances where half the

00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,100
plugins are disabled and they're not

00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,480
kept up to date because there's so many

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,960
plugins and they're not needed so

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,409
they're not kept lots of day and so you

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,629
can get your site into a little bit of a

00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:12,239
load mess because just because there's

00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,929
so many plugins and stuff or no no real

00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,899
good reason

00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:18,029
and if you've got a lot of disabled

00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:19,950
plugins as well they usually do have

00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:22,259
some sort of data still on the site that

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,629
might be being loaded in and causing

00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,909
problems so things like database table

00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:28,409
entries making your database not saying

00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:31,350
things like that if you've got a lot of

00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:33,149
them just sitting there darman and it's

00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,399
a really easy fix though because the fix

00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:38,609
is to just make sure that your plugins

00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:39,989
are being regularly updated and get rid

00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,059
of ones that you don't using but

00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:43,230
actually delete them don't just disable

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,999
them and leave them on the site for

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,609
forever if you're not using the plug-in

00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:49,470
there's no point in having it and if you

00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:51,950
do decide you need it again you can just

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,950
reinstall it

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:59,009
so yeah just do regular plug-in audits

00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,989
and make sure that the plugins you are

00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:04,590
using are being kept up to date as well

00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:06,269
because one of the things where plugins

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,669
that could be a problem is the code

00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:11,299
might be really out of date for a plugin

00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:13,769
that's not been updated in several years

00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:15,840
that might be the case then plug it

00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:19,169
might be fine from the get-go as well

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,159
for ya just make sure that the plugins

00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:22,320
on your site are the ones that you

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:27,239
actually need and it'll be a lot better

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:30,269
fire and another thing that slows down

00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:33,020
sites unrelated to anything we've been

00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:36,770
through is denial of service attack

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:40,400
and this is when and another computer a

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:42,290
bark things like that will make lots of

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,880
requests to your website in quick

00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:48,980
succession so for example a script our

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,800
robot trying to log into your WordPress

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,840
admin really fast brute force attacks

00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,450
where they just try to get the password

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,920
and all that all those guesses in quick

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,679
succession will run up your memory

00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,140
making you stack slow so things like

00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,540
this can be a little less obvious

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,420
because most of the time you just see

00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,920
the end result where the website is

00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,040
really slow and you can't see this

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:17,059
personnel but whatever trying to log in

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,230
and usually you can report something

00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:20,300
like this to your hosting provider

00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,160
they'll check your access logs and

00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,610
they'll find out why that's happening

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,720
and found out that that's the case and

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,840
it's another one that's not too

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,520
difficult to kinda start out in most

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,870
cases your hosting providers probably

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,179
got you set up with some sort of

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,550
protection for this so something like

00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:40,220
fail to ban on the server which will ban

00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:43,520
IP addresses after they try to do dodgy

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,620
requests a few too many signs and you

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,450
can install a plug-in called limit login

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,059
attempts which does the same thing for

00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:53,929
the login page and you can set up things

00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:56,800
like HT access rules on your website

00:24:53,929 --> 00:25:01,040
which you can target specific files and

00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,690
limit the access to them so that's the

00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,480
kind of thing you can do to prevent this

00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,830
kind of problem and it might be

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,500
something to talk to your hosting

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,940
provider about BA and you can install

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,280
plugins which we'll take a look as well

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,660
and the security plugins like wordfence

00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,760
and things like that which have these

00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,660
kind of tools in them so you can look

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,660
into stuff like that

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:27,980
DDoS attacks and the worst reason your

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,410
sound might be slow is that it might be

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,150
hacked and hopefully this is not the

00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,309
case because this is the worst case

00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,370
scenario and it really sucks when your

00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:38,860
site's been hacked and sometimes it's

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,020
not very obvious that you

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,820
it's been hacked you might just find

00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,980
that it's slow on daily it might not be

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,429
slower off but this is one of the

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,980
reasons why your site could be slow and

00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:52,929
there's not really agree amount that can

00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,299
be done about it other than cleaning up

00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:58,270
the hack and so this is why taking

00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:00,000
backups is important and hacks can slow

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,140
down your website by doing things like

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,299
installing scripts on your website which

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,830
are attacking other sites they use a

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:09,760
pull up memory they can be sending out

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:12,910
spam mail so it's one of those

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,679
possibilities and the solution is either

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,799
to restore from a backup when the side

00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,900
wasn't hacked but even then the

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,520
vulnerability could still exist so it's

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,140
best speaking to someone about getting a

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,780
proper cleanup on your website

00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,850
getting fresh with version C plugins

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,860
installed where the hack is definitely

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,570
not present and going through that

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,580
process this is the worst case scenario

00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,520
and hopefully that's not why any one

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:43,090
site is slow because it's real pain when

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:45,669
your site's hacked and another thing to

00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:49,270
talk to your host about is what kind of

00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:53,770
hosting your up and this is fairly

00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:55,570
straightforward so we've we've won quite

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,790
a lot of websites they might be using

00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,059
either shared hosting or VPS based

00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:03,549
hosting and on shared hosting you're in

00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,400
a server space with other clients web

00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:08,830
sites so does this server and all these

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,410
web sites are on it and including your

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,000
website and you don't really know these

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,490
other websites that you're sharing the

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,320
server space with and one of them might

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,510
be a really busy shop website that

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,169
probably should be on its own hosting

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,549
book because shared hosting is usually

00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:29,260
that bit cheaper quite a lot of people

00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:30,610
go for it and if your sites quite if the

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,950
speed of your website is quite critical

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:34,390
to your business then you don't want

00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,880
these other websites on the server

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,389
taking up all that memory the resource

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,989
on the

00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:42,820
resources on the server so what you can

00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:46,119
do is you can switch to VPS based

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,769
hosting and that service base which you

00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,109
were sharing the bunch of websites with

00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:52,959
and now you're in your own container

00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:56,469
space you've got your own resources that

00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:59,649
are specifically for your website and no

00:27:56,469 --> 00:28:04,539
other website can take take up some of

00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:06,969
the memory and not let you have it so if

00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:08,409
you're if speed is really important to

00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:11,109
your website you definitely want to be

00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:14,649
looking at containerized VPS space coast

00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:16,139
in and usually it's not as dearer as you

00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:19,239
might think

00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:21,119
so yeah that's definitely one of the

00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:28,419
better options for keeping your site up

00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:31,179
quite fast regular and finally so

00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:33,969
because solving speed issues is quite

00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:37,209
difficult because there's so many

00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:39,129
different reasons it can happen so if

00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:41,889
you if you're using a hosting provider

00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:43,690
with a support line there's useful

00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:45,879
details that you can get farther to help

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,519
them kind of help you figure out what's

00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:50,139
going on and a lot of the time it's just

00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,179
a case of going through PageSpeed tests

00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:54,159
and we can give advice on what kind of

00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:56,950
things a slow and down your website that

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,079
you can do but when it's a little bit

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,789
less clear when something a bit weird is

00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,919
going on there's some useful information

00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:05,589
that you can grab for us I'll make note

00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:08,889
of and usually the kind of information

00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:11,200
that helps identify speed issues is the

00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:13,719
time the slowdown happened so if it's

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,839
not a constant thing if your site slows

00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:19,599
down every day at 3 a.m. for some weird

00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:21,359
reason and that's definitely useful to

00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,889
us because we can check things like

00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,450
error logs access logs see if there was

00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:27,609
anything running on the server at that

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:31,359
time see if there was issues on the hook

00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:33,279
side at that time and so knowing when

00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,469
the issue happens is really important

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,909
and it might be happening on a specific

00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:38,979
section of the website

00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:41,499
maybe that section of the website only

00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:44,169
has things like maybe it's your videos

00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:45,010
page which is particularly slow which my

00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:46,840
point

00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:51,250
the issue things like that might be

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:53,559
helpful can we replicate the issue is

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,360
usually they're really helpful one cuz

00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,730
if we can see the same issue you're

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,520
having it helps us go away and kind of

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:03,580
keep trying things and help identify

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,280
where the issue is coming from and yeah

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,130
if you can take away as much information

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,960
about unclear speed issues as you can it

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,970
really helps your hosting provider

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:48,780
provide you with the assistance you need

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:48,780
to get back up to speed and yeah yes

00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:57,780
um it differs for every website because

00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,520
because based on your WordPress theme

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,860
you might have different kind of

00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,280
thumbnail sizes that and your images

00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,720
might be being served up different at

00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,330
different sizes on different parts of

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,190
your website when you upload an image to

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:14,130
WordPress it usually divides them up

00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,780
into those thumbnail sizes and so

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:19,440
there's no kind of set you should be

00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,330
uploading at this size you want to make

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,730
sure that your themes doing the

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:27,240
thumbnails right and not say you don't

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,310
like it mm pixel image boy it's actually

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,190
on the website being served a hundred

00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:34,680
pixels wide there's no mind having that

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:38,540
you just have the smaller image on the

00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,540
website uploaded and being served

00:31:52,120 --> 00:32:04,750
I plan to finally people sighs yeah and

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,640
that's why are you doing something I

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,160
imagine that's perfectly fine you can

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,810
always try taking the image that you've

00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,090
got to mind yourself and seeing what

00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:15,460
something like compressor dial can add

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,320
to it and because I'm not sure if

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,150
Photoshop removes things like the

00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:29,140
metadata from the picture and things

00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:30,400
like that yeah and so yeah that's say

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,720
give it a try but as long as you're

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,730
doing something it's a lot better than

00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,210
doing nothing if you're uploading a lot

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:45,940
especially things like large photography

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:47,650
website type images not really my kind

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,460
of advice would be to serve it from

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:54,850
YouTube because chances are YouTube's

00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:57,310
server whatever video streaming service

00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:00,280
you use it is probably a lot faster and

00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:04,330
optimized for serving videos because

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,800
videos are really huge and yes serving

00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:09,210
them from your host server is usually

00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,210
not the best option in most cases

00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:28,750
I say yes you there's all the I'm trying

00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:37,530
to think of a better replies until

00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:40,270
you're kind off I think something and

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,530
honestly I'm not so if they don't want

00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,800
to get rid of the project maybe you can

00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:46,660
offer alternatives and but yeah if you

00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,030
found a specific plug-in is slowing down

00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,410
the website the plug-in slowing down the

00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,880
website I don't know if you can contact

00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,690
the developer and get them to do

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,680
anything about that

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,030
and or when the corporate is cleared

00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,590
there's not a lot you can do especially

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,590
if they refuse to get rid of it

00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:07,150
yeah yeah yeah I wish there was a Oh

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,530
press this button and it'll just make

00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,530
the crap plug in not Kraft

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,070
that's a good question

00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:35,530
networks up you know do you know where

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:38,020
it shows you that and all doesn't just

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:42,820
show me oh let's go back maybe you show

00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:44,940
me because usually that's the kind of

00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:49,929
thing we check on the server side so

00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:58,270
let's have a look one of these columns

00:34:49,929 --> 00:35:00,970
will tell you if you go along hopefully

00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:23,080
it should tell ya add try and get an

00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:24,730
example but we don't know and CSS

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,720
magnification Java C we checked about

00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:32,320
any 170 cannot make your PHP or do

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:35,700
something on the server side and then

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,700
all said well that's impossible

00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:59,829
well it depends on what kind of hosting

00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,479
your own cousin in most cases if you

00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:03,940
aren't shared hosting they probably

00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:05,529
won't do that for you because it might

00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,259
affect all the websites on the server

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:09,849
but if you're if you're on VPS based

00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:11,469
hosting some of them will install

00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:14,769
certain modules and things like that far

00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:20,680
and potentially obviously I can't speak

00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:22,150
for what hosted packager Amin depends on

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,109
what you're after if you have WordPress

00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:27,819
hosting there's a bunch of cool

00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:30,459
optimization stuff on it and but yet

00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:32,140
most of our VPS based hosting we can

00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:36,309
make certain customizations that

00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:38,440
customers want and I I would assume

00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:40,269
that's a similar case for most places as

00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,489
long as you're it's not affecting other

00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:47,859
people's websites who potentially might

00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:49,329
not want yeah yeah I'd be surprised if

00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:51,959
they installed anything you wanted on

00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,959
shared hosting

00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:01,249
