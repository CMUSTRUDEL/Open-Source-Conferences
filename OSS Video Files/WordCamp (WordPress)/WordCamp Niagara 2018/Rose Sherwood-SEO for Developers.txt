is the consortium behind the HTML

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,550
standard so they're in charge of making

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,920
all the rules about how HTML operates

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,389
for every browser different browsers

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,969
implement them a little differently

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,599
that's where cross compatibility issues

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,750
come from

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,990
but generally w3c standards are the ones

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,119
you always want to uphold so w3c has a

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,390
validation checker all right so you take

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,580
a website you put the address in w3c

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,779
goes through and says hey this is good

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,510
hey this is bad

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,340
this is really important for your Google

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,520
search rankings I worked with a company

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,120
a local electronics company their

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,550
websites massive they had 500 products

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,610
listed they had no search result

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,370
visibility and it's not for a lack of

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,559
content they had images they had writing

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,989
they had specs they had PDF downloads

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,329
they had all this content guess what

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,340
though what they didn't know was under

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,649
the hood they were throwing tons of

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,840
errors errors make your website look bad

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,510
Google doesn't want to recommend a badly

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,170
built website so that's where the w3c

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,049
comes in so what we did was we corrected

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,450
all the w3c errors on their website

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,119
within a month they were rating ahead of

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,960
Best Buy in electronic search results

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,229
right just that minor change brought

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,700
about that major shift in signals so w3c

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,020
standards major tip there next we're

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,360
going to talk about the building blocks

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:39,060
we talked about the HTML blocks so

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,280
semantic hTML is part of html5 right so

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,100
hTML is your tags your paragraph tags

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,320
your image tags your link tags these are

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,780
similar these are structural elements

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,759
these are all about machine readability

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,630
so what you're doing is you're staying

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,090
to the spiders that crawl your website

00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:00,540
this is my introduction this is a group

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,790
of elements these are links right so

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,680
these are all different aspects so that

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,540
when the spiders crawl your website they

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,090
can identify what's in it

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,160
you can't force the spider to agree with

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,400
you you know if I wrap my links in an

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,489
aside

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,049
it's it's gonna know that I'm it's not

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:18,400
gonna say oh that is complementary

00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,750
content necessarily it's going to

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,849
register that you're using that tag

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,090
incorrectly which isn't great for your

00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:28,420
scores so you know you can't just force

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,720
it but if you do use these correctly you

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,879
do get better ratings so on the right

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,280
here we've got a simple layout your nav

00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,319
is usually in your header your sections

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,970
are usually in your articles your aside

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:46,840
is nearby and your footer is usually at

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:48,569
the bottom text element so do you guys

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,000
know about have you heard of the graphs

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,700
the social graph the knowledge graph the

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,510
trust graph not seeing anybody not okay

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,069
so Google uses different analytics than

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,650
it used to a long time ago so it used to

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,569
use PageRank of real hard of PageRank

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,900
right the scoring system quality

00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:10,269
Authority that kind of thing is all

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,250
about keywords right so the new graphs

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:16,150
that Google is using are the knowledge

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,340
graph to rate based on based on their

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,160
knowledge of things how closely are you

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,980
in line with what is the standard right

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,290
there's the trust graph what's your

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,470
credibility like there's the social

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,440
graph right and I haven't actually seen

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,680
it documented but there is suspicion

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,109
that there's a sentiment graph sentiment

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,169
being so on Facebook great there's six

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,750
emotions you know you can you can love

00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:46,720
you can be surprised you can be angry

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,310
that's sentiment analysis in AI machine

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,910
learning so we get a little off-topic

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:55,569
here the text elements denote emphasis

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:58,060
based on tone right so they're in line

00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,470
with the sentiment of your content see

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,109
what I'm saying like it's the emotional

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,290
tone of your content am I making sense

00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:07,829
here okay I know I'm trying to explain

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,889
something that is just like so out there

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,629
so we've got these tags the B and the I

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,720
tag were actually deprecated at one

00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:18,699
point they're back so deprecated meaning

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,859
that people weren't using them they are

00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,570
not deprecated anymore they do actually

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,970
denote something structural you under

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,350
the html5 standards

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,280
else we have to cover here

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,810
oh yeah the delete in the insert tag so

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,390
this just lends credibility to your

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,270
writing when you use these correctly

00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,940
right says that hey look at me I'm being

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,530
specific hey look at me I'm being honest

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,420
I removed this because it was inaccurate

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:51,260
right some navigation stuff to cover

00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:55,040
here so hyperlinks we all know standard

00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:58,400
hyperlink those fit within major nobs

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,340
menus are more like buttons this is

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,360
important for screen readers

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,870
accessibility is a concern on the

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Internet

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,850
right like everybody is trending towards

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,950
more accessible websites Google monitors

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,510
that right so if your website is

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,170
accessible it'll get promoted over a

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:19,310
similar website that's less accessible

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:21,020
so for accessibility purposes use a menu

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,840
with a group of form controls with your

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,240
buttons use nav with major not links and

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,250
just a handy tag to know download when

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,630
you're doing a download this is really

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,550
hard to do without my notes I'm trying

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,630
my best here right so the relationship

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,620
attributes this is just bonus

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:45,080
information there used to be an author

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,860
attribute it's no longer relevant they

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,230
are not allowing people to declare their

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,990
authorship and create an author profile

00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:57,140
via Google+ anymore they're doing it

00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,260
differently authorship is determined

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,900
through the social graph so okay Twitter

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,420
right Twitter people are sharing their

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:09,650
links right Google is indexing Twitter

00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:11,870
at a rate of 10 times so 10 times per

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,640
second it's 10 times per second or 10

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:18,010
times per minute it's a ridiculous rate

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:21,260
right there also indexing Instagram

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:24,500
that's the social graph right so we used

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:28,460
to use a tag called author that was on

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,230
the link attributes we don't use that

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,700
anymore we use the social graph to prove

00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,910
that we were the author to connect it

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:38,000
with our identity this is I'm getting a

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:42,200
lot of like confused looks am i rambling

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,380
a little too fast no okay good keep

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,050
going so images proper image takes today

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,620
are denoted not just as images as

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,880
figures and figures with captions so

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,530
this one not a lot of people seem to

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,930
know the difference between the alt and

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,180
the title tag it's subtle but if you can

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,280
do it properly if you can capture this

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,650
nuance it is appreciated by the Google

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,220
search engine it's very very simple

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,920
right the alt is the replacement text

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,680
for the image right so over here I've

00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,950
got my example say we've got Jun it's a

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,380
calendar of Jun the alt is Jun is a

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,230
summer month with 30 days right this

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,870
describes Jun right so for a screen

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,150
reader that can't see the image we have

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,210
that descriptive text of here's Jun this

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:32,030
is what Jun is right then we've got the

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,520
title that's a summary of the image to

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,680
see we're saying is it it's subtle it's

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,840
nuanced right so we've got the example

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,090
of the title month of June that's the

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,030
summary this is the month of June the

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:48,530
alt is what is that all right so this

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,120
it's a very nuanced understanding this

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,530
is big with screen readers screen

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,080
readers are big for accessibility

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,550
accessibility wins major points because

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,010
not a lot of people are doing it or

00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,150
doing it properly so it's a great area

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,430
to explore if you're looking for SEO

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:10,160
tips figure in figure caption they're

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:12,740
they're fairly self-explanatory I'm just

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,090
going to touch on this briefly we do it

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:21,320
for time ok we're good so input types so

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:24,740
in HTML their forms form have forms have

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:28,220
inputs inputs our text text area buttons

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,280
that can operate the form in html5 we

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,830
came out with specific input types these

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,360
are really important on mobile like if

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,190
you're building you're not building

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,260
mobile that's kind of ridiculous

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,849
nowadays if you're building mobile and

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,320
you're not using specific input types

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:46,339
you're putting a lot of weight on your

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,160
users and I'll show you why so here's a

00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:51,980
color picker for color right

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,870
so when a user goes to enter a color

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,180
into a form they don't have to look up

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,920
the hex color of a color code they've

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,220
got a palette chooser right and this

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,390
appears on a desktop or laptop as well

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,940
as on a cell phone

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,070
super handy built into browsers same

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,020
with date/time we don't have to do all

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:14,480
of the validation that we use to on date

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,870
and time right now we've got a date/time

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,670
picker

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,640
it enters it into a standard format

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,470
that's fabulous on a cell phone because

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,830
typing all those numbers out is really

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,660
annoying it's got a couple more this is

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:31,250
the email one so you notice it's got the

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,860
@ sign right versus just a number it

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,620
just pops the number keyboard right

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:40,570
subtle variation in input types huge win

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:43,570
for mobile users huge bonus points a

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,400
couple more the range is handy

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,190
automatically makes the slider telephone

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,130
number right no tiny buttons for people

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,140
to aim for nice big buttons and again

00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:00,020
just accessibility and mobile

00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:01,790
responsiveness great bonus points these

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,780
search in the website so the website's

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:07,880
got the dot-com ready to go right so

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,440
that covers form controls and keep

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,940
moving I'm just gonna briefly mention

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:17,030
these here citations I thought I had an

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:21,380
image with this citations reference a

00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:23,330
title of work right these are huge if

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,190
you're watching the search results that

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,110
are coming up when you're on the

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,060
internet you're gonna start seeing if

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,860
you haven't noticed already more and

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,650
more articles are referencing other

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,780
articles right does anybody else notice

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,850
that trend have you seen that Yeah right

00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:41,330
this is the next big thing right if

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,360
you're not referencing your sources your

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,820
writing has very little credibility so

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:51,020
bonus points if you can reference a book

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,970
off google play those are all indexed if

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,490
you reference a work that is already

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,140
reading well in Google bonus points and

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,440
you want to use your citation tag for

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,209
that wherever possible just to say

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,980
just to say to the spider hey look I'm

00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:05,940
referencing this is a reference check it

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,480
out it'll validate that independently

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,519
block quotes

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,050
those are cool it's just just a little

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:19,029
bonus to be using them correctly what's

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:21,100
up yeah definitely I think there is an

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,970
attribute like you can use the app do

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,370
remember earlier when I was talking

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,810
about the attributes for the links there

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,220
might be a valid attribute for that I

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,660
don't have them memorized

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,339
I'm just make sure you get it

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,139
appropriate but I would definitely use

00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:35,279
the citation tag that's what it's there

00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,279
for good

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:44,829
so Google it's I don't have proof of

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,449
this this is my guy my gut is that

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,180
Google likes that when you interact with

00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:51,579
other Google properties right so I know

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,500
YouTube videos on a page rate better

00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:55,029
than a Vimeo video on a page right

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,879
because you're referencing a Google

00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:01,750
property so books that are indexed are

00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,730
on Google Play are even Google's

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,899
repository of knowledge so if you

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,029
reference something there they can

00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,100
validate that you just won mad

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:13,899
credibility right see what I'm saying

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,360
yeah um so if you want to highlight

00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:19,120
there's a mark tag do gauges with the

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,040
meter tag implementing these doesn't

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,660
really get you credibility doesn't

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,800
really get you any kind of content score

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,290
what it is is it shows you're

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,089
technically able to do things properly

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,189
you're technically proficient you're

00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:31,509
building your website well right so

00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:32,949
they're just kind of little bonus tags

00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:37,720
to throw in there to say hey look I do

00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:40,990
things right all right any questions on

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,750
semantic HTML I'm talking fairly quickly

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,120
I'm aware doing my best to pace myself I

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,259
get so excited

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,259
all right cool we're gonna keep going

00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:52,779
then so website performance so

00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:55,360
performance is little things like how

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:56,860
does a website load does it load quickly

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,600
does it look properly does it load

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:05,079
everything and that's measured by page

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,569
speed there are several metrics around

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,980
how fast a website loads I'm not going

00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:10,959
to get into all the details of those I'm

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,260
going to talk generally about what you

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,220
can do for WordPress

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:19,820
because that's what we're here for um so

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,280
some considerations are is the hosting

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,110
provider hosting your wordpress site so

00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,470
that's your Bluehost that's your dream

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,160
host that's your what is a gator there's

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,530
a gator hosts GoDaddy media drive

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,220
they're another sponsor so that's who's

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:39,350
got the files for your website right are

00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,730
they providing good access to the

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,740
Internet because different hosting

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,870
providers have different access speeds

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,570
to the world wide web right they're not

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,550
all paying for the same traffic you know

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,530
it's the 407 versus the public highway

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,540
out there so if your hosting provider is

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,060
cheaping out putting too many people on

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,770
a box not paying for a decent connection

00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,370
you're going to get poor response times

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:03,050
so at the hosting it can all go wrong

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,660
the other area it can go wrong big-time

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,490
is the local network people are on their

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,680
cell phones and they only have a 3G

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,660
connection you've got a massive website

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,070
it's just not gonna it's not gonna look

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,720
quickly there's nothing you can do about

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,670
that so that's another area for

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,880
bottlenecking and then there's how you

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:22,930
build your web page so that's things

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:27,160
like where is your code loading and how

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:29,000
it's little complex and we'll get there

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,610
so we're going to start talking about

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,740
some testing tools we can use these are

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:38,470
my favorite page checkers so what have

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,390
we got here

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,400
so wave and a checker for accessibility

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,560
if you care at all about accessibility

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,120
even from I want to score well for

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,580
accessibility and get better exposure

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,020
kind of standpoint you want to check

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:57,650
these two out wave will tell you do your

00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:00,170
images all have alt tags yes no are

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,150
using your headings correctly right like

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:07,970
headings should be laid out H 1 to H 2

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:11,300
to H 3 and back up right a checker gets

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,770
a little more detailed it's just a

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,030
personal preference I run things through

00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,290
both because they both have like

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,090
different warnings and different

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,300
cautions so it's worth it to take the

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,590
time for for checking your accessibility

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,460
I'm trying to remember which of the two

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,720
one of them has settings so you can say

00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,870
WCAG

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,270
2.0 WCAG 1.0 and it'll check

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:34,060
specifically versus that standard so if

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:37,990
you have a client say Government of

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,490
Canada is all wcag 2.0 standard so if

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,380
you had a Government of Canada client

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,960
you could say check my website and make

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,820
sure it's all WCAG 2 right that's the

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,910
that's the international standards on

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,220
accessibility so for some page load

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,960
times we've got these two they'll just

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,430
tell you quickly how fast is my page

00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,540
download right the metric for comparison

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,370
there's that you want to be three

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,240
seconds or less to hold the users

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:07,600
attention the metric google uses in its

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,900
Google insights test is seven seconds or

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,850
less so the average page loads in seven

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,500
seconds that's not actually good because

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,140
the attention span is three seconds

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,240
that's the state of the internet but if

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,860
you're below seven seconds you're

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,950
actually ahead of the game compared to

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:28,030
the rest of the Internet so you'll get

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,670
some scores on that Google insights will

00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:33,100
give you specifics on how you're

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,890
performing to Google standards that's

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,600
pretty handy and it'll tell you are your

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:42,820
images caching we'll talk about that

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,730
later on our image is caching are your

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,800
CSS files taking too long should your

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,960
JavaScript be loaded differently it'll

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,930
point all that out to you so if you're

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,460
more of a wordpress user and less of a

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,350
developer it's something you can say to

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,330
your developer hey this isn't this isn't

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,730
being done let's get in line with these

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,770
standards right so that one's a good one

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:08,900
for that these two are a little more

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:13,490
technical any questions cool

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:17,809
oh here I'll tell you what I'll put it

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,220
on my website I'll put these at the

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,209
front so you guys can grab them if you

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:27,530
want I'll put them up on my website

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:29,350
tonight so you can all get copies all

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,750
right performance tuning with WordPress

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,790
so some cool things for images right

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,920
images are one of the longer things to

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,590
load so what you can do with images is

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,160
compress them right like there are ways

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:45,410
that on the back end and take your image

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,120
you compress it like you get a zip

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,550
folder right everybody knows what zip

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,559
folders right so you compress it like

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,730
you would with a zip folder unzip it on

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:57,080
the front end right compressed images

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,440
also with compression you're looking at

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,330
on a mobile browser you don't want to

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,540
you don't need a 1200 pixel wide image

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,920
on a mobile browser right there's no

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,559
there's no point in doing that so

00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,929
compression plugins will do that all for

00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,059
you automatically these are the three

00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:15,500
that are recommended just based on

00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:20,480
talking to people we've got some options

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:22,520
for you there when it comes to plugins I

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,650
mean buyer beware check your sources

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,030
make sure it's the right fit for you if

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,830
you're more technical you might want

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,090
more Advanced Options if you're less

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,380
technical you might want something

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,600
that's just plug and play

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,950
so with plugins just check out the free

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,500
versions before you pay for anything

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,910
make sure it's a good fit for you

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,179
otherwise there are definitely many

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:44,420
options in the compression market this

00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:46,100
is something to look at I think it yeah

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,860
it is just called lazy load that's not a

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,990
right okay so lazy loading this is

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,240
really interesting concept and for

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,150
anyone who's not aware as you're

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,460
scrolling down a web page lazy loading

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,040
is only getting the images you're about

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,840
to scroll to right so that's great

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,670
because then if somebody only goes

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,740
halfway down the page you're not wasting

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,530
time loading all that data making your

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,720
pages jitter or wasting their mobile

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,030
data so there is a plugin called lazy

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,500
load all you do is plug it in and this

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,900
this happens on your whole WordPress

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,210
site like it's all sat ready to go so

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,519
that one's pretty handy

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:30,789
it's bottle up your page speed score

00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:33,219
that'll up your Google score yes yes yes

00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:34,179
compress them all and manage bringing

00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,739
them back I haven't actually used

00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:38,619
clouding area I'm gonna be honest with

00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:40,659
you I know it does and manages image

00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:45,219
compression I know it does it on a large

00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:47,469
scale there's a how what do they do

00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:49,659
there's a motorcycle organization out of

00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:52,869
Hamilton that's using it they have one

00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:55,029
page this page has like 500 images of

00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:56,559
individual people on motorcycles it's a

00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:59,529
pledge people are taking about

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:02,649
motorcycle safety right the page loads

00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:04,419
like that and it's using quaternary so I

00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:06,940
can recommend cloud Neri for you no

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,719
problem but if you want to check details

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,239
you're gonna have to check it out

00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:16,119
yourself anybody else okay alright so

00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:19,029
last second tips is a little more

00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:20,499
technical so you always want to load

00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:23,469
your JavaScript at the end of the page

00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:25,149
unless it has to be loaded at the top so

00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:28,029
what that looks like with WordPress is

00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:30,909
on a very deep technical level are they

00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:34,570
using the WordPress in queue with defer

00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:36,719
set to true so when you're loading

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,909
JavaScript on the back end of WordPress

00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:42,039
they use WordPress in queue or your hard

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:44,200
coding it into your theme then you just

00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,639
put it at the bottom right but a

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,210
standard WordPress theme will use

00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:51,219
WordPress in queue and there is and

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:53,679
what's the word for that anyways you can

00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:55,389
set defer to true defer to true loads it

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,519
at the bottom of the page what that

00:20:55,389 --> 00:21:00,099
means is when your page is loading the

00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,839
HTML loads the CSS loads it looks good

00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:04,119
people can interact with it and then the

00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,009
JavaScript loads right and JavaScript

00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,469
can be a pretty good chunk of a website

00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:09,849
so that way it doesn't slow down the

00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:11,739
loading of the content that people are

00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:14,019
gonna see so it keeps people engaged

00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:17,049
right so of loading javascript at the

00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:19,839
end of the page very handy this is a

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:22,599
newer one so we used to be that more

00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,119
pages was a better score more pages is

00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:29,969
no longer a better score better scores

00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,969
are going to well written well organized

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,430
well written well-organized and like

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,080
engaging content so you want to have

00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,880
videos you want to have images you wanna

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,980
have links to other pages you want to

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,940
have a table of contents and then you

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:49,780
want to have a gigantic page right

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:52,780
there's a guy who teaches HTML and his

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,640
website is indexed third for learn HTML

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,990
he's linked to at the end of the

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,450
presentation if you want to see somebody

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,460
doing really solid SEO he actually has a

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,590
separate menu for every section of his

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,690
website he doesn't have a generic nav

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,090
menu that does his whole site every

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,730
section of the site you go to loads a

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,990
menu that's different that way the

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:16,420
navigation is really simple and

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:20,980
straightforward to the category so ya

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:23,170
longer pages vs. many short pages key

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,850
wording and relevance are really an

00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:30,040
outdated concept it's more about the

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:32,410
knowledge graph the engagement some

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,580
minify if you're looking at a wordpress

00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,770
theme are they minifying they're

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,300
JavaScript and CSS I'm if you're

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,100
building your own you know what are you

00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,980
using implement the right things make

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,510
good choices browser caching I don't

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,090
know too much about browser caching I

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:50,440
know I have a plugin that I turn on and

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:52,480
it works so buyer beware see DNS for

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,430
common elements make sure you're not

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,610
using an overused CDN if you're sharing

00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:01,810
a CDN like I know I was using tailwind

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:05,140
and they're load times for stuff coming

00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:08,370
off their CDN really like sketchy but

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:12,610
otherwise CDNs gets you bonus points and

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:15,780
some references this is all good good

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:20,890
stuff this is where I got my information

00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:21,160
for this oh it's okay go ahead do your

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,350
thing

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:28,840
so Shay how over there he is the third

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:31,110
rated for learn HTML in Google search

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,340
and I've searched from several different

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,840
locations so I've searched on my phone

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,600
I've searched on my laptop I searched

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,730
out of friend's house he's killing it at

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,040
SEO if you want to see a website in

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,130
action that's doing great things that

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,690
guy's got it going on

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,640
SiteGround has solid information they're

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,370
not just a wordpress marketing site they

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,520
really are sharing things of value so

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,890
they've got some good tips the Google

00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,660
rules for optimization and there's also

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,640
a Google style guide out there that

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,490
talks about how Google likes to see your

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:08,710
CSS how Google likes to see HTML all

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:10,930
good things to have and the Mozilla the

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,660
Mozilla list is kind of classic the

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,250
cheat sheets great the codex talks a

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,110
little bit about WordPress optimization

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,810
but what you're gonna want to do well

00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,730
what I find worthwhile from an

00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,370
efficiency perspective is just find the

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,530
right plugins to do the right job some

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:30,190
of this stuff I wouldn't want to try to

00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,630
code myself but WordPress does talk

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,870
about you know here's some things to

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,540
consider all right that's the end of my

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:42,730
slides we've questions comments concerns

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:46,510
go ahead microformats and rich data are

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:48,750
a whole separate subject are using

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,750
schema.org

00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:06,090
here's the thing I really don't like

00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:08,669
microformats because I feel like Google

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,080
is stealing people's attention so there

00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,210
are a ton of searches I do nowadays

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,700
where I'm like what does this word mean

00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,860
and the definition is right at the top

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,309
of the Google search results some

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,019
website went through the effort of

00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:24,299
defining that creating a website hosting

00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,009
it and Google is now scanning that there

00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,539
and hosting in there so I'm kind of

00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:31,679
against micro formats because I feel

00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:32,999
like Google is becoming I don't know I

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,960
don't know what you call that but I

00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,159
don't like what they're doing there

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,799
where they're stealing focus from a

00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,419
website I don't think that's great but

00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,830
as far as bonus points go yeah you do

00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:43,049
get bonus points for using right before

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,389
it's definitely right I know they do it

00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:48,539
with movie-theater times they've got

00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:51,869
sales buttons for tickets now yep

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:56,190
ratings definitely want your ratings the

00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:58,919
social graph rates all of your like your

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,720
interactions so like I know that most

00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,580
vlogs don't get a ton of shares they

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,779
don't get a ton of Twitter mentions but

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,610
having the buttons and having the

00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:10,320
metrics there it's a little bonus right

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:15,919
because it shows interactivity any other

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,919
questions yes yes

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:29,120
I'm still seeing a lot of websites do an

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:31,400
author blurb at the bottom and then that

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,700
author blurb links to your social media

00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,730
to prove that you exist these you gotta

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,410
prove you're a real person yeah yeah

00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,970
from from your bio to your social media

00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,320
or directly to your social media right

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:48,380
because an active presence on social

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:50,030
media gets you the the credibility yeah

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,550
you could do that I would do it to a bio

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,320
and then like a web out to all your

00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,010
social media I have tons of social media

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,020
so that's me

00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,270
you definitely want to link to a Google+

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,310
if you're not using Google+ like just do

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:04,040
it it's a chore but like it's bonus

00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:06,830
points with Google so go for it if you

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,250
want to get rated or sorry not rated if

00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,690
you want to get your sitemap there's a

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,400
word for that and I'm listening missing

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,200
it when they go through and they crawl

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,310
your site crawl that's the word so when

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,420
they go through and crawl your site if

00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,010
you're not getting the results you want

00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,930
fast enough like they're not updating

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:24,080
their crawl index you want to post to

00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,430
post to Twitter or post to Reddit you

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,010
know when I was in college reddit would

00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,900
get you indexed within 24 hours Twitter

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,370
probably gets you indexed a lot faster

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,810
if you get a little engagement going on

00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:38,660
