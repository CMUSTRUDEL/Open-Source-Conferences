Title: Alessandro Canepa: Using WordPress in a large business
Publication date: 2019-05-09
Playlist: WordCamp Rome 2018
Description: 
	When a large business decides to adopt WordPress as its main web platform, finding how to master, scale and optimize WordPress to support large traffic spikes becomes the challenge.
In this talk I will share the problems encountered, solutions devised and results of two years of successful employment of WordPress to run the website of a mobile operator.

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:14,880
okay so um I'll be talking about things

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,850
that maybe in in specifics there's gonna

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,400
be people that know better the details

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,910
but one thing I have the privilege of

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,890
having is a view an open view on what

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,160
happens when a large company embraces

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:33,329
WordPress and and the the aspects that

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,140
that overall impact the business so

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,140
about me

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,050
I was very introduced so I can actually

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:43,620
skip it what one thing is that my

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,410
colleagues say I'm I'm actually a fusion

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,680
of a marketer of an IT because I have a

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,300
past experience as a IT and also as a

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,940
designer because that's the job I do

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,350
usually on Fridays because we don't we

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,629
still have don't don't have a designer

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:04,519
in in my in my company and I have to

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:09,720
design my own stuff and so in November

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:12,479
2016 I was asked to to start working on

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,750
this project launch of a low-cost mobile

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,360
operator and they gave us one month time

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,720
to go live and it wasn't much and so we

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,240
we just chose to did speed start on a

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,390
series of things so first thing you know

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,930
use what you know we had competence on

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,630
the lamp stack so something based on PHP

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,040
WordPress and WooCommerce on top of it

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,979
and you know a classic operators website

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,350
is made by a home page where you should

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,350
show your products showcase the

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,100
e-commerce where you purchase it and

00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,189
recharge of the credit because

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,280
especially here in the lead it's typical

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,090
to have rechargeable sins and the custom

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,590
area where you manage your your

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:06,750
subscription so we adopted this approach

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,610
first do it because we had very little

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,209
time and then do it better which is

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,700
actually a quote from Osmani from Google

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:18,400
and so why WordPress well first of all

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,120
we had a very low budget and it's free

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,150
it was quick to deploy PHP based we had

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,269
competence to handle it

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,030
we bought a professional template and we

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,980
speed started thanks to that which is a

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,930
really really good choice in the short

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,920
term really bad choice in the long term

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,480
of course we needed a CMS because they

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,849
had people doing different jobs so you

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,879
can't have you have to have a

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,920
distributed way of updating content and

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,560
in WordPress is proven I was using

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,290
WordPress for more than 10 years so I I

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,390
knew it pretty well and so you know we

00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:00,879
were confident we could do the job on

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:04,000
this platform so in the digital life

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:08,019
cycle we adopt some tools and maybe this

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,299
is useful too to see like when we we

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:14,260
develop and we keep our repository on an

00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:16,930
instance of gate lab to do our tests we

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:21,250
automated most of our tests in Catalan

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,739
studio which is a free product we're

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,040
using to do testing automated testing

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:30,910
and we also use a Catalan plug-in which

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,120
allows you to record interactions on the

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,910
website and export them even in in

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,790
Python so we have scripts that run and

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:44,379
test functionality of the website to

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,599
warn us if the things goes wrong and to

00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:48,519
deploy and measure things we have as a

00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,489
monitoring tool for example we use

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,040
Pingdom we use of course Google

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:57,010
Analytics because that's in and that's

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,470
very useful use Cabana to analyze logs

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,650
and do end-to-end monitoring of our

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,620
processes so if you buy a sim on the

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,480
website until it is delivered we here we

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,389
have all the system it crosses and then

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,040
see if there's a problem of something in

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:14,459
the middle that breaks and it's not

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,310
working

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,320
we're working we're starting to work on

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,770
kubernetes we haven't employed it yet we

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,110
would really like to and for design we

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,940
well we use various tools but as I told

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,380
you we had we

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,990
are gone obadah as a template so from

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,290
monitoring well first of all we can

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:41,130
monitor website performances and through

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,830
the reports of our CDN provider a large

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,540
company like ours needs a CDN as one of

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,380
the things you can't can't do without

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:52,260
and it is very useful because you can

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,630
see the traffic on the outside and you

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,020
can see what are the hits on internally

00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,330
a CDN offloads more or less 80% of your

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,390
traffic so that means you have to handle

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,080
a smaller amount of traffic and and it

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:09,120
also protects you from attacks we

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,770
monitor our API calls this is a

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,210
screenshot from Cabana so these are our

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,520
api's numbers of requests numbers of

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,040
failed requests we can we can check if

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,230
the failed requests grow high mainly

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,230
there just because people inputted wrong

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,410
data like they try to recharge a number

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,420
which is not valid which happens but

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,640
still the API gives an error and we

00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:36,060
monitor it

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,520
of course we monitor at the uptime and

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,660
you also and you also have to monitor

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,610
PageSpeed PageSpeed page weight is very

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,890
very important it determines you know

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,590
experience but it also determines the

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,780
load you have on on the CDN which you

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,150
pay for bandwidth so that's money and

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,660
also on the load you get on your servers

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,640
so it's very important to do some you

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,470
know housecleaning every now and then

00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,610
keep sizes vary as as small as possible

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,230
plus you know you have to monitor all

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,620
the rest so I was as I was telling you

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:14,190
we monitor purchases recharges are the

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,480
same customer area activities we do

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,690
quite a lot of monitoring in our

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,090
customer area because and also in the in

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,540
the purchase process process because if

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:27,419
you see there's phases in which the

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,640
customer is slow you can actually

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:34,290
optimize the experience and and improve

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,530
it of course yeah we also have a series

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,940
of scripts that do monitoring of

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:43,890
coherence of

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:46,770
the information our REST API respond for

00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:50,400
example we have a REST API for our app

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,200
and and since there's a information like

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,180
the number of minutes of an offer and

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,150
things like that we checked that it's

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,530
coherent because could be the editor

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,230
who's entered that product has made a

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,850
mistake and has put the wrong number of

00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,900
minutes on it and so you see different

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:09,120
minutes on the app respect to the site

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:14,580
of course we use a Google search console

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:18,600
to optimize our SEO presence and we we

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,840
send alerts a lot we use slack we have

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,660
web web hooks for practically all the

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,660
monitoring stuff ends up in a dedicated

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,790
slack account sometimes email sometimes

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,570
telegram reviews also telegram first on

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:36,090
some of the things so the web

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,560
architecture just to summarize it in our

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:42,390
case we have a CDN provider it is Akamai

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,450
we have of course a firewall we have a

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:50,340
load balancer cluster which in this case

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:54,840
is f5 and currently we have 12 front

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:58,620
ends depends on on your context in our

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,080
case it was a matched in the blades that

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,550
were underneath so we have we have all

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,440
the front ends on different blades and

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,500
we have a dedicated server where we

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,450
reuse the PHP admin so you don't see it

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,040
from the outside it's just one of the

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,160
parallel instances but we from the

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,360
inside can access to pH to the

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,970
administration administration functions

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,900
and otherwise from the outside you don't

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:28,410
my sequel cluster we have to read only

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,390
and one read right and behind that for

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:34,650
authentication we didn't use LDAP and

00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,900
all our API services for the app we have

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,120
a dedicated infrastructure we started

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,940
out that we were sharing infrastructure

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,870
with web and app but the numbers of app

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,690
went really high

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,510
and so it was creating problems so we

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,010
decided to divide when you know you

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,800
divide and conquer is always a good

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,480
philosophy so if you divide things you

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,160
have less interactions and you can

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,509
manage things better

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,730
the app is uses a REST API to acquire

00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:04,489
content to dude you can now also

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:11,699
purchase services through the app

00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:12,959
through the REST API so this is a the

00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,119
part I hope you you're more sensitive

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,189
what are the lessons we learned because

00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:20,100
in two years you know you have you learn

00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:22,379
few lessons so first of all it's you

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,779
know you have to offload offload all you

00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,970
can and so it's important to have a CDN

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,100
and it's important to have a cache flag

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,160
plug-in those are two things you have to

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,850
have otherwise you know if you just put

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,029
a plain WordPress instance online even

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:42,089
if you have 12 servers and it just will

00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:46,350
crash as soon as you have you know 400

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:49,399
concurrent sessions and it'll suffer a

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:53,579
lot if you have a cache you have less

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:57,029
requests my sequel database and so it's

00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:59,069
performance go way up the CDN as I was

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,139
telling you before uploads more or less

00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:04,589
80 percent of the traffic so that that's

00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,709
also very important and the CDN has also

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:10,230
a great impact on user experience

00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:13,350
because we've tested we've used

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,480
different CD ends currently we're using

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,059
Akamai and the great thing about a

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,799
Akamai is that they have a lot of

00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,559
servers distributed across

00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:25,429
geographically they have servers in in

00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:29,100
all the web forms of mobile operators

00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:31,290
ice peas and so on so the perceived

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,689
performance of the website is really

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:37,139
good because you have your server right

00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:41,879
there right and and the other thing they

00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:48,179
also do is they deliver an HTTP to so on

00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:50,069
mobile it's also very very fast after

00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,899
you upload you have to distribute the

00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:56,639
remaining load so you have more front

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:59,939
end servers and you can choose to have a

00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,679
few very powerful servers or many less

00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:04,230
powerful it depends on the

00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,029
infrastructure you have already we

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,480
decided to distribute them on more

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,519
servers

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,380
because we had more blades so they know

00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:15,029
they're not physically on the same

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,529
hardware and then of course you have to

00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:19,199
have a hardware load balancer to

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:22,949
distribute traffic well across those

00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:26,070
servers and in my sequels cluster as

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:29,040
useful and hyper DB is very very good

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:32,370
to access tables in on the read only

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,760
instances and on the read/write so you

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:39,180
actually distribute the load of the my

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,329
sequel cluster also I think also

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,940
WordPress uses a hyper DB for their main

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:49,889
website and it I think it's a really

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,810
good product so maintenance you must

00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:54,380
consider your database like it like a

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,750
garden and so you have to keep it clean

00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,300
because it it tends to fill in with

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:04,560
stuff I we have just monitoring of how

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:07,680
tables grow and strange things happen

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:13,110
you update a plugin in a table just goes

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:15,120
bonkers the the it grows really quick so

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,050
you don't have to let it over grow so we

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,060
we did a few things like since

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,149
WooCommerce puts all your purchases

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,000
inside the gup-e posts table Whoopie

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:31,220
post meta and so on we have a process

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,779
which acquires the order and deletes it

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,149
so no we don't keep them keep their

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:39,060
orders on the WordPress instance they're

00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:42,630
imported on a different platform so that

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,699
allows us to have Whoopie posts and

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,139
Whoopie post made us really small tables

00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,910
and they're much more performant and in

00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,339
the beginning we didn't do that and and

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,949
the performance was just going always

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,920
slower every day because you know you

00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:58,949
can maybe acquire maybe 500 1000

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,709
customers a day and and you know cost me

00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:03,839
meta has many records for each order and

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:06,149
that's a lot of stuff so they grow

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,550
really quick have to be very careful

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,170
with plugins you before using them you

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,110
have to also stress test them and see

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:16,410
the performance you have to also verify

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,800
their impact on DB like we using Yost

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,619
and and it was creating

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,649
a lot of Records on the database for

00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:29,189
each order which actually don't need to

00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:31,679
be optimized for SEO so because they

00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:34,139
could consider that other as any other

00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,119
content and so was creating the records

00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,970
to optimize SEO of the orders but of

00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:40,769
course it's not important so well our

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,509
choice was to keep the orders right away

00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:46,290
from the platform directly so that that

00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:47,970
solved the problem beforehand keep

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,429
things updated so you have to update

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:53,040
your software stack and it's a high

00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:55,889
priority when it's a benefit last year I

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,799
was here and I listened to a few talks I

00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:03,480
heard about the performance of H PHP

00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:05,850
said 7.2 and we tested it in our labs

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,439
and I was for 4 times more performant

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,540
with with the previous versions we had

00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:12,540
and so you know 4 times is a lot that

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:15,779
means you four times the hardware

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,420
capability you had before and and of

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:22,739
course you have to update WordPress and

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:25,049
plugins so and also there's there's

00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:29,699
always space to to improve you know for

00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:33,269
improvement so like everything single

00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:36,240
thing can be improved so CDN what we

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:39,420
always do is take a look at the stats

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,910
and find out if there's any pages which

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:47,759
are have load off load percentages and

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:50,309
and we work with a provider to have it

00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:55,079
cached more aggressively because in many

00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:58,889
cases it can be cached and it helps it

00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:01,589
keeps that that 80% maybe you can bring

00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:05,129
it to 85 or something it's always that

00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,089
stuff web server we've evaluated working

00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:10,259
on nginx

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:13,379
on apache we've we've also tried using

00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:16,230
nginx as a reverse proxy currently we're

00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:19,110
using directly Apache because it

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:23,309
actually is less complicated for a

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:26,279
series of technical issues and since the

00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:28,799
rest of the infrastructure is handling

00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,259
traffic so well we mean we don't have

00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,850
this urgency but in case we need three

00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,570
we could move to nginx which which is

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,380
quicker

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:39,750
but less versatile and then Apache as if

00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:43,050
far as the database we're using my

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,410
sequel but we could consider also moving

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,750
to MariaDB it's more performant in our

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:53,760
case it it's not good but maybe in other

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:58,170
context it can help of course PHP as I

00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:01,440
told you is now 77.2 was a big

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:04,500
improvement and also even one could try

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,980
using HH BM which is developed by by

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:11,040
Facebook in our case we tried it it

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,650
didn't actually improve performances too

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:19,500
much it was more or less the same as a

00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:21,090
PHP 7.2 so we stuck with a 72 software

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,880
you know as I was telling you you you

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:26,400
you you can also improve maybe if you

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,750
find a caching plug-in that's work that

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,880
works better that can help you know if

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,490
it's better than the one you're using

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,820
now because sometimes caching plugins

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:41,100
have a few problems and you have to be

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,380
careful with them also you have to be

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:48,590
very very careful with the configuration

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:52,890
like one time colleague of mine changed

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:54,990
an option in the store locator and all

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,780
the platform crashed crashed completely

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,390
because it changed the approach the

00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,910
currently the the store locator searches

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,290
after you enter the page because it asks

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,470
you to get localized and then it

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,970
searches it was searching beforehand so

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,350
as soon as you went to the pages search

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,030
once and then it searched the second

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,980
time after Jo localized you

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,520
so it was doubling the number of

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:20,610
searches and the first time it didn't

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,180
know exactly where you were so it

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:27,209
actually had us you know in put us in a

00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:30,620
difficult situation and it took us some

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,620
time to find out what was going wrong

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,730
also one thing we we have to do we

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,250
haven't done it yet is to build a custom

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:42,030
high performance theme because

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:45,090
commercial themes are actually as light

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,210
as you could could want and you need to

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,940
do one and

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,460
we can't an embracing Guttenberg as soon

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,399
as it's more mature we've been trying it

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,840
a bit we need a few more features in it

00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:59,980
and I think they're really coming into

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:05,110
Guttenberg so I'm I think it could it is

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:07,659
the correct approach so uh from my

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:13,059
favorite book so long and sang thanks

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:17,870

ferret anticorrelated Antigua Bailey so

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,100
he was asking if the choice of WordPress

00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:32,530
was who took the choice to use WordPress

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,660
and because in some companies you know

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,790
not not every not many companies are

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,820
willing to choose WordPress because it's

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:42,550
may be considered too basic as a

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:45,309
platform and so I just it was it was my

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,260
choice at the time and RIT was very

00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,730
happy to have marketing take choice for

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,610
the platform probably would be my fault

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,920
and not theirs

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,320
okay well I guess we're going to lunch

00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,900
then thank you everyone

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:06,940
[Applause]

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:06,940
