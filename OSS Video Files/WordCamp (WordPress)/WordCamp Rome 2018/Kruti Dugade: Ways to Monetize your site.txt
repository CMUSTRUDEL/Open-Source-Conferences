[Music]

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:14,730
in a day approximately I talked to 35 to

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,820
40 users which in a week is I guess 180

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,980
to 200 and in a month that sums up to

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,529
700 requests and until now with

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,699
automatic I've dealt with 5000 requests

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:35,100
so far and one request that keeps on

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:38,160
repeating is one request that keeps on

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,370
repeating is how do I earn more revenue

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,100
how do i monetize my site I want to earn

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,050
money from it which is why I thought

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:52,500
it's nice to talk about it and I'm here

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:55,890
to share my thoughts on that so I want

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,840
everyone to look at this picture I come

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,379
from India a country who is obsessed

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,439
with cricket so I picked this example

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,659
for some of you who don't know he's

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,720
ex-captain of Indian cricket team MS

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,640
Dhoni now I want you to focus on this

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,640
image and notice that he has a lot of

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:24,500
company logos on his t-shirt and on his

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:27,750
bat now I want now I want to ask you all

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,270
why he has so many stickers and not me

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,180
what I have is just mu commerce that is

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,920
a product of my company but he

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,259
definitely doesn't work for a selfie

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,170
that doesn't work for girls but he still

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,270
has all of them can can anyone tell me

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,159
why why there's the difference why I

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,270
don't have those stickers but he does

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,479
why he's so lucky sorry

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:54,780
yeah exactly he's famous he has more

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,450
friends when I do my day job no one is

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,850
looking at me wishing he does his day

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,820
job when he is playing he has millions

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,780
of people looking at him and that is why

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,270
advertisers companies are interested in

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,090
showing their logo on his t-shirt

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,530
because indirectly they you are not

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,480
viewing him but

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,980
are also being else'll and that is why

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,970
we are talking about it we're talking

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,910
about that said we are talking about

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:24,300
Gulf we talked about others and it's not

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:28,800
just his t-shirt but his pants that has

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:31,950
vgn on it his bat has logos on it he'll

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,290
sleep both the sleeves has different

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,590
logos on it so two on this side two on

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,390
the other side so there's a lot of

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,910
advertisement that is done when he's he

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:50,810
plays and it is just because he's famous

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:54,330
he has fans and that is why so

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,940
advertisements on good revenue and this

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,680
is said over and over again but I'm

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,019
going to tell you you're not going to

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,319
earn good revenue of advertisements if

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,750
you don't have enough traffic so you

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,690
need good traffic on your site you need

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,959
more viewers on your site if you have to

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,209
earn revenue out of it another point

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,480
that comes in advertisement is having

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:22,019
relevant ads on your site if you're if

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,450
your blog is about food and your ads are

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,470
about fashion fashion cosmetics it

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,780
doesn't really make sense

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,260
so having relevant ads on your site is

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:36,480
very important next point is at

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,030
placement so yeah so where can you place

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,670
your ads it's very important first thing

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,180
you can paste in the header at the top

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,780
of your site then you have sidebar where

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,690
you can place your ads you have content

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,600
area now in content area there are two

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,040
ways you can add you can add

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,290
advertisements within your content and

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,109
you can add advertisements at the bottom

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,820
of your pattern I'll come back to this

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:06,390
and again you can add in the footer area

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:09,510
and the last way is you have pop-up

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,720
advertisements which is something that

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,450
you should never ever have because it's

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,430
very off-putting when someone visits

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,680
your site and is interested in your

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,250
content and you bombard them with

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,310
advertisements they are not here for

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,870
advertisements and in a process of

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,240
burning good revenue you might end up

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,039
losing that viewer

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,440
now talking about the content area I

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,860
would really recommend having

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,970
advertisements at the bottom because as

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,130
a user I really lose my focus when I'm

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,110
reading your content and in this Center

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,270
I have advertisement so it breaks my

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,259
link so it is something I would suggest

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,090
but many people add ads in the center of

00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,460
the content as well and that is

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:57,660
perfectly fine it works for folks but I

00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,120
will personally say yeah

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,789
next thing is affiliate marketing so

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,509
basically I have some products that I

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:08,639
sell and I'll approach you please

00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:12,180
recommend my products on your site and

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,210
I'll give you some Commission or I may

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,880
give you some of mine for free that's

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,099
how it goes

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,979
now affiliate marketing I'll be coming

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:25,590
back to the same point if you have fans

00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,889
if you have good audience that you build

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:32,310
you will definite you have that

00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,560
privilege to recommend products like if

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,669
you add link then people are going to

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,449
buy that because you have said it on

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,889
similar grounds I'll talk about

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:46,320
sponsored post now sponsored posts are

00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:48,750
basically you get paid for writing that

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,009
specific post now there are three types

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:55,699
of it one is dedicated post so let's say

00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:59,969
for example I have a fashion blog and I

00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:01,440
am approached by a company that sells

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:03,960
cosmetics so I'm going to write a

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,469
dedicated post reviewing that the face

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,349
mask is good the foundation is good this

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:12,870
you should probably try it and viewers

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:17,370
are going to take my word for it now

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,949
second way is sliding in indirectly now

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:24,120
let's say I'm in Rome I roamed around

00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:25,919
and I write about it like oh I went to

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,219
these places and I was so tired I was

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,199
walking all day blah blah blah and at

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:33,599
the end of the day I came back to my

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,719
room and tried on this face mask that is

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:39,900
so soothing it it relaxes my skin and I

00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:43,620
feel so beautiful now he who have

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,080
slide in that that this facemask worked

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,290
for you so indirectly you've recommended

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,050
this product and third type of sponsored

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,600
posters just mentioning like you write

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,850
your post like you write any other and

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,650
then you just mentioned that this person

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,960
is sponsored by so-and-so company and we

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,660
are tank we are thankful for your

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,810
support and blah blah blah so that's it

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,810
these how sponsors work and again I'm

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:15,300
going to mention this that you will get

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:20,760
sponsors if you have good viewership now

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:24,060
next is selling products now if let's

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,919
say you're writing long blogs like wait

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:32,370
but why you can also write ebooks and

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,080
selling those ebooks will on you good

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,410
revenue you're not really selling

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,220
anything physically so it's much easier

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:43,050
to write ebooks and sell them another

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,660
way of selling products is merchandise

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,720
which isn't very popular in bloggers

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,750
this is morally you will find in

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,600
youtubers doing that but I think it's a

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,260
good way if you have fans if you have

00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,639
audience then it is really nice way to

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,820
sell merchandise you can give it a try

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,070
like 50 units or pre-booking 450 units

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,560
and if it works works out for you if

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,620
people are interested why not but again

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,240
it's less it's much hassle than selling

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,220
ebooks because then you have to look for

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:21,240
shipping and all but it's a good way now

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:24,330
next is membership what if I'm not into

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,280
writing long term thing I I like writing

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,750
small post that is why we have so many

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,180
bloggers around so in that case and I

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,140
sell my content of course yes

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,330
if you content is if your content is

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,940
unique and if you're writing quality

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,270
content viewers will buy that content

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,240
because it's your turn and you can

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:51,240
always display like certain amount

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,580
certain short excerpts about what what

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,410
they will be buying or release for

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,350
one post about it and what next post

00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,730
will be so when you buy when users

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,700
purchase they know what they are

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,010
purchasing there are various plugins

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,980
that will help you restrict content

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,190
various Membership plugins and linking

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:16,110
it with products you can make users buy

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:19,020
it now I've read a few blogs which say

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:22,580
that your content should be premium

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:27,000
content and not available elsewhere so I

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,370
slightly disagree with this because if

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,220
you're let's say you're teaching writing

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:35,010
a blog about teaching something then

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,900
it's very hard to find a unique concept

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,640
like we have so many tutorials on

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,700
JavaScript we have so many tutorials on

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,770
wordpress but if users will buy it

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,470
they'll buy it for your content because

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,300
they like your teaching so it may not be

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,180
a premium content that's not available

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,810
elsewhere but it better be your content

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:59,880
and Nexis subscription so memberships

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:03,780
mostly work for long time like you you

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:09,060
take you buy my subscription for sorry

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:10,820
my membership for lifetime say 400 euros

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,040
and you have access to all my content

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:18,050
but what if I don't have 400 euros in

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:22,010
that case subscriptions work for you so

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,990
users pay a very small amount let's say

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:28,800
20 euros for a month for a short time on

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:31,770
your side you get repetitive income

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,080
every month so you have 20 euros coming

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,750
every month now you may say that I was

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,490
getting 400 and now I'm getting 20 but

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,470
if they use a kind of food that you were

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,570
in getting 400 at the very first place

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,590
so it works for both of us

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:50,610
and lastly donations it can be very

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:53,670
difficult to have sponsors at the start

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,940
so it is it is nice way to have

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,710
donations but button on your side to ask

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,080
for some donation and say hey you can

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,420
support me and you can be very creative

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,420
about it like hey buy me a beer or buy

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,120
me a coffee if you like

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,820
and having donations but it was very

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,300
important I feel now if you get

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,300
attraction from it you can also start

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,620
crowdfunding so Kickstarter or patreon

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:26,870
are really good sites that can help now

00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:30,650
all this sums up to people the focus of

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:33,670
this talk is basically people you don't

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:37,910
have to focus on money focus on people

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:42,490
because once you have audience that is

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:45,820
when you will gain more revenue from it

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:50,180
so let's talk about building audience

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:54,530
firstly content now when I say content I

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:57,290
want you to be very specific about it

00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,480
let's say I'm thinking to blog about

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,430
things I learned today and every day

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,080
I'll write about things I learned I

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,580
learned WordPress today tomorrow I

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,100
learned how to develop a simple plug-in

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,500
in it yeah then I learned how to develop

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,550
a theme and then the fourth day I

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,370
learned how to develop scrambled eggs

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:20,330
now that is not really necessary for the

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,950
users who are viewing my site they were

00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,560
interested in WordPress because my three

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:27,380
posts word about WordPress and now they

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,300
are about scrambled eggs so it is very

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,220
important that you focus on a niche and

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,260
write work on it secondly social meter

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,380
now content alone won't get your

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,810
audience if your users if your viewers

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,690
are not on your site then get that

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,330
content to your viewers so in this case

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,190
social media will help if your blog is

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,800
about photo then share it on Instagram

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,720
they shared it on Facebook

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,190
if you're writing long poles then maybe

00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:01,070
sharing an excerpt on Facebook or other

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:04,400
platforms like Twitter helps you and so

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:08,420
on and so forth so spreading your reach

00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:12,380
to spreading your reach is very

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:15,590
important third is consistency now if

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:19,250
your vocational about writing your

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:22,070
blocks you may not get those viewers

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,470
daily but if you consistent and you're

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,490
writing daily your viewers turn into

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,890
subscribers and that's how you build

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:37,370
active followers who follow you every

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:40,340
time foot point goes engagement now how

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,980
many of you I want to ask reply to the

00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,780
comments that you get on blog or the

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,180
comments that you get on your Instagram

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,060
account it is very important even if

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,790
it's a compliment hey I like the post

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,380
this is very informative it is very

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,940
important that you engage with your

00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:01,430
users with your view goats so say hey

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,380
thank you for liking my post I'm I

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,660
appreciate you giving your time for

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,610
reading it share on Facebook share with

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,070
your friends if you liked it so much so

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:14,330
indirectly you are asking them to share

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,710
more and now when they share you're not

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,540
just reaching out to your subscribers

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:21,800
but they are reaching out to more people

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:25,840
out there so that's how it is important

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:28,850
for you to engage lastly email is

00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,810
maintaining an email list is very

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:35,270
important because just say in case you

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,720
lose your site you lose access to your

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:41,360
site and you have nothing but you need

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,430
not have to start from grade 1 if you're

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,170
if you have a email list if you lose

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,600
access you can say hey hello I lose

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,460
access to my site but here's mine at the

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,590
site and I'm working on the same thing

00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,930
as before so you might subscribe me and

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,790
if they are active followers if they're

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,370
your fans they will definitely get back

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,140
to you on your new site so in this case

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,120
it is very important to have an email

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,760
list and there are various plugins out

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:09,440
there that you that will help you

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:13,880
maintain an email this so at the end I

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,310
would say that it will take time to

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,560
generate revenue it's not going to be

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,630
instant you you won't start a blog

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,390
tomorrow and start earning revenue so

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:27,320
focus on people and money will follow

00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,870
so that's Mother Church thank you for

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,500
listening

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:39,539
[Applause]

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:39,539
