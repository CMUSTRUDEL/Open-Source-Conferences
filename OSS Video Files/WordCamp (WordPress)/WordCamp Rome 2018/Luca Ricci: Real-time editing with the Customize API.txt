Publication date: 2019-05-09
Playlist: WordCamp Rome 2018
Description: 
	The Customizer was introduced with WordPress 3.4, nonetheless it is a very underestimated feature.
In this talk we will discover what it is and which tools we have at our disposal and how to extend its functionalities with Customize API.
At the end of the speech you will have all the information needed to start integrating it in your themes and plugins.

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,630
so first of all if you have a question

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,400
you don't want to wait at the end please

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:20,400
treat it with such like I would try to

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,760
get back to you so let's jump straight

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,830
into it before talking about the

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,320
customizer I want to have a look at what

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:35,040
we had before so before we had theme

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:39,930
options which were pages they used

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,460
sentence API to create like custom

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:48,960
solution for managing the configuration

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:55,410
and they could be like this is from 2011

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,780
theme or if you have built custom theme

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,109
options pages you might have come across

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,530
the relax very month which is a premise

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:08,880
framework that allows us to create more

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:14,790
advanced theme options and as we can see

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:20,400
here we have hundreds of options eaten

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:26,790
away kind of stops the menus we have

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:29,040
also a different CSS styling this takes

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:34,340
away the user from a crazy experience in

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:38,000
WordPress and it's really confusing so

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:42,930
some of these disadvantages of these

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,090
pages are the user all these user

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:51,360
interfaces settings are now up to date

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,380
updated in real time this means that the

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,860
user needed to change our settings save

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,509
them and constantly switch back and

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,170
forth between the front and back

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:09,479
tendency changes and this also means

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:13,370
that if someone was present site with we

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:17,769
were making those changes they would see

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:21,230
the exchanges - so this is not ideal and

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:25,099
some changes take my inner development

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,920
by days I mean that because it is for us

00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:31,010
it has made it easy for customers as

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,569
well to use the emotions and so they

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,970
might actually give up and call you and

00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:45,170
then take time away from you from

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:48,049
building pages so as a purpose three

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:52,480
point four which was back in June 2012

00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:55,790
18 we have a new site editing experience

00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:00,709
the customizer has been introduced to

00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,780
WordPress and so on it's the customizer

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,209
the customizer is basically our single

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,329
page application inside the workers so

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:12,680
and it's basically split into two

00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:15,799
different section on the Left we can see

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,440
the controls panel where or ceptin snips

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,440
and on the right we see the preview

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:28,730
website tweeting about the customer sees

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,980
then we can edit our website in real

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,389
time we can see what we're changing when

00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:37,099
we're changing it and also we don't need

00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,109
to switch that important to see these

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:43,639
changes apply this means that we don't

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:45,319
need to save them the end user won't see

00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,760
them until we're happy with them when we

00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:57,169
publish them so fantasies are as we said

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:59,810
we have the my preview is also actually

00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:04,090
the same and surprise feeling so you

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:07,099
might don't know what they're changing

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,769
but with the customize Utley actually

00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:13,609
see what they're changing him what that

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:15,739
change is affecting on the website so we

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,979
are we can drop shadow and publish

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:22,550
changes we have a consistent user

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:24,469
interface and user experience because we

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,150
can switch things and our users don't

00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:28,610
need to relearn how to

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,060
there are theme options to change the

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:35,000
configuration another cool thing is that

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,030
we can I necessary options and we will

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,300
see this later on a basically we can

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:46,220
show only what's relevant so we won't

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:50,330
have so too many times and the user will

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:54,440
not get confused and yeah basic

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:58,360
straightforward easy to connect they

00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,470
also make you do you know that they are

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,889
mandatory if you want to publish your

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:07,940
theme on worker support and personally I

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:10,340
think they'd so it's good for cleaning

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,160
in the developers as well because they

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,810
can use it as a selling point so they

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,070
can provide their users with the free

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:22,130
version we note the options and a page

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,970
and then say like you've got pro version

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:30,080
which gives you this testing experience

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:32,900
for anything your website okay so we've

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,520
seen what customizer is let's see how

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:40,520
it's made

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:44,300
so the customizer uses the program and

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,270
these allows us to make it more flexible

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,160
and extensible you don't need to be

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,280
familiar with object-oriented

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,840
programming to use it but obviously the

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,770
more you know the easier it will be for

00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:04,520
you to understand what's going on and

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:08,180
extended to fix so its components are

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:13,039
panels sections controls settings they

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:15,860
are each managed by the class and we

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,349
also have our class which is the

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,990
autonomy customize manager which is

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:26,139
basically a wrapper on top of all the

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,139
other components and allows us to easily

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:36,979
and as we can see here the customize

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:39,669
manager class gives us a few methods I

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,669
think

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,950
okay so the first component in settings

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,470
settings are basically the data that we

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:58,900
store in that bit and they are managed

00:06:53,470 --> 00:07:02,160
by photos and we can find that many

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:06,070
things that do because my setting class

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,880
so I would be either setting we hook

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:12,730
into the customers register action which

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,290
provides us with in with an instance of

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:18,850
that will be customized manager which

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,880
unsetting method we pass the setting

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,700
idea the first parameter and the second

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,860
one is an array of arguments these

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,850
arguments can be near the title which

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:35,790
should be in more option with different

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:39,540
shortly we have the capability so we can

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,360
restrict the access to our setting to

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:47,440
specific users the pin supports as well

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,680
that is basically tester customized to

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:55,150
show that setting only the current team

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,040
supports specific feature so for example

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,890
if your thing suppose the customary

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:06,880
feature and it customizable and customi

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:10,930
the section to allow you to tell me of

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:16,900
the default value for setting transport

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:20,500
method which is basically a way that the

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,360
customized which strategy to use to

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,290
update reading one her setting changes

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,820
and we also Nicole bit for validation

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,820
and sanitizing

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:38,469
so one thing to keep in mind is these

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:47,320
prefixes are certified cool so we can

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:49,300
use them and yeah as we said to setting

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,340
times one is teamwork

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:57,530
one is option D mode we use

00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:59,240
in notification API and these stores you

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,710
don't take time in so serialized already

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:07,040
as a single energy that would be

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:10,790
optional people save a dent in the WP

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,110
options table by two different ways yet

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,580
another are specific evening with

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:22,490
objects can be used with an team's own

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:25,040
planet and they are saved into there's a

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,230
typo in the slide but they are saved in

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,550
two separate answers

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:34,220
however the customizer allows us to pass

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,990
key on your beliefs for option as well

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:41,000
so they can be saved as a single engine

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:44,570
even to stick with those you can also

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,160
add your own times either by some

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:51,640
classic EWP customize setting parts or

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,970
more easily you can just pass a type

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,980
when you're registering your setting but

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,190
you should know that if you pass it on

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:05,390
time you need to end of the video and

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:09,920
the ante setting by yourself and workers

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:19,520
absence is two books for beginners where

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:23,300
the setting type of your setting so how

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,530
can we retrieve data basically it's the

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,020
same but we have to use two different

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:33,530
functions so it is in order to get the

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:38,000
mode function otherwise empty movie like

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:40,400
an option they both accept the idea of

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,870
our setting at the first parameter take

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,870
the default value for the second one

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,890
okay the next component

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,170
controls the America might be that

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,060
repeat as master class and they're

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,780
basically abusing the page for

00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,440
acceptance

00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:03,860
they must be associated with settings so

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,420
our editor and talks we use the app

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,310
control

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,710
Ethel we pass the setting ideas the

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,080
first parameter and the array of

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:15,400
arguments these arguments can read the

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,830
type which is basic nd html5 body it

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,950
could type the priority in which they

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:24,700
would be entering the customizer inside

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:28,680
of sanctioned mobility and the section

00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:33,790
which is required and intersection the

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:38,410
catawba long - it can be a coop section

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:41,110
or your own section labeled inscription

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,420
speaks for themselves and the choices

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,470
can be used with the radio type or the

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,090
selector we can pass a key value rate

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,880
where the key is the actual value that

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:55,680
we saw in the database and the value is

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,030
the data that's shown in the rock down

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:05,230
if you need to pass custom HTML

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:07,810
attributes the validation is something

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,760
years we did down wages time which is

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,890
basically our selling when we follow the

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,190
pages we are forming on the website and

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:20,050
if we set this one to two he will allows

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:28,300
us to create a new page from directly

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:36,720
from our two pages and then we have our

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:41,470
active call back which we can show

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:44,260
components only when the irrelevant okay

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:49,540
so yeah this is the time suspense you

00:12:44,260 --> 00:13:01,900
save a file you can also extend them

00:12:49,540 --> 00:13:04,570
call already provided us with field if

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,360
you don't have control the way to

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:11,410
register you is different so this time

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,020
we still use the control method but we

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,500
must be a new instance of the

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,900
follow the control class

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,570
which except the customized mandatories

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,370
the first parameter said to make is the

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,370
second one and I'm really a fabulous

00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:33,680
customer and this is how the bigger

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,680
Trenton

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,260
okay the next component of any sections

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,930
which are basically contains four

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:48,360
controls it doesn't affect my section

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:53,340
one thing to note is that they only

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:57,090
appear if there are tools related to it

00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,500
and we use the add section method we

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,180
pass the section is the first parameter

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,760
and the rating of arguments is the

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,270
second one again we forget from which

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,090
they will be shown in the control panel

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:13,230
finally if they belong to Japan we need

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:16,290
to specify the ID here cap ability teams

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:19,560
of both types of description as we've

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,720
already seen the time place think it's

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,550
only used by custom sections I've never

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,770
used it to be thick over again the

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,560
description it implies basically tells

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,650
the customers the - if set to true it

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:38,870
does the customer - I the section

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:45,690
description beyond our help item so

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:48,900
section last component is sponge and

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:55,470
they are containers for multiple

00:14:48,900 --> 00:15:03,450
sections functionalities for example did

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:06,620
not manage its discouraged by a menu to

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:15,450
use - to group different section

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:19,830
actually used to my section my thing so

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:23,339
I mean eponymous may be easier needs of

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:26,310
different from sections the changes of

00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,780
the many years

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,370
my lady

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:35,730
the array of arguments is pretty much

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:38,040
the same as me sections okay so we've

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:42,690
seen what estimator means how to extend

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:47,730
it and so now we we might expect that

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:50,100
everything would be like we have time

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:53,010
and when we change the settings it would

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:57,360
be instantaneous but this is about case

00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:01,410
this is because of transfer methods

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:05,900
which are basically a way to to tell the

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:09,360
customizer how to rearrange your changes

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,990
funny people they are set to refresh we

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:18,930
just name it just it's a full page

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:21,870
reload and this can be pretty slow as we

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:27,660
see here because we need to to reload

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:32,610
and change the setting it's not very

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:35,250
real time and also you might get away

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,970
with it reverse one side interested

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:43,860
speaker there would be more is lots of

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:47,790
experience with in slower so to overcome

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:51,660
this issue we reduce the post accent

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:54,180
method which is basically to enable

00:16:51,660 --> 00:17:00,900
enable communication between control

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:05,069
panel and you JavaScript and as we can

00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:11,069
see here when we change some title it's

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:13,230
very instantaneous then unlike the

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:16,860
refreshment of the recommendations tab

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,620
scroll to enable the post message

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:23,569
transfer method so in HD we need to set

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:26,339
obviously consume a flag to post message

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:28,370
then we need to use JavaScript and it's

00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:32,430
not nothing

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:35,340
this snippet which basically parents are

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:39,420
setting to our specific element on the

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:42,590
page so for example in this case when

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,390
blog name which is a site title changes

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:51,809
the element with the class of site title

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:54,270
we love the instance we also obviously

00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:57,150
need to queue our javascript file

00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,880
we used to customize video in it action

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,820
and we need to make sure that we pass it

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:09,890
as much quickly and jQuery scripts as

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:13,380
dependencies okay so this is great it's

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,929
real time assistant aeneas it's cool but

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,820
there's a caveat for most developers and

00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,190
the problem is that we post message we

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,429
need to duplicate our logic in

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,830
JavaScript and PHP this means that we

00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:31,220
are a little bit like Facebook don't

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:33,660
repeat yourself and bigger issue is that

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,780
let's say for example that your settings

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,809
and filter applied to me or your content

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:43,110
comes from a time period this kind of

00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:47,250
stuff are really difficult to preview to

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:52,620
see tax rate that's why as of purpose

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:55,049
4.5 a new framework is finished

00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:00,740
customizing this is in selective refresh

00:18:55,049 --> 00:19:06,360
memo which basically allows us to render

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:08,970
specific part of our site and so you

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,080
just need to know those just those parts

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:17,970
and not the deal your page and this is

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:24,210
done by agents so it just goes to fetch

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:26,730
the render PHP so the design we have

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:30,390
clean code base I think it's funny

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:33,330
principle for this more readable and on

00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,470
table we have a more accurate view

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:40,830
pretty good thing because as I said

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:43,110
sometimes we post message the result

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,990
that you see in the customizer is not

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,590
actually the result you would see on the

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,130
front end this is because as I said

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:56,200
you're setting my head of it

00:19:51,130 --> 00:20:01,350
party and yeah we cannot also associate

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,350
parts of the preview with the controls

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:08,320
so we can see it we have a little icon

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:12,809
next to a description we drink it we are

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,809
taken to the right section customize

00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:27,400
this is so it's it's also used by

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:30,850
widgets so before seeing that we have a

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,400
look how we register patient so we used

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,100
in our personal mental we pass this I

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,049
think is the first one no real arguments

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,570
at the second one it's except this

00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:48,370
selector which is basically the element

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:53,020
page we want the continuing into the

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:58,590
plug-in step two terminals we customize

00:20:53,020 --> 00:21:04,750
to refresh the old container content

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:18,309
differently Colbeck content and the pull

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:23,110
back refresh which is what we we just

00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:27,690
are compatible 94

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:30,929
you just enjoy support to your theme and

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,820
all Kobe tips we work out of the box

00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:38,020
however if you have a custom widgets you

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:40,090
will need to do you some first one is to

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,610
set the customize selective refresh

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:46,330
Wittelsbach to and you are constructing

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,490
your that would be with a plus and you

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,789
also need to make sure to in Hue your

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:54,549
streets unconditionally so the base

00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:57,460
don't need to grill of the customers

00:21:54,549 --> 00:22:00,000
don't need to reload the page to pass in

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,000
CSS changes

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:11,030
it's happy about it okay so that's more

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,430
that we can do to enhance the experience

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:18,590
of our users we can make us components

00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,870
intentional by this I mean that if we

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,600
have options that are dedicated to

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:27,710
specific pages we can show them how when

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,510
the user is previewing those pages or we

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:37,040
can create dependencies between those

00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:40,460
options so we can see these controls on

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:46,480
the home page if we switch to the power

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:49,670
base they will be eaten away the same

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,610
from the home page we are working from a

00:22:49,670 --> 00:23:01,940
section that's um I'm sorry

00:22:52,610 --> 00:23:04,340
and then we switch to the power page you

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,620
can use basic any comb function or your

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,679
custom function that's one thing to note

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,380
is the reactive power which the

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,840
customize manager distances the first

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,260
argument so for example if you're using

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:22,760
distance each page which accepting a jto

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:26,390
title as first argument you need to use

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,720
either an anonymous function or create

00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:34,840
your own

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:40,520
- another good thing that we can do is

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:46,640
validate settings so before more workers

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:50,900
4.6 we only sanitizing for section this

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:55,220
means that with sanitization we clean

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,780
the punished the input of the user just

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,400
before we are sending into third base

00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:07,070
and if something goes wrong it's not

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:11,170
notified so I might as well as 0.6 as I

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:18,610
said we have annotation in the violation

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:19,630
before setting to see if the input is

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:26,190
not funny

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:26,190
the request is rejected and I notice as

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:42,600
shown to the user to tell them so we

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,600
only accept integrals

00:24:44,790 --> 00:25:02,020
yeah oh yeah if only with less 1900 or

00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:09,430
greater than unity to new tool and we

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:18,550
publish so we know what we need to to

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:22,950
fix another thing I'm Ivan the one

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:26,350
covered is today yes I'm really produce

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:30,760
JavaScript API you can basically do what

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:34,720
you want for example you can dynamically

00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:39,370
show an eye controls based on setting

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:43,290
value slider and you have a flag to say

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:47,890
active when it's set to yes you can show

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:51,970
so for the image or the text like I said

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:54,070
- no just will be no way it's another

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,650
good thing that you can do is you can

00:25:54,070 --> 00:26:06,460
navigate to a URL and you click on

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:10,270
section or you can focus part so here is

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:13,270
the JavaScript API section in the

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:17,880
customizer handbook or if you want to

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:21,310
take it to the to the code go there and

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,770
this top is tomato which is basically

00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,890
develop

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:28,710
that's why he gave this talk before

00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:35,310
computers are serious we really go like

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:40,040
highly recommend you to watch it okay so

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:40,040
now I just want to show you a few

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:49,680
features customizable so one thing that

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:55,440
we can do is we can change the preview

00:26:49,680 --> 00:27:00,510
things either resulting so this from the

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:04,340
workers of all people we can start this

00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,340
in preview it

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:28,950
it's fine again here we can see if that

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:28,950
pain can stop anything

00:27:51,860 --> 00:28:05,600
feeling like can we just go back the

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:11,780
whole functionalities that we can review

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:18,950
a site on tablet smartphone is little

00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:22,550
life it's down here oh we can for

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:31,870
example create new pages directly from

00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:31,870
the customizer you want em a new page

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,280
and I know these are the stops so you

00:28:46,620 --> 00:29:00,030
will need to add the optional content

00:28:49,280 --> 00:29:02,600
later the good thing is the CSS section

00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:07,910
where you can basically have your CSS

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:12,809
this can be dangerous so I usually

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:14,850
disable it as and user don't need it but

00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:26,450
if you need is there and the cool thing

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:26,450
is that now he has almost complete

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:46,239
and it was a leader so he says I know

00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:48,419
property welcomed yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:53,200
that's because I worked it shall be the

00:29:48,419 --> 00:30:04,029
winter so tell us what's wrong we can

00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:08,919
change it so one thing that's been added

00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:13,919
on the purpose for 0.9 if the change set

00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:18,070
so we can now save my changes as drops

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:24,070
we can show you them the cool thing is a

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:29,519
weekly example sentence change we can

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,519
use the this URL to

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,669
to show our website with the actual

00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:43,529
changes so client this is good because

00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:46,860
for example if a client asked us to make

00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:47,970
change with students changes show them

00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,730
with this statement

00:30:47,970 --> 00:31:05,279
wait for them there are actually

00:30:50,730 --> 00:31:06,899
published we have the block feature so

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,519
for example if post you know that when

00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:15,889
someone's anything of course use you

00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,889
notice look at the post

00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:38,720
so here we have a few resources we need

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:42,860
to cite on Twitter custody

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:48,850
it's all so you might be wondering

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:55,760

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:58,490
useful thing they serve different if you

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,030
don't need if you up some things don't

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:06,700
need to affect the content itself in CPI

00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:06,700
the mothers always use the customizer

00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,059
[Applause]

00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:28,069
