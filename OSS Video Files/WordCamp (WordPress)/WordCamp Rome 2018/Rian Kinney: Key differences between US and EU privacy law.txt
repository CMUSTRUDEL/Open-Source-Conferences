Playlist: WordCamp Rome 2018
Description: 
	In response to the GDPR which became enforceable in May, the U.S. has opened privacy and data protection conversations at a state and federal level.
If you or your customers are marketing or selling to the U.S. you need to know key similarities and differences between U.S. and E.U. law to avoid legal liability.
This talk is presented by a U.S. business and privacy attorney and is for anyone working internationally, with the U.S. that wants to avoid costly business mistakes.

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,610
for me to be here food wine amazing

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,180
people

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,890
outstanding organizers amazing sponsors

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,140
thank you so much for putting this

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:27,750
together and allowing me to be here so

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,000
as she said I am a US privacy and

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,009
Technology lawyer I work with a lot of

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
the digital agencies that you know and

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,320
love I work with everyone from

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,950
freelancers to large companies handling

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:45,210
their tech issues such as trademark

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,980
copyright contracts and most recently

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,800
I've been working with companies on

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,469
privacy and gdpr

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,420
you all have been very familiar with it

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,210
for a long time because you've had two

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,500
years to kind of gear up and learn what

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,379
it was about before you started

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,830
implementing it and and doing privacy by

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,479
design the u.s. I don't know if we

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,020
thought that it just wouldn't apply to

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,659
us or we didn't need to get ready for it

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,780
but it really kind of hit the US as more

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,299
of a surprise even with the two-year

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,280
window of opportunity and we had

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,950
companies that were rushing to meet that

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,110
May 25th deadline and really companies

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,030
don't know even their in-house attorneys

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,229
don't have the background or experience

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,780
in privacy law to even know how to talk

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,880
about it intelligently or effectively so

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,500
being in this space right now finding

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,409
especially in the US an attorney that

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,820
knows about privacy law and can advise

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,799
on gdpr and EU law is very good to find

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,890
it's a really great business to be in

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,740
but similarly you've got we're starting

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,850
to legislate us privacy law and we're

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,799
going to make things very interesting

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:04,259
for you in return which is why I'm here

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,160
so I know you guys would be disappointed

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,450
if I didn't do my attorney disclaimer of

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,879
yes I'm an attorney but I'm not your

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,560
attorney so this will constitute

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,950
information for information

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,450
purposes only it is not legal advice so

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,730
now that we got that out of the way I

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,770
hope to have time at the end of the talk

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,270
to answer any of your questions and I

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,459
would love to have a discussion with you

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,010
later if you're out and about and you

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,709
have questions you can always email me I

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,290
love talking about privacy law everybody

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,480
says oh I'm a nerd we all have things

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,900
that we're super nerdy about and law is

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,790
my jam so please contact me if you have

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,190
any questions so in looking at

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,739
differences in in privacy law it's

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,450
important to understand kind of all of

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,910
it where it comes from the different

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,400
cultural approaches and legal approaches

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,980
because it affects how we not only

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,970
legislate the issue but how you all

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:07,860
design so in Europe you guys have

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,319
privacy as a fundamental right there

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,080
have been there's been a lot of

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:15,330
unfortunately religious persecution

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,780
inquisitions genocide war things that

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:22,560
have really value there's a value placed

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:26,269
on privacy and identifying information

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,709
such as your religion or your background

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,200
your information your fundamental right

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,290
belongs to you which is very different

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,120
from the US and you have an opt-in

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,170
culture where we tend to have more of an

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,060
opt-out you also tend to trust your

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,209
governments more and your companies less

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,290
where we tend to not trust companies and

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:51,450
the trust and distrust our government

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,790
and this is important because our

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:57,120
approach to valuing free speech and your

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,799
approach to valuing privacy means we

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,850
haven't done a lot to legislate or

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:08,069
protect privacy in the u.s. pretty much

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:11,250
at all and we're working on that so from

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,799
a legal approach the EU has come

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,810
together 28 different member states and

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,419
countries have all come together to

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,630
legislate one unifying body of law that

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:24,120
oversees everything and while you have

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,580
member states that can create some laws

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,540
that are slightly different where you

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,280
can change the a

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:35,010
of adulthood from you know 16 to 13 for

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,550
enforceability of GDP are the u.s. smart

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,360
functions very very differently and the

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,810
fact that we don't have an overarching

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,910
federal law across the u.s. it's really

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,370
done individually by the states at this

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,090
point which can create a lot of havoc

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,520
and make it very difficult to comply you

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,950
also tend to legislate and do things

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,140
through hard law meaning you have a gdpr

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,930
regulation you have an enforcement body

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,660
of people the DPA is that will actually

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,940
enforce it and come after it where a lot

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:13,080
of the legislation and laws in the US

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:16,410
are soft law their suggestions our FTC

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,450
has marketing guidelines where they're

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,170
not if they're not enforced they're

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:25,080
really not followed because in the u.s.

00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:31,830
we are looking at legal penalties rather

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:34,290
than a fundamental privacy right so

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:38,510
talking about again our our legal

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:41,550
approach right now in the US the real

00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,890
privacy law per se that we have in

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,990
effect at a federal level the only law

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,240
that I can think of is the child's

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,250
Online Privacy Protection Act that's

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,840
Coppa and that affects through the FTC

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,140
companies that market and target toward

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,210
children 13 years or under this law

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,390
actually talks about children's privacy

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,220
and what you need to do as far as

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,060
getting parental consent and things like

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:13,140
that other than Coppa at a federal level

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:16,020
we have laws that are specific to

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,260
industry very fragmented approach to

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,490
privacy law so we have HIPAA I don't

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,810
know if any of you are familiar with

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,130
that if you work in the health industry

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:28,590
so HIPAA has similarities with gdpr and

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,460
that they require business associate

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,920
agreements our health profession through

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,870
HIPAA is responsible for vetting their

00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,360
vendors and making sure that the people

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,580
that they do business with protect

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,480
privacy to the same level the

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,520
they're required to and we have the

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,669
Graham lychee act if any of you are in

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,620
the financial sector that also discusses

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:56,100
the information that can be collected

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,060
who it's able to be disclosed to and the

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,490
accessibility

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,990
those are two industries that's a lot of

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,400
Industry and a lot of people that are

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:12,360
not covered by privacy law in the u.s.

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:18,360
outside of you know health and health

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:21,570
and the financial aspect so as I said we

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,810
tend to legislate at a state level as

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,750
opposed to a federal level and I'm gonna

00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:33,050
talk to you today about California law

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:37,680
why California because California like

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:40,830
Germany and or Great Britain in and

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,840
Europe tends to lead as far as privacy

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:47,940
law is concerned so you can see the data

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,310
security breach Act was passed in

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,360
California in 2002 they were the first

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:57,479
to have a data breach law on the books

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,270
we just got all 50 states to have a data

00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:03,360
breach law in effect as of March of this

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:06,270
year so for 16 years

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,220
there were people citizens of the United

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,560
States in certain states that didn't

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,400
have the right to be notified if their

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,820
data was stolen or leaked or anything

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,270
like that and so a lot of the states

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,400
merely took California's law and passed

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,530
it through their own so we always look

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,060
to what California is doing to see what

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:34,110
the rest of the United States is going

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:37,169
to do also yet kalapa is the the premier

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,330
privacy law in the books before gdpr

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,940
came to into effect that's what we were

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,029
really going off of and it merely

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,450
requires the privacy policy that you

00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,520
have one that it's on your home page and

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,650
certain disclosures but it is nothing

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,930
like the comprehensive level that you

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,600
guys have taken into gdpr if you

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,060
comply with gdpr you're automatically

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,890
complying with Khal Appa because it's

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,440
you know kind of bare minimum did you

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,560
have a question okay I just want to make

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:12,990
sure okay um and also California is the

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:16,290
fifth largest economy globally so it's

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:19,110
not just within the United States it

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,470
functions with we have Amazon Google

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,839
Facebook Apple headquartered in

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,240
California so again this is where our

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,220
tech industry is located this is where

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,260
they have their lobbyists this is where

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,510
they're most active so again

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,130
California law is the one to look at if

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,080
you're doing business with the US and

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,500
you want to know what you need to be

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:43,380
complying with we're talking about the

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,630
California privacy law today again

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,510
number one because it's in California

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,480
and it's very important but number two

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,240
it's going to change and evolve over

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,550
time it's a it was passed in July it's

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,910
already gone through committee and had

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,430
some revisions and it doesn't

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,070
necessarily apply to everyone I've

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,050
included here who this applies to and

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,790
you can see it they're really targeting

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:14,070
larger companies global companies so

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,220
this might not have applied to every

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,620
everyone right now but we're also in the

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,020
u.s. now starting to talk about privacy

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,420
at a federal level maybe we should have

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,430
a unifying body of law that would make

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,720
it easier instead of having 50 different

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:32,430
states have individual laws so we're

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,230
looking at California to kind of shape

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:38,130
the direction of that conversation for

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,750
us so I kind of think that the even the

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,360
title of this law is somewhat misleading

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,459
because it's called the consumer Privacy

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,589
Act but to me it's really more of a

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:49,470
consumer protection act because it

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:52,050
focuses less on privacy again as a

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,420
fundamental right and the eeu and more

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,180
on trying to regulate what businesses

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,100
can do with the information after

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,040
they've collected it it's not focused

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,620
really on my rights as you know Ryan the

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,990
individual it's really what can they do

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,670
with my information as far as selling it

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:13,020
to third parties or resell

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:15,180
or not so you have the information as

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:20,220
far as who does it a who does it apply

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:25,800
to another major difference between EEO

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:28,560
and us is how its applied in EU everyone

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,480
and located within the EU is covered by

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,810
Gd P R regardless of whether they're a

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,450
resident or citizen in the u.s. it's

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:40,410
based on citizenship of the specific

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:43,020
state so in order for this law to apply

00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,480
you're looking at collecting information

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,950
of California residents which means you

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,070
have to know if they're located in

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,800
California you're doing business in the

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:56,340
state and one or more of the following

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,550
so again the good news is this law right

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,280
now as drafted is not overly applicable

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,960
to smaller businesses which a lot of

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,490
people were complaining about gdpr it's

00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:11,610
hard for smaller businesses to comply

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,830
one major difference between the two is

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:18,600
how we even classify what's being

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:22,560
collected with California we're calling

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,540
it information versus data and the

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,000
information that's being collected under

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,120
this law not only includes all of the

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,980
personal data collected under the gdpr

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,470
but also includes households how do you

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,260
define household it also includes

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,370
devices on the IOT or the internet of

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:47,450
things so this is including all of your

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,850
Alexa your Google homes anything that's

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,070
collecting statistics about you that's

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,510
now considered personal information or

00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:59,760
consumer information under this law and

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:02,670
when it's looking at identifying an

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,160
individual or a household even things as

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,940
basic as your annual water consumption

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,000
or your electric bill are considered

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:16,070
personal data and are are not allowed to

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,070
be resold under certain circumstances

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:25,050
penalties everyone loves this part

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,660
okay so I think everyone we all know

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,690
about the the penalties under GDP are we

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,520
all know about the percentage and and

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,340
the Euro and that reprimands and

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,300
everything like that so under California

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:41,760
this is a huge shift and change from the

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,640
way that the US has viewed privacy or

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,840
consumer protection in that they've now

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:52,770
included a private right action right

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:56,760
for an individual to sue you to sue the

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,950
company okay so it's always have we've

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,110
always had statutory provisions if you

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,270
break this law the Attorney General of

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,220
the state of California that's who would

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:09,210
regulate it or pursue the action can

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,430
find you under the law now if you breach

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,380
my data not only can the Attorney

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,130
General come after you and punish you

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:20,400
but I can sue you and get paid for you

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,500
for harm caused there's two ways for me

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,770
to get money from a business that has

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:30,810
breached my my data one is the statutory

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:34,320
minimum or maximum which is that hundred

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:37,860
hundred or seven hundred and fifty per

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,100
California it's per resident so if you

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,320
have thousands of people that have you

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:49,500
have a data breach each individual can

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:55,230
sue you for for these amounts if they're

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:57,660
what if ah if they're Texans right now

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,510
Texas doesn't have a law but please

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,970
understand so far we've had four states

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,260
already enact brand-new privacy laws I

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,790
believe it's a Vermont Colorado

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,470
California and I can't remember the

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,110
fourth one off the top of my head but

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,910
that's that's the problem right now we

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:18,060
have these individual states that are

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:21,120
saying our citizens are entitled to this

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,490
and even doing business as a US business

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,460
if I have to comply with 50 different

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,450
laws and 50 different residents having

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,300
all of these different rights it's

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,940
incredibly confusing even this even this

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,970
law as drafted conflicts with

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,410
California's own laws

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,390
so I mean that's they're in the process

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,630
of refining this and going through it

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:45,210
but it's overwhelming and the u.s. is

00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,670
more and more seeing that this way of

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,920
doing things is ineffective and it's

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,320
going to make things so difficult for

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,820
people outside of even the u.s. to do

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
business with us that it can hurt our

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,200
bottom line and this is a great thing I

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,690
think for all of us that the u.s. is

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,490
seeing that this is a problem but that's

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,170
also I mean we're kind of having more of

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,180
a discussion at this point then then the

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,620
presentation but again I mean this is

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,510
the conversation that we need to have

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,020
and that I want to be having with the

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:15,270
WordPress community but yeah so this is

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:19,590
in WordPress we have an inner ability to

00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:22,230
shape the the actual organization and

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,810
the tools that we use we have the

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,670
ability to change the way the laws are

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:30,210
drafted and to create communication

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,680
between our legislators I hope some of

00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:35,090
you had the opportunity to watch the

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,520
Facebook congressional hearings

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:41,940
hilarious I mean the questions that were

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,500
asked were embarrassing how does email

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,990
work these are the people that are

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,180
drafting our laws that don't even know

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,430
about technology or how it even

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,340
functions and if we as a technological

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,140
community aren't reaching out to them to

00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,300
say this is how it works and this is how

00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,090
it functions expect to get laws that

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,230
make no sense for you expect to get laws

00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,930
that are gonna put you out of business

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,000
or hurt your customers because you did

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,330
nothing to step up and help the

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,120
situation in the US we have now a tech

00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:15,120
tech Congress I've shared the the link

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,250
on my Twitter so my clients and friends

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,130
can can join that I don't know what you

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,930
have in Italy or specific countries and

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,380
and organizations that you're involved

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,970
with but step up have meetups be talking

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,740
about this and be talking to the people

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,550
that are making the laws and help them

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,500
understand so that's that's a just my

00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:37,850
little shtick and we can talk about that

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,920
more the other key difference between

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:45,090
the California law and gdpr is the

00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:48,000
30-day right to cure so the California

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,750
if you if you write the company and you

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,350
say you've breed

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,820
my information I'm gonna sue you if you

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:57,270
don't change it they have 30 days to

00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:02,010
change it if they do you're not entitled

00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:03,990
to statutory damages anymore

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,580
so you know that's that's a good thing

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,050
for businesses that are actually trying

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,810
to do the right thing now differences

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:13,370
between the actual individual rights

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:16,470
under GDP are and California

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:19,110
California's law is more interested in

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:22,230
categories of information it's a lot

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,970
less comprehensive as far as you know

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,620
the data that's being collected and what

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,530
the companies actually have to conform

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,120
to again California the law is looking

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,120
more at the sale of information and

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,440
resale of information so I have this

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,940
here the slides are going to be

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,410
available I don't expect you to read all

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,640
of this and again you can ask me

00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:47,910
questions but the other key difference

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:50,010
here is the portability California says

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,260
yes you have the the companies have to

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,900
provide the data information and a

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,640
portable format an electronic format but

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,220
they're not necessarily required to

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:06,090
forward that on to the next vendor right

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:09,510
to erasure when it applies is actually

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,480
different again you guys see I kind of

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:17,280
want to say you guys but the EU sees it

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,470
more as a fundamental right that applies

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,070
and really goes through the list of when

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,620
you have a right to erasure California

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,500
is taking this approach where they have

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:31,890
to erase it if I ask them to so it's a

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,690
lot less explained as far as they have

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,880
to erase it under certain circumstances

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,560
if I ask them to erase my information

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,400
because I don't want them reselling it

00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,350
they have to and there are again some

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,120
exceptions and the exceptions are

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,580
different so if you're you know looking

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,990
at gdpr versus California knowing these

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,990
exceptions is going to be incredibly

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,600
important but you know if it's for

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,860
security purposes making sure that you

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,540
don't get breached they're allowed to

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,330
keep my information to better protect

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,860
the system and other users Public

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,570
Interest certain things like

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:08,330
that want to make sure you get that

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:11,700
yen's

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,530
again the difference between EU and US

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,280
is right to opt in and right to opt out

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:21,510
right so with this law

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,280
it requires that companies provide us or

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,620
excuse me California citizens the right

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,920
to opt out because we're automatically

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,840
opted in and you must have a clear and

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,309
obvious link this is the type of thing

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,770
that you're looking at from a design

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,410
aspect you must have a link that says do

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,140
not sell my personal information it must

00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:43,860
say that specifically and it must link

00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,380
to my ability to opt out so that's

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,140
important of course I pair that with

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:53,190
your right to object the right to object

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,290
to processing different data and how its

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,270
defined another gdpr is very very

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,960
different than what we're looking at at

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,580
california again because California is

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,650
looking at the sale of information and

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:08,040
gdpr is so comprehensive as a privacy

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,980
right as a whole duration here's what I

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,410
found interesting is under California

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,500
must respect consumers decision to opt

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:19,440
out for at least 12 months before you

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,970
can ask me again so I know that you guys

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,830
are familiar with the e privacy

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,320
directive which will be the regulation

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,260
soon and yeah you're not allowed to ask

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,330
me 20 times whether I'm really serious

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,270
and I really didn't want you to sell the

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:36,150
information but the US were like yeah

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:38,070
you know twelve months okay were you

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:44,820
serious can I can I sell your

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:46,590
information so I did a summary of the

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,190
differences and and what the California

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:54,630
law entails but I want to tell you guys

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,400
the other major provision here which is

00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,100
groundbreaking not only do we now have a

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,559
the individual right to sue for for

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:05,610
breach of data we have a provision in

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:08,190
this law that says that anything that

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:12,360
tries to waive or limit a consumer's

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:15,600
rights is null and void which is our

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,809
arbitration and our class-action lawsuit

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,899
so we're before people could put in

00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:23,820
class action waivers and you would be

00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:25,409
not be allowed to have class action

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,039
suits they've done away with all of that

00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:31,529
so expect a lot of the larger companies

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,640
to not only be dealing with individual

00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:37,679
people that are suing but a lot of class

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,529
actions and this is going to be a huge

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,179
moneymaker and deterrent and so we have

00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:45,630
come up with some other kind of

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,279
legislation so the other aspect that I

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,640
didn't really touch on I just wanted to

00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:53,010
make you guys aware a toll-free phone

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,659
numbers if you're doing business in the

00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,399
state of California and you meet those

00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,320
requirements that I talked to you about

00:22:56,399 --> 00:23:01,260
earlier you're now required to have a

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,720
toll-free number and specific mechanisms

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,600
in place for California residents to

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,679
contact you and discuss the removal of

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,270
information and the specific rights so

00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,600
what happens now we've touched on this

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:18,029
throughout my talk the u.s. is talking

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,399
at a federal level about enacting

00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,620
privacy laws the Department of Justice

00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:25,320
has reached out to or allegedly reached

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,380
out to tech companies to open a

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,570
discussion the tech industry is very

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,760
concerned about what's going on we see

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,649
the congressional hearings but this is

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,330
something that we in the u.s. are

00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:39,179
talking about and it's something that

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,190
you guys need to be looking for privacy

00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,190
shield suspension I don't know if you

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,440
guys are aware of this but the u.s. was

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:50,130
told that they need to comply and make

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:55,289
certain changes under the privacy shield

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:57,990
by nine one there's no output as far as

00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:59,789
whether that actually happened and if

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,799
privacy shield is overturned that's

00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:03,990
going to be a huge issue internationally

00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,820
for everyone involved because that was

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,010
our cross for border transfer of

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,890
information and the way that a lot of

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,240
you US companies were doing business and

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,720
complying with gdpr

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,399
and cross-border transfers so that's

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,740
going they're going to be having I think

00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:22,740
their second or third annual meeting

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,510
later this month for privacy shield and

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,250
EU to determine what they're going to do

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:32,970
about the US you guys are welcome

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:35,190
and moving forward and again I don't

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:39,360
know if you are familiar with shrimps

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:41,070
but that was the the major litigation

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,980
that had to do with the contractual

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,169
clauses the mechanism for cross-border

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,919
transfers that were the pre-approved and

00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:52,919
binding corporate rules but that is now

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,230
being referred to the ECJ the the 2.0

00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:59,570
version to see if those contractual

00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:02,909
clauses are going to be upheld or not so

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:06,750
I've told you all you guys can get

00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:09,450
involved if you saw release four point

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,309
nine six and the export tools you guys

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,770
can think the core privacy team who

00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:17,700
worked tirelessly Leah post avoid and

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:20,520
Heather burns shout out they work

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,220
tirelessly to get this done and included

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,580
as well as the privacy policies but as

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,679
the laws change as technology changes we

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,809
need to start integrating certain tools

00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,570
into WordPress and you can be a part of

00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:35,429
that not only if you're a developer and

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,140
a design aspect you can contribute in

00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:39,270
that way if you're like me and you don't

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,549
have this particular set of skills

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:44,580
you can contribute your knowledge of the

00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:46,549
law and help proof privacy law but

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,150
there's a way that you can contribute to

00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:52,380
WordPress marketing core privacy

00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,539
accessibility just get involved as an

00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,030
amazing thing and here's the information

00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:59,010
for how to get involved on slack you can
