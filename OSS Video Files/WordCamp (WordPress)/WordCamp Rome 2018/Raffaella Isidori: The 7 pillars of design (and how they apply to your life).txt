Title: Raffaella Isidori: The 7 pillars of design (and how they apply to your life)
Publication date: 2019-05-10
Playlist: WordCamp Rome 2018
Description: 
	Gerarchia, Equilibrio, Spazio, Colore… ci sono principi che governano la progettazione che assicurano che il risultato sia di successo e di qualità. Questi stessi principi si possono estendersi nelle nostre vite quotidiane, per offrire l’opportunità di vite con più significato, e maggior qualità.
Questo talk esplora ed illustra questi principi del design (qualificandosi quindi come un talk sul design) e al contempo offre lo spazio per riflettere sull’importanza di progettare per noi stessi vite complete e dense di significato.

[Music]

00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:14,089
[Applause]

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:17,160
it always feels very funny to speak

00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:22,080
English to an Italian audience but it's

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:25,380
okay you know hi

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,900
it still feels strange but it's okay you

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,000
can you can all practice with me I

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,730
actually hate this it always makes me

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,469
get into like karaoke mode you know

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:41,190
anyway ciao roma that I can say that

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,710
with a perfect accent so before I start

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:48,809
I have to say this I'm gonna take 30

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:51,960
seconds to note and mention that last

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,110
year the first workcamp Roma was also my

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,969
first war camp as a speaker and so

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,879
working promo will always have a special

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,989
place in my heart also because it

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,960
started my quote/unquote career as a

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:12,150
speaker at work camps which I've been

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:15,689
doing a lot lately so grazie roma let's

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,990
get to it this is me this is what I do

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,850
which is a lot of stuff I actually do

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,110
all of this and I actually get paid

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:31,740
every once in a while to do it so my

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:35,490
topic today is about the seven basic

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,689
principles of design which you may or

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:45,030
may not know but also of how they can

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:47,250
also apply to our lives and this talk

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,530
was inspired by a book by Alex White

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,229
that is called the elements of graphic

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,229
design so let's get to it

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,460
the general principles that guide visual

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,820
graphic design can also relate to many

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,149
aspects of our lives and being aware and

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:10,530
mindful of them can help us design

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:13,200
better lives but before please a note of

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,170
warning these are not

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,060
rules these are principles which are

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:24,180
should be considered as guides not as

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:28,819
you know mandatory thank you and their

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:34,220
indication you can consider them as

00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:37,050
little dials like in the next picture

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,330
like sliding switches that you can turn

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,260
on and off switch something you know

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:46,500
more of something less of something to

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:51,780
have to achieve better more appealing

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:56,040
and value-added design and lives so

00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:00,180
let's go the first principle is space

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:04,890
and we can define space as the area

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:10,680
within around above or below an object

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:13,230
or objects it can be physical

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,860
that's three-dimensional that's the

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:20,569
space we occupy and you know that it's

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,400
filled with things or it can be visual

00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:29,340
intangible that's the space within in a

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:37,620
layout Apryl agreement fills our space

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:41,160
up a lot full R and leaves it empty it's

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,549
also the area at our disposal for the

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,579
tasks we are working on so that could be

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,829
the final print size of a project it

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:53,370
could be the screen of the computer or

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:57,389
it could be the mobile device that we

00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:00,299
design for in life space is what

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:05,150
surrounds us physically spiritually and

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:10,139
mentally in design white space is

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:13,230
especially important white space is the

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:17,700
space between the elements as well as

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:22,800
the space within the elements it's not

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:26,039
empty space consider it like the pause

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,900
that when listening allows you to

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,699
understand

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:35,600
words or let me show you something

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:41,539
hard to read right okay

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:46,130
so white space is not no space is white

00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:49,850
space it's a very powerful element of

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:55,220
design and it can enable some object to

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:57,979
exist that actually don't exist the

00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:03,530
arrow in Federal Express is white space

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:11,150
and the pandas head and body in you know

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:15,470
the three WS is white space in life

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:19,370
white space is that quiet time it's a

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:25,070
time to rest and recharge it can be

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:29,690
physical like sleep it can be vacation

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:33,650
time away from work or people in my case

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:36,849
as an introvert I always need time alone

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:40,310
after being with people

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:45,409
it can also be mental through meditation

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:48,919
and running and simply unplugging we can

00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:54,139
create white space that can make us

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:57,169
breathe better we need white space in

00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:00,050
life to see better and feel and

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:03,710
appreciate the things that are fill our

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,990
lives just like in that words all

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:09,740
attached together if everything is

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:14,630
attached together it gets hard to get it

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:19,310
and appreciate it and the same is in

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:21,320
design space the second principle I want

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,889
to talk to you about is that of unity

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,720
and harmony in a design when all

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:30,560
elements are in harmony

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:36,710
no individual part is perceived as more

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:40,580
important than the whole like here we

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:47,509
see in a we see a picture we don't see

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:49,819
stone amongst other stones achieving

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:54,050
harmony is a main goal of good design

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:56,840
and just like in a design space when all

00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:01,419
elements in our lives are in harmony our

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:05,180
quality of life is superior and better

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:08,389
so to avoid chaotic or boring and

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,699
lifeless which is the opposite design we

00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:15,199
need a good balance between unity and

00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:17,240
variety and to avoid boredom we need a

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,050
good balance between the known and the

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:26,090
new and the safe and the exciting in our

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:29,919
lives we achieve unity in design in four

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,960
ways the first principle is proximity

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:36,349
that's elements that are physically

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,080
close are seen as related you see here

00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:42,110
this that's the same exact elements the

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,009
same number of squares but in the first

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:48,380
case it's a square made of squares and

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:52,610
in the other case it's just squares

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:56,650
scattered around when objects are placed

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,650
together they're perceived as group

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:10,430
proximity in life is community it

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:12,620
satisfies our need for belonging the

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,340
second way we can do it is through

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,279
similarity elements that share similar

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:22,909
positions size color shape or texture

00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:27,710
are seen as related to form a group or a

00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:30,770
pattern similarity in our lives

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:34,039
makes us feel safe and belonging like

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,680
here now okay we are amongst people we

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,669
know and we feel close to and we fit in

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,240
we feel safe but it can also make us

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:47,720
curious or suspicious about the

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,970
unfamiliar and unknown so it's you know

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,689
something that can be good but if it's

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,329
too much it can be bad

00:08:52,689 --> 00:09:00,439
the third way is through repetition and

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:03,459
rhythm recurring position size color or

00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:07,339
use of graphic elements create unity

00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:13,910
rhythm is repetition with a focal point

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:16,360
a focal point interruption in life this

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:19,910
translates into having routines and

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,180
breaking those routines in appreciating

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,420
comfort and breaking out of our comfort

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,670
zones

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:32,529
the fourth way we can achieve unity is

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,529
by using variations on a theme

00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:42,709
variations provide continuity but they

00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:45,949
retain interest and in life well we all

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:50,600
like pasta but not with the same sauce

00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:55,910
every day right the next principle is

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,370
Gestalt Pregnant's which is the

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,220
principle of psychological principles

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:05,410
underneath it is the german word for

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:09,769
penis which means concise and meaningful

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,680
it states that humans tend to order

00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:16,819
their experience in a matter that it's

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:20,660
regular orderly symmetrical and simple

00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:23,779
so we tend to simplify so here for

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:27,769
example we tend to see the white shapes

00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:30,920
or the orange background we have to

00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:36,769
focus to see the single pieces in the

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:39,589
background it also states the principle

00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:44,689
that minds perceive external stimuli as

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:48,100
a whole rather than a sum of parts so in

00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:51,559
the first example we see one odd shape

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:56,240
we don't see the three different shapes

00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:58,309
overlapping each other in design this

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,879
means that all the elements that are a

00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:04,970
part of a whole are affected by what

00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:08,240
surrounds them and each other

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,730
in life it means that natural systems

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,950
and their properties should be view as

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:18,160
holes not as a collection of parts in

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:21,560
fact that's how we perceive experiences

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,870
holistically we don't just hear

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,050
something or see something or smell

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:31,100
something we do everything all together

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:33,620
at the same time by manipulating the

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,770
relationship between the parts we can

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:40,250
change the cumulative perception of the

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:46,460
whole for example the work that David

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:49,430
Carson does can take us aback and leave

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:54,860
us intrigued he challenges that in his

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:57,500
work so his work is always like huh in

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,690
addition to proximity and similarity

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,960
other gestalt grouping principles

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:06,830
include closure that's when the minds

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,740
tends to complete a figure even if it

00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:14,840
only sees part of it and that's why we

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:18,770
see a bowl with with spikes thank you I

00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:21,140
was like Italian for that and we see a

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:24,590
panda and we see an airplane while in

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:30,620
fact that's not really what's there our

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:34,820
minds fills up the spaces in life this

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:39,800
may lead us to jump to conclusions so we

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:42,470
have to be careful the fourth way is

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,990
through continuity our mind perceives

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,790
objects on a path as being grouped

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:53,300
together so the leaf in the H looks like

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:56,480
it's you know flying out of there or the

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,840
the cats I love you know that that cat

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,340
is always like what but it's true you

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,560
know we looked at it and we and we kind

00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:11,980
of go that can't be

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:11,980
hmm in life these can lead to prejudice

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:19,040
and so again we need to be careful

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,740
okay because it's not necessarily so

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,590
that if everyone does that means that

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,080
it's like that okay or if something goes

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,780
in a certain direction then the truth is

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,480
that you know it's not so we need to be

00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,690
aware of that

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,970
the fifth way is through simplicity

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:41,090
elements of objects tend to be perceived

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:45,410
as group if they form a pattern that

00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:49,430
it's regular simple and orderly and so

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:54,580
we see a you for Unilever and we see an

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:59,540
X while in fact they're made of smaller

00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:02,930
elements in life these can lead us to

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:06,890
generalize and it's again something we

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,810
should be aware and careful about so the

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,440
gestalt principles applied to life

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:16,640
should be reminders that perception and

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:20,510
reality may differ and things may not be

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:24,920
as simple or as predictable as we may

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:27,700
think more like the fourth principle

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,980
we're going to talk about is hierarchy

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:36,130
which is best expressed to proximity and

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:39,440
it's necessary to express priority in

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:44,360
design we can achieve higher key through

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,840
size alignment repetition this is just

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,570
an example where through type you can

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:55,700
see certain words certain concepts come

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:59,990
out more strong and before others in

00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:03,590
life hierarchy can be determined in many

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:06,890
ways and apply to many things it can be

00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:09,680
an asset it can be a goal it can be an

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:14,750
imposition or a privilege or an

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:19,790
opportunity or a penalty it still boils

00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:22,700
down to how we manage priorities in

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:25,490
design we can also implement hierarchy

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,750
through contrast and color which are two

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,309
principles we're going to talk about

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,489
next

00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:36,269
the fifth principle is contrast contrast

00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:40,489
and dominance these concepts are closely

00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:44,809
related to each other and to hierarchy

00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:48,420
in a group if there is no dominance

00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:54,619
equally way that elements are forced to

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:59,429
compete and this is true in life as well

00:15:54,619 --> 00:16:01,949
in design lack of contrast and dominance

00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:05,600
create messages that are hard to

00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:09,600
decipher and offer unpleasant experience

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,480
try reading the first part okay that's

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,230
why we have Heather's body sizes font

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,799
style to create a reading hierarchy that

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:24,989
makes it easier to discern what's

00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:28,860
important from what is less important in

00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:33,329
life contrast generally manifests a need

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:36,720
for change or form or balance that's

00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:41,689
when we argue right we argue about

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,689
something the sixth principle is color

00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:49,009
according to Alex white who was my

00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:52,339
inspiration color is partly artistry

00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:58,160
mostly science and common sense in

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:58,160
design we use color to attract attention

00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:06,659
we use it to identify and group elements

00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:13,049
there goes do that a lot my closet is

00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:18,059
color divided I'm not normal though we

00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:20,880
use it to indicate meaning ok so certain

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:23,100
things if we're this is learned but we

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,770
know that if something is red it's

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,000
something we need to pay attention to if

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:32,279
something is green

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,630
we kind of know it's okay it's also used

00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:39,630
to convey a mood and one of my favorite

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:43,789
movie director which is Guillermo del

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,789
Toro does this amazingly well

00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:58,470
and in life aside from the practical or

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,110
fashionable application this could be my

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:05,010
library it's not because I'm kind of

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:08,610
messy but it could be mmm

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:12,020
aside from that color is found in our

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:17,100
lives in more than chromatic expressions

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:22,640
people emotions friends lovers family

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:28,080
pets music food passions these likes

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:33,540
this is coloring our lives the final

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:36,480
principle is balance it's the last one

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:41,060
but it's not the least important in fact

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,810
is probably one of the most important

00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:49,380
balance can be defined as the state of

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:56,010
equalized tension though not necessarily

00:18:49,380 --> 00:19:00,510
a state of calm we define three types of

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:02,340
balance symmetrical or formal and that's

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,250
when elements are vertically centered

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:10,910
and visually equivalent on both sides

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,910
and this type evokes feelings of

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:20,550
statistic consistency tradition

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:26,670
steadiness then we have an asymmetrical

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:30,380
balanced or informal and this works with

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:35,580
white space and with aligning things

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:39,240
with with an i and this evokes feelings

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:43,650
of dynamism and modernity and power and

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:48,820
energy and vitality and then we have a

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:51,970
bad balance incredibly so

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,790
which is called overall or mosaic

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,930
balance and that's when we present too

00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:02,350
much information without contrast or

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:05,500
hierarchy the result is that our eyes

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,930
can't focus on anything when we look at

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,940
this we don't know where to look what to

00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,050
look what's the message what's important

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:16,110
what's not important

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:20,050
and so this is confusing and this is an

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,780
unappealing and in design is bad like if

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:27,910
you're my student

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:30,250
betting bet vote in life balance it's a

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:33,640
little harder to achieve than in design

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:39,210
and yet we should all strive for it

00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:43,990
a good mix of harmony priorities

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:47,560
contrasts and color combined with

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:51,850
annalistic vision and a wise use of the

00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:55,690
space we occupy are the key ingredients

00:20:51,850 --> 00:21:00,130
to design a desirable valuable

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:02,850
interesting and worthy life and with

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,430
that I thank you

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:14,469
[Applause]
