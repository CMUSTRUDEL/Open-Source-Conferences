um so what I could start off a little

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,160
antidote about I'm a lesson I learned a

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,139
long time ago

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,690
um it's apropos to what we're gonna be

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,610
talking about today so benek I actually

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,310
kind of got accidentally thrust into

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,980
enterprise web development in the tech

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,289
bubble of the 90s and was interesting as

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,019
I found myself actually working working

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,689
for banks doing customer self-help type

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,179
websites and telephony but found myself

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,840
like in these rooms suddenly with all of

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,719
these consultants from Capgemini IBM

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,129
back then was Anderson consulting you

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,480
know it's now Accenture and people like

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,190
that and we were kind of figuring out

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,940
how are we building the first websites

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,010
it was cool

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,350
this is a heady days of the 90s and we

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,180
had big budgets for doing prototypes so

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,610
we could prototype out our websites give

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,809
people tasks to do things videotape what

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,890
they were doing to figure out like maybe

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,800
what it's the best way to build

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,329
interfaces um as anything we launched

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,260
these websites but I always kind of felt

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,570
like well we weren't really getting

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,730
feedback on how people were interacting

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,710
with these websites and in particular

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,780
we're people getting confused because

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,670
most software at that time were built

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,159
for power users for people you could

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,619
train not for a common person just to

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,390
come to a web site and be able to you

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,750
know move their funds around or move

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,290
their you know move their 401ks around

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,299
the different things and so I wanted to

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,759
come analytics systems to help me

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,530
measure where you know what was going on

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,600
with the with the with people on the web

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,790
sites and what's interesting I was just

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,020
a developer I'm normally pretty quiet a

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,369
lot of these meetings and then suddenly

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,600
I started going these meetings I'd bring

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,610
some this data with me and say hey you

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,380
know I think here's a place that maybe

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,119
we've got some usability issues maybe we

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,350
can tighten up some of our warning

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,640
messages because people might be getting

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,810
confused because they're seeing too many

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,420
form submissions that aren't right

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,490
little things like that and what is

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,110
interesting is not a salesperson and

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,850
suddenly we're getting all these new

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,340
budgets to make all these new fixes to

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,659
things not a usability person but

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,780
suddenly I was getting called on in all

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,130
these meetings about either a did I have

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,750
any information about you know what

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,880
we're seeing on the website or B could I

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,380
create some of that information so that

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,060
we'd understand better what's going on

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,590
and what it kind of found was that I

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,280
actually went from being a developer

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,709
after year to being really more

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,060
strategic partner with with a lot of

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,650
clients even though I really had no

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,620
background and didn't even really intend

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,160
to do it simply because I had good data

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,680
and made common-sense sort of common

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,120
sense sort of assumptions about what

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,650
their theories about what we could do

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,870
with that data and so that's kind of

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,700
what I want to talk about today is how

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,590
can you guys it's and what if I think

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,390
that in today's world we build websites

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,160
it's a lot of heuristics it's a lot of

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,390
people who you know know go to all these

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,650
conferences and learn all these best

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,170
practices and stuff like that there's

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,580
not much data that people are using and

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,140
find that you'll learn some really

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,450
interesting things we start to weave

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:54,640
more what I call results oriented data

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:57,580
into you know into your projects so um I

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,989
kind of like to model out a successful

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,269
web server I call a results-oriented

00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,880
website it's one that it was designed to

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:06,190
attract and then it engages sort of

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,170
builds trust until we can until it can

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,019
convert converting is a thing that the

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,550
stakeholders want to happen and you know

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,870
and of course there's a lot of websites

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,090
that are built this way we're really

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:21,579
talking about today is how do we build

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,840
these websites even better so the tricky

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,489
part is that you've got something like

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,040
Google Analytics ok I wanna go back to

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,290
that slide so what a great way to get

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,790
data is Google Analytics the tricky part

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,470
about it is if you just install Google

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,540
Analytics you're gonna get some decent

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,010
data about how well a website's

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,650
attracting people or how many people are

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,500
coming to the website but you really

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,880
don't get much good information about

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,410
conversion really nope no information

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
out of the box about conversion and very

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,870
little information about really

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,640
engagement you'll get a little

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,570
information about maybe time on site and

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,970
stuff like that which can be even

00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,290
misleading high time on site can mean

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,370
you actually bad usability on the

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,049
website because people aren't finding

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:01,720
things but there are ways to to extend

00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:04,060
Google Analytics to get to those types

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,220
of numbers that stakeholders really want

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,930
the tricky part then this is not a hole

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,030
in Google Analytics at all the problem

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,079
is is that they basically out of the box

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,850
you get everything that sort of like

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,709
every website would want and it's you

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,940
know 200 different data points you know

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,739
it's a it's an incredible amount of data

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,600
but ultimately when we look at

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,400
conversions different types of web sites

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,610
want to track different kinds of things

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,870
and so it has to be cut custom set up so

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,850
they've given us a tool to

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,169
do this but we still have got to kind of

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,010
implement it kind of come up a plan for

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:35,410
it and so the first step in in in

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,449
tracking the success of a website is it

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,490
come over call a measurement plan and so

00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,560
a measurement plan basically says what

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,770
are the objectives of the business and

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,630
how can we measure them and ideally can

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,889
we put them into Google Analytics I'm

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,630
gonna kind of use that as a single tool

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,979
a lot of times they might the data might

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,510
be in some different types of analytic

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,270
systems but for now I like to just kind

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,470
of put everything into one system and so

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,910
we want to figure out like what are the

00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,710
types of things like form submissions

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,840
maybe clicking on special types of links

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,190
what's measurable and what can we push

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,570
forward some things get trickier like

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,310
tracking phone calls and only got to

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,840
bring a third-party system you know to

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,180
help with those kinds of things but we

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,830
want to develop this measurement plan

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,680
and once we understand what kind of

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,510
objectives we should be measuring for

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,160
the success of our of our websites and

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,449
our efforts where you put it into Google

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,449
Analytics using something called the

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,919
goal system and so the way goals work is

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,600
when you first install Google Analytics

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,070
there's no goals and in this site but

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,250
you can go and configure them so like

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,260
say you want to track a form submission

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,460
you can go in and you just give a goal

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,370
and name you go into the Google admin

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,320
you gave it a name something like sales

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,849
sales submission maybe it's a you know a

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,650
sales demo request or something like

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,150
that and normally what you could you

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,099
could an easy pattern that's pretty

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,010
popular is when someone submits the form

00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:50,349
it goes to a thank you page and you set

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,010
up a URL and you say ok whenever someone

00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:55,479
hits this URL trigger this goal and so

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,030
now every time someone submits the form

00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,990
the goal is triggered the other thing

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,389
that's really kind of interesting is

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,729
that it's just to note is that goals

00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,650
will only count once per session each

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,699
each goal so different forms so and

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,199
that's actually kind of good because

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,880
like if someone say hits the back button

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,500
and hits that thank you page again we

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,820
don't want the goal to trigger again you

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,650
know if someone submits the form again

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,240
it's not like they're really we got any

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,610
more benefit of a second time they did

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,260
it so in general it's a good it's good

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,560
behavior they only trigger once per

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,639
session I want to say session you know

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,860
basically the way Google Google

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,780
Analytics you know tracks all these hits

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,190
that happen on a website and it groups

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,570
them together in a session so when

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,909
someone first hits the website that's

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:37,000
the start of a session and basically it

00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:39,810
collects everything someone does until

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,700
there's a by default a 30 minutes

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,170
nothing happens and then it says okay

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,130
we're shutting out this session and

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,290
everything that happened during that

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,700
time that's now up as a part of our

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,810
session you can change it from 30

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,610
minutes but generally those people just

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,690
leave the default one other thing it's

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,370
pretty interesting about goals is you

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:58,710
can pass a value and Google Analytics

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,090
tracks its value or interprets its value

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,639
kind of interestingly they interpret

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,930
sort of like as a currency because

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,630
they're basically trying to try to

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,160
encourage you to say what is the value

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,930
of this thing happening in business

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,669
terms I sometimes like to use the term

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,110
utility because some people kind of get

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,060
hung up that I don't know exactly what

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,340
it leads worth or I don't know exactly

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,480
what you know certain things are worth

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,980
but it is sort of meant that with

00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,500
something we want to drive towards and

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,300
so I kind of guys like level one

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,460
analytics it's just installing Google

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,860
Analytics level two and a big jump is

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,360
you know getting your goals going so you

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,820
know you might very well have a lead

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,710
generation website and your tracking

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,320
form submissions and maybe your tracking

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,560
phone calls but in reality phone calls

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,320
are maybe only half as effective at

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,419
generating sales as a form might be

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,820
that's where that value can come into

00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,620
play so instead of just saying oh well

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,390
you know we want understand say what

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,490
blog posts are you know just doing the

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,890
most conversions we can weight them so

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,870
we might say okay well our form is worth

00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,490
a hundred and since we get half the

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,740
conversion from phone calls we're gonna

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,780
make that worth fifty and ideally what I

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,910
like to do is you can think of it it's

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,650
just a way to wait and just kind of have

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,550
like a random you know just kind of like

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,620
a abstract set of units but ideally I

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,200
like to try to if you can bring it back

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,610
to what's the value to the organization

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,930
you know sometimes if you're doing leads

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,820
you might very well say well you know

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,419
every lead we get is worth this you know

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:26,250
the customers worth this and we convert

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,780
one in four and you can kind of like

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,830
work the math back depends on what

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,210
you're you know depends on what your

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,890
goal what you're tracking as far as how

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,630
you might want to do it and it could be

00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,539
tricky but I encourage it it's a good

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,909
exercise just to do it and what I find

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,260
is this is an area where people people

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,710
will find it a little tricky doing this

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,270
um but what you know cuz as humans we

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,260
want very accurate numbers and a lot of

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,420
times it's hard to make a lot of

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,550
assumptions on how we're gonna value our

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,690
goals but you know I'd say is it's much

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,310
better to have a fuzzy number around

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,990
something meaningful you know sort of

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,310
adage of the person looking for their

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,720
lost keys where there's bright light

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,060
instead of where they actually lost them

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,860
you know just because you you you

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,720
there's bright light around accuracy we

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,790
really want we just want to have some

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,390
good a good estimate and we can always

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,940
iterate on it later so the the

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,860
stakeholders they're gonna love knowing

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,500
these numbers these are wide number

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,480
oriented numbers around these big macro

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,580
conversions happening but the people who

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,710
work on the websites the UX people the

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,839
marketers the people generating content

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,160
those kinds of people a lot of times

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,440
they want to track other things that

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,420
call micro conversions I'm actually gen

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,860
say I at Google if you go through some

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,430
of the Google training go talk about the

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,320
same thing and so and what you know a

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,970
lot of times micro conversions are is

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,910
they might be showing progression

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,290
towards a conversion or they might be

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,420
something that provides value in a

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,339
different way so you know a lot of times

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,680
if you're doing a good job in content

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,000
marketing you might become an authority

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,470
and if people aren't necessarily buy

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,540
from you but are champions of your brand

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,670
sharing your content and so someone

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,260
doing a social share might provide value

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,180
it's not necessarily directly related to

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,470
an end goal um but it still provides

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,000
value and so a lot of times it's good to

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,600
set these things up is what I call micro

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,910
conversions the tricky part about micro

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,980
conversions is that goals are not

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,300
normally the best way to track them we

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,010
only have about twenty of them so like

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,510
let's say we were gonna track social

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,920
shares and you were to try to track oh I

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,120
want social share on Twitter on Facebook

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,220
and whatever you can run out of these

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,680
goals pretty quickly the other thing is

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,570
are only counted once per session and so

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,820
there is another way that we can count

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,339
these things using another subsystem in

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,560
Google Analytics called events and so

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,870
events actually are a lot more

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,180
sophisticated than goals we can actually

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,550
kind of attach three different levels of

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,020
data instead of just a name we basically

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,850
like a category and action and a label

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,900
we have a value just like we did with

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:47,430
goals and we can also add extra day to

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,140
these using custom dimensions I won't

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,610
get too much into it but because a

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,690
little advance but it's something we can

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,300
do and we've basically of an unlimited

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,470
number of these things we don't even

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,230
need to set them up in Google Analytics

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,150
like we do goals we just we just use

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,770
JavaScript to push them over you use tag

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,410
manager just do JavaScript on your

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,720
website to do those kinds of things and

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,310
so you know what what I like to do is

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,889
is let's track every meaningful

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,350
interaction on the website as a as an

00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:15,269
event so you know how far people scroll

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,720
down pages how far people scroll through

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:20,579
videos you know if they click on see TAS

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,230
click on so you know go to a social

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,850
profile you know those different types

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,279
of things want to set those up and track

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,480
they do have to custom be custom done

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,949
there are no events right out of the box

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,709
in Google Analytics you have to you have

00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:34,139
to implement them custom and so what I

00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:36,420
like to do is you know I could say is

00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:38,220
kind of at that level to analytics

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,199
you've got your goals all set up and

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,740
you've got them valued but a level three

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,540
is now taking your micro conversions and

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,240
scoring those also to kind of give some

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,410
fine detail that the UX people and other

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,110
people working on the website a lot of

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,579
times interested in um and so you know a

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,459
lot of times I even sometimes will like

00:11:53,579 --> 00:12:00,089
to score on some traffic metrics and

00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:01,439
then I normally do score engagements and

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:04,220
you know sort of trust-building as

00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:08,100
events and then our big macro goals as

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,470
as conversions so there's a little bit

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,019
of a hack that I figured out a few years

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,389
ago the one tricky part is that events

00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,389
don't actually the value doesn't track

00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:20,879
the same way value doesn't a goal and I

00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,680
want them to like for if say someone

00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,910
shares in social and I associate ten

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,250
with it I want to be kind of considered

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,620
like utility value and so actually kind

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,139
of a simple hack to do this is may track

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,730
everything you can with events and I

00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:34,559
like to use a convention of putting a

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,110
plus if it is meant to trigger a goal

00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,970
and I put an explanation point if that

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,189
value is meant to be interpreted as

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,930
utility and this gets a little advanced

00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:45,059
some of this so you know there's some

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,379
things are kind of on the on the more

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:47,639
beginner side if some things on the more

00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,139
advanced side so don't worry if you

00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,339
don't get all of it that you know the

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,420
video will be up and you can kind of

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,430
come back and look at some of these more

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,319
advanced things later but this is a

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,329
little bit of you know I think a great

00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:59,970
way to learn some good information so

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,199
for example if I've got a video scroll

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,529
is gonna basically tell me how deep

00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,329
someone Scrolls into a video and I might

00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:08,309
want to be a percentage and I just

00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:10,350
represent that percentages what zero to

00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:12,660
a hundred or something like that and so

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,670
what you do is I can have the the name

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,809
of this event be video scroll and then

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,440
normally what I want to do is I want to

00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:20,209
I'll have the title of the video and

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,129
of the video so look at YouTube I might

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,350
have it like YouTube : and the YouTube

00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:26,240
hash ID for it that way if I ever need

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,730
to I can go and run a report of all my

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,170
videos on the website and get an average

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,720
of how deep people are scrolling into

00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,920
them an event that might trigger a goal

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,139
would look something like this

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,000
a form gets submitted we want to trigger

00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:39,470
the sales submission so I put a plus and

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,180
I have goals that are set up to look for

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,910
that sort of pattern where it basically

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,589
has the word sales submission with a

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,120
plus at the end and then what's kind of

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,250
neat about this is because we didn't

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,810
just do a regular goal as a URL we can

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,790
associate things like which form got

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,009
submitted and you could actually pass

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,040
another event that might be form view

00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:59,180
and you can divide the actual

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,649
submissions by the views to get

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,300
conversion ratios and things like that's

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,480
why I like to put some sort of

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,629
identifier on the event so I can like

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,459
compare those things later on um and

00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:12,110
then like the social share this one

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:14,269
simply is gonna be social share we want

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,069
to count this as utility value and so I

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,379
put an explanation point at the end and

00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:20,089
so that way when I run my reports I can

00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:22,040
later say no I don't want to I want to

00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,319
do my reports well total up all the goal

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,540
values and any events that have an

00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:28,970
explanation point and contribute them

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,380
back to whatever it whatever it is on

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,610
the website that's driving that kind of

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:36,199
value so we've kind of looked at metrics

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,149
how you know the big thing you know the

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,130
big takeaway from that is just need to

00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,110
look at measuring the things that define

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,019
interactions that define success on the

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,029
website and ideally put values around it

00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,279
to wait how important these things are

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,930
and all the numbers in Google Analytics

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,870
really fall into two categories there

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,009
are dimensions alright any other data in

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,329
Google and falls into two categories

00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,040
there's dimensions and metrics so we

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,649
looked at metrics first we never look at

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,540
dimensions um and the way I like to kind

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,649
of think of it is dimensions are relay

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,980
I'll explain it it's sort of that

00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:09,139
dimensions are kind of like buckets and

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,000
every time something happens metrics are

00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,069
like putting a marble into that bucket

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,290
so let's say for example someone comes

00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:17,029
to the website and they start by going

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,220
to blog a well it's gonna put we're

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,809
going to put a session marble in the

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,699
bucket we're going to put a page hit in

00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:25,279
the bucket if next to go to another blog

00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:28,309
post it'll now have a page hit go into

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,800
that bucket if let's say they see a call

00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:31,980
to action for a ebook someone wants to

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,170
download

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,089
then they can go to that offer they

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,070
submit the form we have to thank you

00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,589
maybe they go to blog C and then they

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,060
leave the website after that and so you

00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,820
know these are dimensions and buckets

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,680
now if you're if we just had so that

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,810
level zero analytics with no goal set up

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,959
this is what we'd have but because we

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,880
did set up a goal look our goal would

00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,769
have triggered here and so let's say we

00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,920
valued someone something that forum is

00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:02,970
25 what's neat about this is now we can

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:06,029
actually attribute that value upstream

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,550
so we introduced the page people came in

00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:10,110
on so we could then look at okay let's

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,050
look at all the different blog posts we

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:16,140
have which ones are creating the most

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:20,820
value because the way that value maps

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:22,920
back so um what's neat is there's a ton

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,769
of dimensions just available right out a

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,209
box with Google Analytics the content

00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,980
ones are pretty self-explanatory pretty

00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,029
straightforward it is kind of neat

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,029
though that you look at like sort of

00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:35,040
like just at a in session page path or a

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:37,709
landing page meaning this is the first

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,839
page of a session also you can look at

00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,399
traffic sources which a lot of you

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,740
people doing marketing or constantly

00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,329
looking at these and what's really neat

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,399
is if you set up all your success

00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:49,199
metrics you can do things like I want to

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,660
look at all the value organic searches

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,339
delivering versus a PPC or if you're

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,260
doing PPC your keywords will be coming

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:57,810
through and you can look at the value

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,769
each keyword is producing and if you

00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,640
know what your opinion of course you're

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,019
going to know what you're paying for

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,199
them so they can kind of start to

00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,189
calculate an ROI on those there's a lot

00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,079
of other segments you can look at

00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:09,630
audiences one of my favorite things to

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,610
look at is devices even though we're all

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,040
doing these responsive sites a lot of

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:17,189
times the usability and sort of the the

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,689
customer journey kind of like the

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:20,699
customer journey mapping gets a little

00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,559
lost sometimes particularly the tablet

00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,579
sizes and so a lot of times you can do

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,750
things like okay I want to look at

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,000
everyone has looked at the website on

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,360
mobile phones tablet size and desktop

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,760
and do I see a significant drop in value

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,110
that one of these sizes is doing might

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,580
need to be looking at some of my UX the

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,790
typical thing happens is you know you

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,740
might have a right column CTA and in a

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,080
mobile size it drops down below the

00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,790
content and people don't see it so it

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,790
might not show up so you know a lot of

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,260
times

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,049
that it's a good way to identify some

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,910
issues along those lines but there's

00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:53,740
there's a bunch of others there's some

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,540
cool ones around PageSpeed so you can

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,370
actually look at okay if by page loads

00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,480
in this amount of time or if I get if

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,580
it's this amount of time to get the

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,650
first right or to get the full render or

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,200
things like that how much does my value

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,820
drop off on my website and so it might

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,669
be the argument for tuning some things

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,100
up maybe installing you know responsive

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,660
images or lazy loading things like that

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,520
moving to a different host things along

00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,780
those lines we start to understand some

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,799
of those and Selig's its find that kind

00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,630
of just explore through all the

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,220
different dimensions they have google

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,860
annex has another really powerful system

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,780
we can define our own dimensions called

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,750
custom dimensions and given that we have

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,090
a CMS we can push some things from the

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,100
CMS over to Google Analytics and look at

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:35,410
some pretty interesting types of

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,299
breakdowns so custom dimensions

00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,860
basically you set them up in Google

00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:40,750
Analytics and you define a scope

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,150
it's either hid scope session or visit

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,070
or I'll show some examples and so you

00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,570
define them in Google Analytics but then

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,370
you use JavaScript once again to send

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,929
them over and you get 20 of these per

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,980
property and they can be up to 150

00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:56,320
characters long so what I love to do is

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,360
so out of the box and we set up our

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,490
success metrics we know for example all

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,230
the blog posts how much value they're

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,630
producing but we might not necessarily

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,330
know why what is it about those blog

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,370
posts that is producing that value maybe

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,160
it's the way the author writes maybe

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:15,100
it's the topic you know maybe it's the

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,630
the tone that we're using a casual verse

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,480
corporate tone or something like that

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,220
well we can push this data over into

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,780
Google Analytics and then we can break

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,970
it back and so you might be hey I've got

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,830
14 blog posts are written by this one

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,179
author and 28 they're written by another

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,500
author I can look at the total value of

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:31,090
all of them divided by the number of

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,400
posts and I can get a pretty good handle

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,590
on who's writing better posts in fact

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,970
actually at our agency we use that and

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,169
it sort of gamified it between all of

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,240
our developers we're supposed to write a

00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,440
couple posts every month and they all

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,059
got pretty competitive about the

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,900
business value suddenly their posts work

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:48,700
we're delivering so those are fairly

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,049
straightforward now the next two are a

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,030
little bit more advanced I'll just say

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:53,620
them for just so you know what's

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,110
possible they're a little bit trickier

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,880
to set up but visitor attributes you can

00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,169
do things like hey if someone shares on

00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,539
our website we might label them as a

00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,399
social

00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,359
sher and then we can segment out you

00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,070
know what those types of people are

00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:07,369
doing you can actually do things like

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,320
counts what topics people are looking at

00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:10,850
and kind of figure out what topic is

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,590
someone interested in and then you can

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,479
break that down by okay let's look at

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,889
say people who are hunters versus people

00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,850
who are gatherers you know because

00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,710
they're looking at that type of content

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,809
what types of change in behavior are we

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,549
seeing on our website you've got system

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,340
status so is someone a user what user

00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,809
role are they are they a subscriber or

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,729
something like that and then you can ask

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,729
for certain data in form fields

00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:33,049
someone's job role psychographics

00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:34,549
demographics so forth and they'll all of

00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:37,940
that can be pushed as custom dimensions

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:40,220
into google analytics section attributes

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,440
are an interesting one there's not a ton

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,619
of I find less use for him but the few

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,899
use cases I found form are very powerful

00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:50,450
one they could be used for sort of a be

00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:52,999
multi variant testing and so what I call

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,799
concurrent split tests and so even if

00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:57,739
you're using something like a visual web

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,389
optimizer what I like to do is even

00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:03,259
though what visual Web optimizer might

00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:05,869
have a control and and a variant one I

00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:07,759
want to push that data as a session in

00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:08,840
as a session variable into Google

00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,629
Analytics so they can do some deeper

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,649
analysis with it and so that's all that

00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:14,840
really means is that you know a

00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:16,820
concurrent split test is people come to

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,830
the website and a certain percentage of

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,899
people are shown one variant and other

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,970
people are shown another variant what's

00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,919
really powerful and I think it's lost a

00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,139
lot is what I call release testing

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,720
release testing is basically split test

00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:32,059
where the control is the way the website

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,669
was in a prior version and then you

00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:36,859
release a new version and that's your

00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:38,779
now new version and so if you're if you

00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:40,669
can if you push that hey here's the

00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:42,710
version of our website we're on you can

00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:45,769
then compare how did we do in version 1

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:48,440
verse version 2 or 1.1 universe 1.2 and

00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:52,159
so forth and what's what's really neat

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,129
about this is that you know doing

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,479
continuous integrations tough you know

00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:57,799
when you get into like enterprise type

00:21:56,479 --> 00:22:00,649
sites and you're running things like

00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,179
b-hat tests and I mean maintaining all

00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:03,379
of that like let's make sure the look of

00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:05,330
the site looks perfect all this kinda

00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:07,369
stuff it can get you know pretty complex

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,659
it's pretty expensive to maintain and I

00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,889
think it's really out of the budget of

00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:13,070
most like mid-sized organizations oh but

00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:14,480
this

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,340
is actually a good way that hey you

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,470
launched the new website did we see a

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,090
significant drop in our usability might

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,850
because we broke something you know

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,500
maybe we updated a module and someone

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,600
broke one of our forms or something like

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,389
that and so these are good smoke tests

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,970
and even if you know the product owner

00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,590
comes says oh you guys this this color

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,730
changed on our website or something like

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,990
that well you know what let's make the

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,029
argument yeah but we're not seeing any

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,559
different difference in value that's

00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:41,570
being produced after we did that release

00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,620
so it's not really having an impact so

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,899
we'll go ahead and we'll go ahead and

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,899
correct that one of the other things I'd

00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:49,490
like to do is do responsive breakpoints

00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:51,110
so because Google doesn't know where

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,909
your breakpoints are in your responsive

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,620
themes so you know basically say if I've

00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:57,740
got a browser below this then I want to

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,509
be X extra small small medium so forth

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,950
and then you can break down your reports

00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:03,289
and maybe see if there's maybe there's

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,899
certain breakpoints in our responsive

00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:07,519
design that might have some issues so

00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:08,840
what do we do with all of this data you

00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,120
know we've got all these success metrics

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,519
measuring the important interactions on

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,919
our website and then we've extended our

00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,870
Domenic's tended our dimensions so we

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,340
can segment down and look deeper into

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:23,000
certain areas what do we do with this

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:25,009
information um so I've always kind of

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,190
liked this idea is that all the ultimate

00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:30,320
goal is to drive this data to make sure

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,750
the entire team or the entire

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,860
organization is learning and getting

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:38,960
smarter about how to do web development

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,860
so there's a there's a book that came

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,539
out several years called the fifth

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,299
discipline that's basically about how

00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:45,500
you create learning organizations so and

00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,299
you're the first thing is you gotta have

00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,059
smart people making good you know making

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,370
good decisions you've got to have good

00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,899
mental models so you know so the idea

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,490
that you go to conferences you learn hey

00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,200
this is the best way to do this design

00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,309
or this is the best you know kind of way

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,200
to do you extra this is the best

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,460
marketing channel the best way you know

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,649
do these different things and it's

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,730
always a good place to start but what

00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:07,250
you need to do regularly is be

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,539
challenging those mental models because

00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,250
they're not always the same across all

00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:12,830
kinds of different sites and sometimes

00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,419
they just change and so we can use data

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,490
to challenge our mental models and

00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,919
improve on them you also want a shared

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,850
vision um this is one of the areas I

00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:21,200
think's interesting is it particularly

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,970
can do a larger website we've got the

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,820
developers that are worried about things

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,990
like technical debt and complexity

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,390
security things along those lines you

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,920
the UX people that looking to do trendy

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,090
stuff sometimes and things that are

00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,410
interesting you've got the usability

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,360
people you know there might be try to

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,340
make things simple but sometimes you

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,080
know at the expense of emotional

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,150
branding on the site and so what I like

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,130
about like using data is it's a so now

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,140
we're gonna use this sort of roie number

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,600
this utility value and that's gonna

00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,160
drive our decision-making now that

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,690
doesn't mean that you don't care anymore

00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,740
about technical debt those kinds of

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:56,210
things but now you've got something to

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:58,040
weigh it against and then team learning

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,590
and so that's where I think like having

00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,850
that number having that number where

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,100
people can see hey we just made these

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,840
changes to the website what kind of

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,030
effect did it have you know and they'll

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,990
learn people start to pick up that hey

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,370
these kinds of things are things we want

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,280
to look for but one of the biggest

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:15,050
things we want to do is develop a kind

00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,179
of a culture of systems thinking and

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:19,550
I'll show you a little bit of like how I

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:21,080
like to think of a website so kind of

00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,750
think of a website systems think is that

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,000
we've got got this website sort of like

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,500
a black box we can't observe exactly

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,050
what people are doing on it but we can't

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,040
observe our inputs and outputs and in

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,750
particular we want to see is what

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,850
happens when we change an input what

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,020
does it do to our outputs and so you

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,610
know the typical way of building a

00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,960
website you get your requirements you've

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,880
got your best practices and mental

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,850
models and your inputs you know can be

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,470
creative features people are coming to

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,510
the website content you're adding to the

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,309
website and then we want to do is we use

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,980
Google Analytics with our goals the

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:55,309
built in analytics and events to measure

00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,660
the output ideally we can value them so

00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:57,650
we've got sort of a single number to

00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,630
look at when the great things about a

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,220
single number is it's something that

00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,120
most people can really understand so

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,650
I've looking at a bunch of different

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,970
types of metrics if someone's a design

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,980
or someone's not necessarily a data

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,600
oriented person you know having that

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,830
single number look that's good and then

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:15,050
we've got to create this feedback loop

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:16,460
so feedback loops so we've talked pretty

00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,360
much all about the collection side of

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,800
Google Analytics

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
there's the reporting side so there's

00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,490
you know there's a lot of stuff good

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,010
stock reports in Google I cut you can

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,750
get pretty bewildering generally what I

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,970
find is that there's maybe a two or

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,230
three go-to reports but beyond that

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,850
you're generally gonna create a custom

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,410
reports so there's a way to kind of a

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,970
quick way to create custom reports it's

00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,559
an older way of doing it but it's pretty

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,169
powerful and then there's the newer data

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,860
studio which is very powerful you bring

00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:42,780
data in from other sources and all kind

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,260
of interesting things but it's got a

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,450
learning curve to it so a lot of times I

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,660
find it might just be easier to export

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,760
and you know put it into Excel and put

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,610
some things together and then there is a

00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,900
data API which allows other systems to

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:03,059
read this data so what I like to do is

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,650
you know get pics some inspection points

00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:06,059
so I kind of lose like I kind of break

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,320
down websites like there's websites are

00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,450
just a project or someone says we want

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,950
to build this website and we want to we

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,970
want it to be good for five years and

00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,140
then we'll redesign it five years from

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,900
now we're not going to do anything else

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,640
to it and these people some of these

00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,990
people really should be continually

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,679
improving their website they just don't

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,480
realize it

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,549
they think the website should be a so

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,690
I'd like to do if these people is let's

00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:27,480
figure out the important things to

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,010
measure let's put this analytics set up

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,220
on their website and then let's go back

00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,900
to them in a quarter or six months and

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,150
let's just show them some of the data

00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,350
and say hey here's an opportunity I

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,850
think for improving that so we think

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,340
those interesting how many people have

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,049
moved from thinking their site was just

00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,340
a project to realizing no there's

00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:47,130
actually a lot of things that we can do

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,450
to improve this site using data then

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,190
there's a second level site it's like

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,410
okay we're going to basically build all

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,600
the features we want in one sort of

00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,130
waterfall project but we're gonna give

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,270
you a continuum marketing in particular

00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,940
going to do content marketing we're

00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,010
adding content we're doing SEO doing the

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,630
social engagement things like that and a

00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,040
lot of times we find is there's going to

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,120
be an editorial calendar planning so

00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,620
you're planning your content and so

00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,110
forth or maybe there could be things

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,640
like content optimization meetings or

00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,950
things like that that's a great time to

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,419
bring that data in you're particularly

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:19,350
doing good segmentation around those

00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:20,429
pages ideally if you're on a big big

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,870
project where they say no we're

00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:22,440
continually going to be building this

00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,350
website

00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,910
ideally in something like scrum bring

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,320
the data to your backlog grooming and

00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,549
splint planning meetings if you're not

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,380
familiar scrum those are just your

00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:33,090
planning meetings basically where you're

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,340
saying how what's going to be the next

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,540
important thing we're going to tackle

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,309
and so you know if you're using a

00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,540
waterfall method there's a now there's

00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:41,309
analogies to they're just kind of called

00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,299
different things and then one of the

00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:45,630
other things I really would like to do

00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:47,580
is to bring this stuff into the user for

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,140
an interface with CMS itself because

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,850
that's where a lot of people live like I

00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,640
said one of the coolest things ever saw

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,780
happening is it kind of unattended is

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,490
when I deployed a system to help

00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,440
do this and it put a tab on everyone's

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,210
blog posts where they could see a

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,160
scorecard of the business value their

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,140
blog posts were doing suddenly they

00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,970
started self-organizing and gamifying

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,370
around building better blog posts

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,850
because they could see the data

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:13,770
um so adapting I like to change that

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,300
mentality of hey let's try it you know

00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,410
let's build this great feature -

00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,230
thinking of like we think this feature

00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,350
is a hypothesis and we need to test it

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,340
and sometimes you test it using a be

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,260
sometimes like hey this is we think it's

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,790
so great we're gonna just release it and

00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,950
then we can do the release style testing

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:31,860
just test did it really improve or not

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:34,230
improve our website um but it's just

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,850
that mentality of when we make changes

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,260
we need to think of them as experiments

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,850
as hypotheses that need to be proven

00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,810
regularly analyzed to discover value in

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,370
a lot of times it's going to be hey

00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,690
let's look at some bigger bigger end

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,490
reports and then if we see something

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,190
interesting happen let's dig down and

00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,510
get down into our our dimensions and

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:55,350
maybe figure out like why that's going

00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:57,000
on and then use the value that number to

00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,580
priority to focus a team and help them

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,530
prioritize and be focused around one

00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:06,060
idea so um so you know this is a this is

00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,860
kind of a concept that you know we would

00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,950
implement we used to implement like in

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,780
the 2000s type time frame and then

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,100
eventually like this is just this is a

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,930
lot of work to do this manually so I

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,270
started a project and I'm actually a

00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:21,120
Drupal developer originally so it was in

00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,320
Drupal back in like 2012 2013 and we

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,390
actually a lot of people ask us to port

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,950
it to WordPress so we did and so

00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,380
basically we've kind of we basically

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,960
built a system to help help these things

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,670
happen it's a plugin um I was gonna show

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,860
you guys real quick if anyone wants to

00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:36,360
get involved in this project you know

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,640
either it's just you know feedback we've

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,080
got a lot of backlog ideas on what we

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,490
want to do and be good to have some

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,650
direction of how people are using it or

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,690
if you're actually developer you know

00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,040
and want to get involved or document or

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,140
anything like that just show it kind of

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,390
real quick so one of the first things we

00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,940
do is there's a whole API system for

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:56,550
doing events so like if there's another

00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,750
plug-in or if you've got a theme and you

00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,610
want to track certain things you can

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,410
just hook into the system and whenever

00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,880
you install it those those events will

00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,480
start automatically happening in Google

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,430
Analytics wanted to make it really easy

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,440
to do things like set up goals

00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,870
so we kind of created some interfaces

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,850
where it'll automatically go from

00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,290
WordPress and you don't have to go into

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,870
Google Analytics to set up the goal it

00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,960
will do it automatically from

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,520
automatically from WordPress and then

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,540
make it available as like drop downs so

00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,970
you can just set them on things like

00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,590
different form submissions maybe

00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,130
different types of link clicks things

00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,130
along those lines

00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:45,380
it's called intelligence yeah it's Intel

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,240
intelligence WP yeah so that's the

00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,680
websites W intelligence WP calm it's

00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:55,330
just intelligence you know plugin slash

00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:55,330
intelligence on on wordpress.org

00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,690
then wanted a way we're sort of like

00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,950
here's our scorecards here's all the

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,629
different events we think are important

00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,159
and we can look at like what are all the

00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:13,129
values were going to associate with all

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,509
of these things and then allowing things

00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:16,789
like you can customize them at a forum

00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:19,580
level and so forth and then bringing the

00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:20,659
reports back into back into WordPress

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,549
and in particular we're tried to do is

00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:24,649
get people away from vanity metrics if

00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:26,840
just hits and sticks and stuff like that

00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:28,580
and get them focused on value that's

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,220
being delivered and kind of breaking

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,599
that down into traffic value sort of

00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,970
that micro conversions and macro

00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:36,649
conversion value and then we do things

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,090
like make it easy to compare different

00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:39,320
types of content so you can say oh I

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,549
want to compare it just all the

00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,509
different blog posts and things like

00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,389
that because we're pushing all that

00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:46,309
stuff through again doing something

00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:47,989
where like every you know authors can

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,450
see a scorecard of the business value

00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:52,519
their contents generating just off their

00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,440
blog post and then doing things like

00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:56,450
make it easy to dig down into segments

00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,830
so like for example a little hard to

00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,429
read but the top one we're breaking

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:03,739
breaking reports down by content types

00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:04,820
this one's by authors so and see like

00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:06,440
which authors are delivering the most

00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,289
value this one's like number number of

00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,320
words in an article for like what length

00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:13,460
of article is kind of optimal this one's

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,700
the words are all blurry but that one's

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:21,580
all topics basically your category

00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:24,859
taxonomy z' and stuff like that so um

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:27,609
hope that's helpful that's what I got if

00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:27,609
you guys had any questions

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:39,049
thanks people analytics set it up on

00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:43,820
everybody stuff that I do

00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:46,600
and then I'd go away yeah so now I know

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:49,670
a little bit more

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,670
[Music]

00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:03,580
so out of the box there's a bunch of

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:06,550
built-in dimensions oh yeah okay

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,090
so the question is our dimensions a part

00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,480
of Google Analytics built into Google X

00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,270
right

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,590
so um okay the dimension concept is

00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:18,490
actually core to Google Analytics and

00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:20,680
then it basically has it has ways of

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,420
doing some stock ones so a perfect

00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,610
example is going to be is there's a

00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,920
dimension called device and device can

00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:29,200
be mobile it can be mobile tablet or

00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,150
desktop and it'll automatically track

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,130
those for you right but you can also

00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,320
custom dimension so like one thing that

00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,670
Google Analytics doesn't know is what

00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,500
the break points of your themes are

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,240
one-time breakpoints like you know

00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,980
normal ears like say five breakpoints

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,630
and you know we've got desktop and then

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,070
down to mobile so it doesn't know so

00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,700
what you could use a custom dimension to

00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:51,150
do is to basically say all right for any

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:55,000
viewport that's this size I want to push

00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:57,430
X extra small and for this viewport size

00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,450
I want push small medium large and extra

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,880
large something like that and so that

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,770
way that's that's like basically

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,840
customized dimension that you created

00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:07,060
for custom information from your website

00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,670
so things like pushing things like a

00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,020
blog author Google Analytics doesn't

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,760
understand what that is it's not saying

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,550
that's built in but you can create a

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,100
custom dimension and my that's author

00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:21,130
and then you can push the author of your

00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,750
posts into that dimension and now your

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:27,970
report you can start segmenting reports

00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:29,530
down by authors it will it will require

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,390
JavaScript now that's another thing like

00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,500
if you use intelligence it automatically

00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,060
handles all that stuff so it'll

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,770
automatically start pushing your authors

00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,750
and Incept acts on amis and all that

00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,970
stuff in the admin so a lot of this was

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,590
sort of like how people didn't have to

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:43,210
use JavaScript to do a lot of this kind

00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,810
of stuff or even tag manager to do a lot

00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,810
of this kind of stuff

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,680
we're still going into the Google

00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:54,230
Analytics console to set up those

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,980
parameters no it'll set it all up

00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:59,570
automatically for you yeah okay so

00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,860
you're at is asking if you use

00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,090
intelligence you still have to go into

00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,950
Google Analytics and set those things up

00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,290
not not the current versions know that

00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,400
in the early days you did but yeah I

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,110
know the current version when you first

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,390
set it up it'll go do all your custom

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,410
dimensions for you and then it'll

00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,990
automatically start pushing all that

00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,980
extra data along and so that was one of

00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,300
the big things there's only make it a

00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,890
lot easier certain I having to jump back

00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,760
and forth between Google Analytics you

00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,190
said a lot of that stuff either

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,440
automatically or from inward because

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,580
there is like an API a management API

00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,960
for Google and like so it's just using

00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:31,520
the management API for Google Analytics

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,350
to allow configuration out of WordPress

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:52,850
to make the changes to your Google

00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:55,130
Analytics account the question was so

00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,500
you can customize for those that don't

00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,330
know what UTM parameters are you can

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,590
customize like there's a something

00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,660
called a campaign which is not normally

00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,070
set but if you if you control the link

00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,080
you put like a question mark UTM

00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:08,540
underscore campaign and you could say

00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,820
pass hey there's a PPC campaign or this

00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,500
is like our Christmas special campaign

00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,260
or something like that and then it will

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,930
yeah it will it will track all of that

00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,270
back to any of its in the end those UTM

00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:22,250
parameters are just dimensions and so

00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,960
this stuff gets tracked back to all all

00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,480
the dimensions so just like value gets

00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,410
tracked back to medium and source even

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,660
though you're kind of custom

00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:36,710
implementing on the campaign it will

00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:39,210
track back all those how heavy is it on

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:41,400
a website and

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,170
you say for example take it off take it

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,150
off your website does it still

00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:49,770
everything in Google Analytics so what

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,589
it actually will do is it actually

00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:57,150
create okay yeah so the question is if

00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:58,890
how heavy is it and does it if you

00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:03,210
remove it what everything's still be in

00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:04,770
Google Analytics so yes in fact one of

00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,150
the reasons we created it was because

00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,930
there's some really cool analytics you'd

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,630
get out of marketing automation

00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,710
platforms like HubSpot or Marketo or

00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,060
Ellicott stuff like that

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,740
but the problem is we had clients that

00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,450
kept changing platforms and they didn't

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,339
want to lose their data and so like

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,300
let's just you know do like CTA track

00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,710
and stuff like that let's move into

00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,260
Google Analytics so that way when we

00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,900
move platforms we can keep that data so

00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,030
the data is there if you remove it

00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,400
it'll stop track I'll stop tracking some

00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,080
of that stuff and actually the way it

00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,760
works is if you already have Google

00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,109
Analytics on your website it will

00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,240
actually create a second Google

00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:37,680
Analytics accounts that's configured

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,410
because it configures things a special

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,700
way so it won't mess up any of your

00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,619
current any of your current

00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,910
configuration although that current

00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,500
configuration is blank you can do things

00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,030
like copy goals over and then track them

00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,150
in both and you can to any in google

00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:53,190
unless you can track like into multiple

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:55,200
google alex tracking IDs and so then if

00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,060
you if you uninstall it your other

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,890
Google Analytics is just tracking normal

00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,710
the data will always stay there I mean

00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:03,780
you own the Google Analytics account um

00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:05,040
but you know the the data going into it

00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:10,619
would stop if you want to remove if you

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:12,119
removed it um you know that's it that's

00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,220
an interesting question you know I try

00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,410
so it's it's actually a pretty direct

00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:19,830
port from a Drupal module and I mean a

00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:23,130
lot of codes the same um I have not

00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:24,330
noticed a major slowdown or I've noticed

00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,520
significant slowdown but there's

00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:28,320
sometimes a little bit and the thing you

00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,910
know like and this is where a little bit

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,420
my lack and WordPress I was like in

00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:35,220
Drupal everything is cached so if it

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,200
takes if it takes you know 300

00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,820
milliseconds more to build a page it's

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,070
no big deal because it's all going into

00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,470
cache and reverse proxy and and so forth

00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:45,660
which I'm assuming most WordPress is set

00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,070
up that way also and like when I host my

00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,690
WordPress sites to do on Pantheon so

00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,730
they're stuffs all set up to do the

00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,109
reverse proxy caching so it doesn't

00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,800
really you know it doesn't really make

00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:54,450
it it doesn't really

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,090
make any sort of impact but most time it

00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,220
might add 150 milliseconds 200

00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:16,650
milliseconds something like that to a

00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:19,680
page load okay do this I'm really post

00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,520
on SlideShare I'm like SlideShare Tom

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,870
dude or something like that

00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,770
actually that my SlideShare up there I

00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,000
don't um all posted up to SlideShare if

00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,810
someone wants to thing just email me

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,160
using the email address on there oh my

00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,570
gosh actually is like a really old email

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,570
address on there they also get to me

00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:40,460
yeah I'll tweet it out when I you know

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,460
when I do it my post

00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,160
it's very time

00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,650
[Music]

00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:06,940
um is that intelligent that probably is

00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,599
that's probably relate to some plug-in

00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,599
or theme you have

00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:18,960
right I know it okay I'm just curious

00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:21,839
with that one line mmm does that mean I

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:28,289
click on it and it's gonna send it up

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:30,479
for me generally no and so you know okay

00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:32,519
yeah yeah so the question is if your

00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:34,140
websites telling you that you need to

00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,380
install Google Analytics with you if you

00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:41,009
click the link will it set it up for you

00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:42,869
so you actually have to create at least

00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:44,069
one Google Analytics account because you

00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:47,700
got to go through all the Google

00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:48,989
Analytics permissions in terms of use

00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,910
and all of that kind of stuff

00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:52,650
there are some plugins and intelligence

00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:55,339
does this actually once you've created

00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:58,019
the first one it then can create any any

00:41:55,339 --> 00:42:00,150
extra ones after that so the plug-in

00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:02,579
might create and then after that if

00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,140
you've already created a Google

00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:07,140
Analytics account but yeah you'll always

00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,759
have to create one because you a plug-in

00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,720
won't have permission to understand like

00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,720
where to create it otherwise

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,590
yeah I'm probably like what that link

00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,850
would do is take you right to Google

00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,190
Analytics where you create the account

00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:27,670
and it's it's a pretty if you've already

00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,080
got a Google profile it's pretty

00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,820
painless process to create a Google

00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,750
Analytics account it's not even bad if

00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,490
you have a profile just got to create

00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,730
the profile first then the Analects

00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,730
account

00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:43,199
[Applause]

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,199
[Music]

00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,640
okay

00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,929
[Music]

00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,619
[Music]

00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,280
[Music]

00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,980
yeah I'm not familiar with that okay

00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,150
yeah yeah yeah no no I appreciate you I

00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:29,520
appreciate you reminding me so the

00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:32,870
question is on wordpress.com would you

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,940
need to upgrade to premium to install it

00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:38,240
from premium to business to install

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,240
Google Analytics

00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:49,510
you know I'm not familiar enough with

00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:51,940
how wordpress.com is set up so I don't a

00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,730
hundred percent no it would probably be

00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,840
odd though that you couldn't add it some

00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:57,640
way and there's so many different ways

00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,870
to do it it might be though that there

00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,610
might they might have some sort of field

00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,710
and you can't use like their particular

00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:08,020
field you might have to add as a widget

00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:10,120
you know or something like that yeah and

00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,010
I'm sure if you google it there'll be

00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,350
tons of people have an answer for it if

00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,490
there's a way to do it because that

00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,720
seems like something people write a lot

00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:19,060
about but yeah I don't know enough about

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,480
the wordpress.com platform to tell you

00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,480
one way together

00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,410
um consolidate in the sense that you

00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,940
basically want to have multiple websites

00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:48,180
act as like a single property

00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,950
oh and he's asking the question can you

00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,490
consolidate the data from multiple sites

00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:55,290
um and so our so you're saying like

00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,610
maybe like a company has got five

00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:01,970
different websites and they want to

00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,970
track across all five of those what okay

00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,080
there is okay there is a way to do it

00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,290
depending on what you're trying to do

00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,460
the tricky part is this Google's gonna

00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,220
do all of its tracking through first

00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,860
party cookies which have to be set by

00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,850
JavaScript on that domain so as soon as

00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,610
you go to another now if they're all

00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,840
subdomains it's not a problem you can

00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,550
there's a way to set what the cookie

00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,330
domain is and if everything's set up as

00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,260
subdomains

00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,600
you don't have to do anything special

00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,160
you do one thing you gotta go set the

00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,630
cookie value in fact actually

00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,880
intelligence has a way to even set it

00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,310
also and you just say don't set it at a

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,900
subdomain level set it at a domain level

00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,790
and that way the cookie will track

00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,180
people at all the subdomains but if

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:45,390
you're going to if you've got multiple

00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:47,130
domains um the problem is the cookie

00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:49,050
will get lost when people go from one

00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:51,060
domain to the other there is a way to

00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:54,240
correct for it it's a little tricky

00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,590
though and I forget exactly it's been a

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,780
long time since I've done the process

00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,600
but basically there's a special type of

00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,120
URL and you have to encode some extra

00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,030
things in the URLs that go from one site

00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,830
to another site and that way that

00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,320
information is what allows Google

00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:13,350
Analytics to seem together the sessions

00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,910
across those there are some other sort

00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,250
of advanced techniques for doing that

00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:21,270
there's kind of some ways to like use a

00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:23,610
use a an iframe to kind of like maintain

00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,720
your sessions across but it can be a

00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,720
little tricky but like I said Google

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,580
official way to do it is the cult-like

00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,100
cross-site tracking or something like

00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,769
that but it does involve modifying your

00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,329
link zone between the

00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:38,279
how many good comfortable one or two

00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:46,619
quick questions on the end here and here

00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:47,909
okay yes yeah okay so yeah you're right

00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:50,309
so I'm gonna put it all into the date

00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:52,769
same data set but you could create oh

00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:55,499
the question was could you use data

00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:57,630
studio to pull together multiple sites

00:46:55,499 --> 00:47:00,029
and yes no thanks for bringing that up

00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,319
yeah so um because it might not be a

00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:03,719
good idea to have it actually broken

00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,880
down into different data sets but with

00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:07,199
data studio you can bring multiple data

00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,239
sets I mean just google analytics I mean

00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,469
even bring data from all kinds of

00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:13,529
different sources into it so yeah you

00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:15,479
can easily say I want you know this

00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:16,829
report from this data set this report

00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:18,389
from this data set this so you create

00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:19,619
like sort of a universal dashboard or

00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:20,130
something like that for a client or what

00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,089
have you

00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,089
yeah it's good point

00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:34,800
