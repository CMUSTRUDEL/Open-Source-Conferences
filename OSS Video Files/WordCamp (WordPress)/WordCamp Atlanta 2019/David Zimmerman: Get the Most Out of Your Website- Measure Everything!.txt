Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	Rather than waste money on magazine ads and coupon books, you’ve invested in a website to promote your business. I’m sure it’s a beautiful site. You might even get some traffic. Congratulations!
Is that traffic beneficial? Are your marketing efforts actually working? Is it helping grow your business?
I’d like to show you what you can do to better understand traffic to your site. I’ll explain the different ways you can measure your site. I’ll show you which are helpful, and which are distractions. In fact, we’ll start to develop a digital measurement plan for your website (and your business).

thank you all for joining us today like

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,120
I said earlier this is naptime for me

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,179
and all I ask is that you don't snore so

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,160
it's also the day after May the 4th so I

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,230
wore my favorite Star Wars t-shirt and

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
if you're a nerd enough you'll get the

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,670
reference because it's like a double

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,000
entendre and I even wore my stormtrooper

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,830
socks because cuz well you got to

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,990
celebrate May the fourth right so it's

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,219
we decided to revenge of the fifth so

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,210
yeah well close enough so I my name is

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,880
David Zimmerman

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,430
I own a internet marketing consultancy

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,440
called reliable ACORN I've been in

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,559
internet marketing especially search

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,660
marketing for about 10 years now four

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,660
years ago I went out on my own started

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,110
my own thing and I tell you over all

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,129
this time I've learned that the most

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,050
important thing anybody can do when

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,090
using their website to promote their

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:06,960
business is to measure everything you

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,310
know this is where the power of internet

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,280
marketing comes from you know we're not

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,380
buying a radio spot and hoping someone

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,280
sees it or hears it I guess it's ready

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,049
to a spot they're gonna hear it right

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,900
shows you how much I know about radio

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,560
marketing but I do know that it's really

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,310
hard to see if something like that helps

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,670
you you know you you might say oh I'm

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,170
gonna buy a magazine ad in this magazine

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,659
periodical oh hey well that might great

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,220
and you might spend a lot of money and

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,820
think it's I spent so much money surely

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,119
it's going to work but then you'd kind

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,340
of feel like it works and that's really

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,890
disappointing and that's why I don't do

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,270
that kind of marketing because I like

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,979
the power of the internet marketing

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,540
because we know if it works or not the

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,390
power of internet marketing is our

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:06,060
ability to measure everything we do

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,290
there is a problem though and it might

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,350
be why you're here today

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:15,110
because there's so much data

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,840
are you supposed to believe what are you

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,520
supposed to do should you look at your

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,490
bounce rate should you look at the pages

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,860
per visitor should you look at the

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,290
what's the difference between a page

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,040
view and a visit and a session and a

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,830
user and and so we have analysis

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,960
paralysis and we look at all this stuff

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:42,520
and we're like looks good but it gets

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,050
worse when we're paying for advertising

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,460
maybe we're doing Adwords maybe we're

00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,820
doing Facebook maybe we're doing

00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:52,840
snapchat and we have to ask ourselves

00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:56,060
after we're paying for this traffic or

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,190
impressions not of necessarily the

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,450
accuracy of the data they're presenting

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:05,000
to us but is Facebook giving us data

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,760
that helps us to know it's effective or

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,710
as Facebook gaming as data to make

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,370
Facebook look really good so we keep

00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:16,640
spending money with them and we we we

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,880
have all this numbers and they it sounds

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:27,650
great to have 10,000 impressions on our

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:32,420
Facebook campaign but did that help mmm

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:34,490
it feels like it did it it might have I

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,760
surely it did something

00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:41,660
we're losing the power in our confusion

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:47,440
and so what I'm hoping to do today is to

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:51,070
provide for you a solution a solution to

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,570
analysis paralysis in marketing data a

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:57,760
solution to whether or not you should

00:03:53,570 --> 00:04:06,040
believe or trust this particular metric

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:10,970
the solution is a measurement plan now I

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,230
know we're all busy and I know that we

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,930
just kind of want to get down to the

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,750
nitty-gritty and if you are at Nathan's

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,600
talk yesterday about making sure you

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,280
have the time to plan ahead even though

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,400
you don't have the time to plan ahead

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,970
right this is where we all live but as

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,590
with

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:33,860
most things in life time to make a plan

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,510
and develop a strategy we'll end up

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:41,240
making everything more efficient

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:44,990
allowing you to have the power that you

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:49,240
need to understand what marketing is

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:52,820
working what marketing is wasting money

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,490
where you should double down and where

00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:00,320
you should cut off because you have a

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:04,850
measurement plan to understand what you

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,390
should be looking at so let's start an

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,390

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:15,830

decisions there you go that's your

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:53,179
objective your business I think that's

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:58,649
great to get a snowspeeder

00:07:53,179 --> 00:08:02,789
now right at the camera that's gonna be

00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:06,119
great on WordPress TV for your reference

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:11,249
I bought three of these yesterday only

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:14,639
two mate here so so it's important to

00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:18,419
kind of summarize and distill what your

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,849
business objective is because once you

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,529
know your business objective you can

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:27,360
move on to the better episode episode

00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:30,360
two how will your website accomplish

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,800
these objectives right remember one more

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,250
time that business subject is really

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,349
asking for kidding about the web but

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:41,430
step two is to say okay great you've got

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:45,509
a wordpress site how is that site going

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:49,379
to accomplish these objectives so let me

00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:53,550
let me suggest some of your websites are

00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:55,610
selling things to accomplish your

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:59,220
business objectives you've got a product

00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,920
people you want them to buy it it will

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:05,519
better their life if they have it and so

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,420
they want it but I think

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,809
that a lot of business owners forget

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:16,860
that websites can do much more than just

00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:21,629
sell a product for instance me I don't

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:26,100
really sell a product I want my website

00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:31,339
to give me leads right my business

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:33,389
objective involves giving my clients

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:33,959
reliable internet marketing advice and

00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:38,069
services

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:44,129
I need clients to do that I get clients

00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:47,429
when I get leads right but some of you

00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:50,699
have a business it's brick and mortar

00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:54,779
give a shop you're paying rent you need

00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:58,129
people to come in your door that's what

00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:02,759
your website needs to accomplish in

00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:05,869
others maybe you're selling ads on your

00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:08,490
site maybe you I've affiliate marketing

00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:10,470
revenue that you get from your site your

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,889
business objective is really all about

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:17,549
publishing content to get more of the

00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:20,850
kickback right so there's several ways

00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:22,709
there's probably more than this but

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,689
there's several ways a website could

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:28,379
accomplish your business objective and

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:32,309
and frankly sometimes if you're using

00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:34,049
more of these right like my business

00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:36,089
objective is to help clients by

00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,389
providing them the most reliable bla bla

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:37,860
bla bla

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:41,490
you got it I don't wanna sound like an

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,730
advertisement but so I want leads but

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,199
I'm also publishing right that's a way

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:52,249
I'm providing that advice I have clients

00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:55,649
who who sell machinery

00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:57,649
industrial machinery but some of that

00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,699
industrial machinery is you know

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,980
five-figure machines and no one's gonna

00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:06,689
give their credit card to buy a $50,000

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,819
rock crusher right so really it's a

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:11,549
website that's selling rock-crushing

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,839
machines and it's not really selling it

00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:14,459
you're sending the lead to a sales

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,329
person who then follows up so it's

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,940
selling in leads some who want to get

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:23,010
people in the door

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,440
they want to get people the door but

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,250
maybe they sell a little bit online -

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,400
right

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:32,070
sometimes you combine these together so

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:36,780
so uh my two victims I mean participants

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:38,910
right what hell is your website going to

00:11:36,780 --> 00:12:03,390
help you accomplish your business

00:11:38,910 --> 00:12:13,110
objective okay okay okay okay okay yeah

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:19,940
yeah sure sure

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:28,700
yeah yeah

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:32,220
right right right

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,010
okay but you hit on an important point I

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,860
think you might not be getting a lot of

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,420
leads right now but ultimately that is

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,000
what you would like to get out of your

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,780
website right right because publishing

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,420
and stuff like that is really about

00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:51,660
getting deletes right so your website

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,370
helps you get leads maybe not many yet

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,100
but that's okay we are all there right

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,990
and so you you're one way your website

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,120
accomplishes your business objective is

00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,580
through leads and that's great how much

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:08,360
you what is your how does your website

00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,360
help your business objective yeah

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:25,080
okay so you have a product but does that

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:25,620
fulfilled through the lead okay okay

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,540
okay

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,010
great right so we all need to think

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,740
about this how this applies to our

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,690
business objective what our website is

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,459
or of what do your clients websites

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,920
business object what does your clients

00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,500
websites do for their business objective

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,579
well we have to make a distinction

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,440
between macro and micro when it comes to

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:51,510
how a website could accomplish a

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:53,670
business objective macro means what is

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:57,920
the thing your website will do that will

00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,420
get you closest to the money micro is

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,490
something that gets someone closer to

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:07,709
the thing that finally gets you money

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:10,860
right so in my case I want leads but I

00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:12,870
have an email list all right I don't

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,750
make money from my email list I don't

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,209
sell my emails right don't put affiliate

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,070
links in my emails well sometimes I do

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:23,510
but that's not my primary source of

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,740
income right but the micro lead of

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:29,250
getting someone sign about my email

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,250
address is to get someone to fulfill the

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,020
macro lead which is the the sales lead

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:38,310
hey David I need your help I'm going to

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,630
pay you money that is where I make the

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,510
money I make the money when I get the

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:46,800
leads sell the client then they pay me

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:48,779
but I you can't confuse the macro and

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,870
the micro and I think that's where some

00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:53,959
of us go wrong sometimes there's our

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,520
website's want to accomplish everything

00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,890
and there's a lot a website needs to do

00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:03,529
productively but let's make a

00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:06,180
distinction between the macro goal

00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:09,120
meaning the thing that's closest to when

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,670
we get paid as the website owner or the

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,399
business that owns the website and what

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:19,019
are the micro goals which get us closer

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,820
to the thing that gets us so we can put

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,190
this in context with social media for

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,680
example it is awesome to have a bunch of

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,879
Facebook followers

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,459
then unless you named Kardashian the

00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,589
number of Facebook followers doesn't

00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:36,740
well okay Instagram followers doesn't

00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:40,220
get you money right

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:44,059
that is a micro goal that gets you

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:46,339
closer to their follow you on Instagram

00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:48,019
they see your post to interact with you

00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:50,119
they begin to trust you they begin to

00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,040
rely on your expertise and then when

00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:54,259
they need your help they call you there

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,619
you go they've called you they've become

00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:59,809
a lead that's the macro goal so when

00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:02,720
we're looking at all the data that we

00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:06,649
can look at we have to ask what is the

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,790
most important thing closest to where

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:12,470
you get paid that's the macro goal

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,899
everything else is a step towards that

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:19,309
in a micro goal

00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:21,619
following me any questions so far all

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,429
right let's continue that so episode 3

00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:27,860
is where it starts to get a little

00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:30,699
interesting how can you measure them we

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:34,220
know what our business objective is

00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:38,319
we've we know how our website will help

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,970
us accomplish that business objective

00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,559
how are we going to measure them this is

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,529
where we get the power of marketing

00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,829
through our website because we should be

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:49,879
able to measure everything and that's

00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:51,740
why we should all have Google Analytics

00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,709
on our site right

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:58,429
there's many number of ways to measure

00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:00,589
data about our website jetpack has their

00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:03,199
own you know within that's the same zone

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:07,699
if you have a wordpress.com site using

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:11,750
jetpack data there's other things like

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:13,970
Facebook data that you could use I think

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,490
everyone really has no excuse not to

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,589
have Google Analytics on their site it's

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,709
easy to set up it does have a treasure

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:23,470
trove of debt how many of you have

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:28,279
Google Analytics on your site right now

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:31,159
okay great you're getting there problem

00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,630
is there's a lot of data there right how

00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,179
do we filter through this how do we

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,070
figure out what we should be looking at

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,590
but the first step is just to install it

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,390
any number of easy

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,299
to do it monster insights is a great

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,650
plugin that makes it very easy if you

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:46,570
want to go a little more advanced you

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,250
can install an instance of Google tag

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,650
manager on your site and let that serve

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,220
up a Google Analytics it has a lot more

00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:58,000
flexibility for you but at least get

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,559
analytics on your site somehow once you

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,760
have analytics on your site

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:09,580
you're not done because you need to

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,679
connect the thing that your website's

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:18,490
helping you do to get to your business

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:20,590
objective to Google Analytics okay if

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,490
you're selling something on your site

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:27,149
that means you need to send the

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,070
e-commerce data into Google Analytics

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:32,200
you might be using a WooCommerce or

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,120
something like that sometimes if you're

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,010
using Shopify outside of WordPress

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:42,580
there's ways to set up your system to

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:45,370
simply send the transaction data send

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,799
the number of the number of dollars that

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,480
someone have paid like you want all that

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,669
data to go into your Google Analytics

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:58,330
account because that is the macro goal

00:18:53,669 --> 00:19:01,240
but you want to accomplish if you are

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,760
trying to get leads you need to set up a

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,669
Google Analytics call as a goal and what

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,250
that means is whenever someone submits a

00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:12,640
lead from your website you need it

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,659
tracked and Google Analytics will handle

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,750
that event in a different fashion if I

00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:22,299
recommend using a lead form on your

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,010
website because if everyone will come to

00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:26,200
your website they have to use the form

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,750
to contact you and it's very easy to

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,080
track form submission in Google

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,809
Analytics specially set up the form to

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,059
go to a confirmation page because then

00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:39,520
all you got to do is say hey Google

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,799
Analytics this is the URL for the

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,899
confirmation page anytime someone visits

00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,190
the confirmation page the only way they

00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,370
got there is be submitting the form

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,399
therefore I know I got a lead there's

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,590
other ways to do this like you could put

00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:56,340
your email address on

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:59,010
on your website but if you don't connect

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,590
that to Google Analytics all you know is

00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,720
I got people submitting or contact me by

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,059
email but you don't have the power of

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:11,150
Google Analytics to say how they found

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:13,350
you and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,510
yeah the contact form is the same as the

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,390
lead form you can use that a number of

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,730
form plugins but I wreck all ways

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,289
recommend using a confirmation page I

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,210
think it's a better user experience

00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:27,120
because it confirms the user that you

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,559
did get their lead there nothing more

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,190
frustrating to me when I fill out a form

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,510
on a website

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:37,799
and the form resets did did did did I

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:40,770
waste my time did they get it then I'm

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:43,500
anxious and I'm like I'm done

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:46,860
like I'm out of here so set up your form

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
so it goes to a confirmation page if

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,570
your website is trying to get people

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,510
into the door and that's your business

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,179
objective it's a little more challenging

00:20:54,510 --> 00:21:00,390
but you can still track it in Google

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,010
Analytics what if you have a page in

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:06,750
your site on directions to get to your

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:08,669
store right I hope do I mean you can use

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,210
you know google my business and stuff

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,919
like that

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,600
but have a page in your site what and

00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,779
you measure how many people are getting

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,850
to that page as a way of saying people

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,250
are interested enough in my business

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,159
that they want to get directions to my

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,779
store so now you know you have

00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,330
successfully interested people and

00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:30,809
coming to your store you want to get a

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:34,529
little more sophisticated you have a web

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:36,570
only coupon that they have to give you

00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:39,090
their email address to receive now when

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,590
they give you that coupon the only way

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,059
they got it was because they went to

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,809
your website so you know that is a

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,279
website lead right and we just fancy

00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:49,260
things we can do with Google Analytics

00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,610
to see how they found you to get that in

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:56,640
the first place but you want to track

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:59,490
the goal the macro goal that is closest

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,980
to making money in Google Analytics now

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,039
if you're a publisher you're informing

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,190
people you are using if trying to sell

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,259
affiliate links

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,529
you selling advertising on your site to

00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:14,320
make money great now we just need to

00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:17,950
know things like how many pages per

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,590
visit because the more pages per visit

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:24,220
the more peep ads people saw the more

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:27,210
you can charge for people that are

00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:30,909
advertising that you're saying right

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:34,990
things like that but by setting up the

00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:38,409
tracking we're able to do something

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,690
important and I kind of struggle with

00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:44,649
how I wanted to call this macro micro or

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:50,110
a primary secondary ended on this some

00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:53,289
data is primarily connected to what your

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:56,919
website does to accomplish a business

00:22:53,289 --> 00:23:02,730
goal that's your primary data was a lead

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:06,610
collected did someone make a purchase

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:10,240
did someone download the coupon that's

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:12,340
your primary goal and you need to make

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:18,370
sure you're able to track that in Google

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:20,409
Analytics if it's something that data a

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,830
piece of data that helps you understand

00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:25,679
how people are getting to there but

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,470
that's a secondary piece of data

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,029
so because glance will come to me and

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,629
say well what do I rank what do I rank

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:36,850
what do I rank David hey that's cool I'm

00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:39,549
glad you rank and I could go on a

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,169
tangent and white who cares but I won't

00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:46,139
go there let's pretend it matters where

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:50,889
you rank that doesn't make you money

00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:55,740
to rank I can think of dozens of

00:23:50,889 --> 00:24:00,000
keywords for which you rank number one

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:03,340
that don't bring any traffic to you

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,789
so keyword ranking if you're doing

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:11,679
organic efforts really is a secondary

00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:14,619
metric that leads to traffic because you

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,390
don't really want to rank you want rank

00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,600
that generates traffic

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,040
but you don't really want traffic

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,600
because we could get you traffic for all

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:31,490
kinds of crazy ideas you want traffic

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:36,190
that produces a sale that's your primary

00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:40,790
goal sales from the secondary goal

00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:46,549
traffic as a result of another secondary

00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:48,710
or tertiary goal ranked Facebook you've

00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:53,320
got a million impressions for your

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,320
promoted post yes awesome

00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:00,919
did any of those people come to your

00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:03,559
site okay so now we've got a secondary

00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:08,120
metric called impressions that leads to

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:10,070
clicks of the clicks because you've

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,840
installed Google Analytics now you know

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,730
how many clicks became traffic and it's

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,640
not always the same because they're

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,710
calculated differently but more

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,010
importantly how many of that how much of

00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:24,980
that traffic from your Facebook Ads

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:29,750
accomplished your primary goal of your

00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:32,260
website this is where Facebook ads

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,700
become really misleading in their data

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,730
they tell you all this really cool

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:41,870
information but it doesn't necessarily

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:44,929
translate into the bottom line so we

00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:47,929
help by understanding what our business

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,640
objective is how our websites

00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:53,090
accomplishing that business objective

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,790
and what we're tracking as far as our

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:58,390
business objective goes we're able to

00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:00,890
determine this is a primary metric or

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,540
it's a secondary metric Secretariat

00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,860
metrics are good you want to but you

00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,840
have to have impressions in your

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,360
facebook ads if anybody is going to

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,120
click on them but that's not it in

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,309
itself if people click on your ad great

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,059
it's just an expense to you unless that

00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:19,160
traffic and clicks become traffic but

00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:21,350
traffic doesn't really do anything for

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:26,870
you unless it accomplishes the primary

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:30,110
goal of a lead or a sale or someone in

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,410
the doorway of your store or seeing a

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,780
lot of

00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,990
ads on your side or whatever your

00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:43,010
primary metric that you're tracking yes

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:45,260
following me so far okay so now that

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:49,550
we're able to establish our business

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:53,030
objective see how our websites going to

00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:55,520
accomplish that and decide and set up

00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:58,060
the tracking to measure that now we can

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,850
get to the best episode of all four and

00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:06,700
we can know how we can evaluate our

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:09,920
website's success so your data you know

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:13,010
so because you set up tracking you now

00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:17,330
see your report in Google Analytics and

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:21,650
you've got a hundred visitors from from

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:27,470
Google organic yes and those 100

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:34,490
visitors became three leads awesome is

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:35,950
that good I take three leads could it be

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,110
better

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,960
could is is that a month where I'd

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:45,440
you're you can't just take the data the

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:48,890
data the numbers don't need anything by

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:54,440
themselves this is why we have to begin

00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:57,920
to segment our data we can segment or

00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,160
data across several dimensions one is

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:04,430
date you've got three leads as a result

00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,350
of a hundred visits this month but you

00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:10,100
got ten leads as a result of three

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:12,740
hundred visitors last month now you're

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,980
able to decide whether the three is good

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,550
or bad because you've segmented the data

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,470
three doesn't mean anything unless you

00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:24,440
have something against which you can

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:27,440
compare it so one of the most common

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:32,090
ways to compare data is by using a date

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:37,580
comparison another way is source of the

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:39,080
traffic you got a hundred visits from

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,990
your Google organic search traffic

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,260
thanks to Google Analytics you know that

00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:50,570
you've got five visits from your

00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:53,299
facebook ads which was more effective by

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,679
segmenting the data you now know

00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,330
especially when you're able to go the

00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,669
primary objective and see that Facebook

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:02,330
brought no conversions the Google

00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:04,130
organic brought a bunch right segmenting

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,750
the data according to the source of the

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,990
traffic helps you to compare now you

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,429
know double down on your SEO maybe you

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,770
either need to completely revamp your

00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:16,309
Facebook ads or stop giving Zuckerberg

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,770
any more money but you won't know

00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:21,830
whether it's successful or not unless

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:25,309
you're able to segment the data another

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:28,250
important segment is location if you are

00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:32,770
a local dog walker it doesn't matter if

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:38,390
someone in LA comes to your website

00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:41,240
because you're in Atlanta but if you

00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:45,140
look at your data by location suddenly

00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:48,260
that matters so another way to look to

00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,120
see if the data is good is by segmenting

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,620
and according location and another way

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,960
you might look as new versus returning

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:58,549
right for instance like organic search

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,760
does a really good job bringing new

00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:05,120
visitors in social does a really good

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,640
job bringing returning visitors in but

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,320
of the newer returning visitors which

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,230
are more likely to convert not everyone

00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:17,179
converts on the first visit so now you

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:19,549
can look at the primary tracked goal of

00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:22,520
your website that helps accomplish your

00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:25,880
business objective in terms of these

00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,570
segments and mind you blow you away

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,850
combining segments your Google Analytics

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:34,370
Google search traffic from last month

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,960
brought in more leads from your hometown

00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,330
than it did the previous month

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:44,419
now you've combined all your segments

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:48,200
and you know that is working and now you

00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:51,110
know where to spend your money where to

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,760
stop spending your money and that is the

00:30:51,110 --> 00:31:00,490
real power of measuring everything off

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:04,310
your website creating a measurement plan

00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:07,640
helps you know what you should be

00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:10,250
looking at what you can be ignoring what

00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,840
is working what is not where you should

00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:17,390
be spending your money where you should

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:19,910
stop please start today on their way

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:23,210
home think about what is your business

00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:26,390
objective how does your website

00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:29,050
accomplish that how are you gonna track

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:33,260
it how are you gonna segment your data

00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:36,050
to know whether it's working or not now

00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,780
I have a little link here if you want

00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,220
some more notes I have some a video from

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,920
Google that kind of worked through how

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,580
to create a measurement plan some other

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:49,220
resources that might help you create it

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,260
things to share with your team with your

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,500
partners to help you kind of figure out

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,790
this together if other times have given

00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,960
this this has been the topic of

00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,910
conversation on the Monday morning

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,040
meeting the next day as they kind of

00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,600
work through these problems so this

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,750
might be a great resource for you start

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:10,660
and you know what I'm tracking you

00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:13,340
because I want to know how effective

00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:16,400
coming to Atlanta was I mean I had a

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,890
good time don't get me wrong right but I

00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,680
want to know how effective these efforts

00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:26,480
are so if you click on the link you'll

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,400
see the URL is not the URL this URL I'm

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,640
using tag manager I'm not tagged measure

00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,960
a Google URL builder to say hey you know

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,610
what so many people came to your website

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,580
as well as a good result to go into

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:45,230
Atlanta and of those this many people

00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:48,650
became clients now I can compare it Lana

00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:51,130
to Birmingham and that's right I'm

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:55,580
comparing you to Birmingham and I know

00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:58,460
what was worthwhile because we need to

00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,870
be able to measure I mean I'm hoping to

00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,760
help you guys right I'm not here to sell

00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,530
but please I don't want to be that guy

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,320
but I want you to think about in terms

00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,840
of your business - right don't just

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,640
throw something against the wall and

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,730
hope

00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,110
it works that's please don't do that as

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,390
a waste of your time and money and

00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:19,350
marketing measure everything get the

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:22,210
most out of it alright thank you guys

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,130
I'm happy to take some questions I think

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,830
we are wow that was quick

00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,310
we have lots I have no more Lego but I

00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:46,990
do have an maybe some answers yes sir

00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:49,360
yes sir okay so we're talking about the

00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:53,160
question how is that URL tracking the

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:57,460
success of this here and now okay so

00:33:53,160 --> 00:34:02,820
this URL is set up as a redirect on my

00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:06,340
website it redirects to the landing page

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,110
which I forget offhand what it is but I

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,460
also don't want to say it because I

00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:13,030
don't want you to visit it without going

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:15,040
to the tracking but there's a tool

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,530
within Google Analytics called the URL

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,170
builder and what you can do is you give

00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:23,890
it certain parameters and you can say a

00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:29,700
source of traffic a what is the other

00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:32,380
dimensions the campaign the the content

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,750
keyword where it's appropriate things

00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:39,280
like that so I filtered in data like

00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:42,070
this came from word camp Atlanta blah

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,870
blah blah right and so in Google

00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,750
Analytics when I look at my Google

00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:49,690
Analytics data it won't say so many

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:52,420
people typed in reliable a corncob slash

00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,790
plan which would be in Google and others

00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,220
considered a direct traffic which

00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:59,110
doesn't really tell me much

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,350
instead it in Google Analytics they'll

00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:04,450
say the source is WordCamp

00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:08,020
the content was this particular

00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:09,640
presentation right and so I now it's

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,790
added more information inside Google

00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,280
Analytics so now I can see this traffic

00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:17,560
came but obviously I have lead tracking

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,850
checked up if you submit a form through

00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,080
my site I'll know how you found me right

00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:26,410
I tell you

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:31,720
clients always want to know how their

00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:34,390
leads came in right I get personally

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,150
angry when I have to fill the lead form

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:41,860
and the lead form makes me say how I

00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:44,260
found them that's your job I'm the

00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:48,090
customer don't make me do your marketing

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:54,010
for you that little offensive to me

00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:57,040
besides it's never accurate I have I

00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:59,410
have a client that always is part of the

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,860
process of on board and they ask how did

00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:04,420
you find us inevitably they say we found

00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,720
you by going to Google and searching for

00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:11,710
this but cuz we have lead tracking on it

00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,090
I know it's not right this person did

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:15,940
not really find you from Google organic

00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:18,960
this person found you from Bing because

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,190
guess what you Google people on Bing

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,730
right and they didn't know they had

00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:26,820
their browser said anyway you if you set

00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:30,880
up your tracking right you don't have to

00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,680
let your customers be their marketing

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,290
data you'll have to make them feel like

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,570
they're a piece of meat you just another

00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:41,410
you can make them because you've set up

00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:43,440
your tracking to be able to attribute to

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,620
them any other questions

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,620
yes ma'am

00:36:52,090 --> 00:37:02,210
yes so good good question so the

00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:04,580
question is is there a way to know where

00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,690
leads came from from the first source

00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,580
okay

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,770
this is an interesting thing on how

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,640
Google Analytics tracks visitors and

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:17,270
therefore leads Google Analytics

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:20,330
attributes a lead to the last non direct

00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:25,970
visit okay so if you're following me

00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:28,670
that means if the last way they found me

00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:33,500
besides simply typing in the URL to my

00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:36,410
website so they could have before they

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:40,160
convert it so if I know I got so many

00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:44,359
leads from organic search what that

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,640
means is the right before they contacted

00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,250
me that did an organic search but they

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,070
might have months before started

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:54,140
following me on Facebook right so Google

00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:57,080
Analytics is limited in this ability

00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:00,200
because it doesn't do a good job saying

00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:03,020
how they first found me and so maybe

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,510
they they went they found me on social

00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,530
media and then they go in to my website

00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:11,599
then they sign up for my email list and

00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:15,310
then after receiving emails for six

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:18,770
months they finally googled my name and

00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:20,570
filled out a form in Google Analytics

00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,970
that's to be considered an organic

00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:25,520
visitor in a lead from organic search

00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:28,130
but Google Analytics does not do a good

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,510
job tracking that far back other

00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:35,210
analytics platforms that aren't free do

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,980
a better job at that there is ways to

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:40,010
get a better view within Google

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,710
Analytics at multi-channel kind of data

00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:46,670
but it's not how its set up by default

00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:48,349
and so you get to find the data because

00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:51,109
of a lot of what I do I'm more

00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:53,660
interested in last click attribution but

00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:56,720
for more of a if your business is a

00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,460
longer buying cycle and it takes a lot

00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,930
more touches before someone has enough

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,220
credibility to trust you home health

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,109
care might be a great example of that

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,789
where they're going to real

00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:08,690
they want to make sure they trust you

00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:11,630
before well yeah law firm so actually

00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:13,789
law firms different law firm is I just

00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,980
need a lawyer and lawyers are very

00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:21,349
aggressive so last click attribution

00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:25,339
works really well for law firms but with

00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:27,980
other things that it's not as effective

00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:32,380
so at tribution model is what this is

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,380
called and that's a very good question

00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:57,769
so the question is how do you how do you

00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,720
present data to clients in a way that is

00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:01,400
a little more manageable okay

00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,369
so there's several tools that are

00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,039
available google has a product called

00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:09,259
data studio which allows you to import

00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,390
your Google Analytics data and your

00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:14,349
other data from other sources combine

00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:16,789
them in one nice neat looking report I

00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:18,859
mean you can just really neat stuff with

00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:22,369
that it'll involve a lot of setup for

00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:24,920
you but sometimes it's a great way to

00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:28,309
provide your client with the data that

00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,079
matters to them I mean rather than

00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:31,369
getting them distracted by going them

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,529
down the rabbit hole of Google Analytics

00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:35,359
I love I mean my clients should all have

00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:37,400
access to their analytics absolutely

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,640
they should own that account by the way

00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:44,450
not I should not be the delegator they

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,849
should own that data however they get

00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:51,880
confused and they go oh my gosh my

00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:54,019
bounce rate is terrible is it because

00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,890
blog posts are always going to have a

00:40:54,019 --> 00:41:00,499
high bounce rate because blog posts mean

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:03,470
someone came to your website for a

00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:04,759
question found your blog post answered

00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,980
it and left because their question was

00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:11,509
answered so guess what that's a bounce

00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:13,309
that was a successful visit or if it's a

00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:15,930
bounce they came to your website called

00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:17,550
your phone number they are

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,950
lead but because you didn't set up phone

00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:22,530
call tracking we don't know that their

00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:24,540
lead and it looks like balance it looks

00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:28,410
terrible but in reality it's a success

00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:30,270
and so I like data studio I set up a

00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:33,150
little basic report that just weeds it

00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:35,160
down to the very basics and and they can

00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:37,650
literally look at that report at any

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,870
time they feel like they want to look

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,300
and it has some limited segmentation

00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:44,760
there's also ways to set up unique

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,990
dashboards in Google Analytics and some

00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,040
of my clients they'll set up a dashboard

00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,170
and just have Google Analytics

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,390
automatically email them the relevant

00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,730
data I actually do that for all my

00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:56,280
clients I'm tomorrow morning 7 o'clock

00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:59,460
Google will send me a bunch of different

00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,420
reports for all my clients I use that to

00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:05,010
say oops someone removed the tracking or

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,540
oops someone removed a major section in

00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:09,060
their site and the traffic dropped and

00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,430
they didn't tell me about it right I'm

00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,460
am I the only one all right maybe I am

00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:16,950
but thank you but like I send these

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,170
reports mostly for me to keep up but I

00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:21,690
can also in the custom report dashboard

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,820
of Google Analytics set up the data only

00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,890
and I want to see and that ends up

00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,210
making it really efficient for me so I

00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,090
just go through all those reports real

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,980
quick no problems move on oh there's a

00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,390
bunch of 404 errors on that client site

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,120
I'm going to take some time to look at

00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:40,050
that fix that problem so those are two

00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:44,540
good ways to do that yeah great any

00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,540
other questions yes yes sir

00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:51,009
you are able to use bins to actually

00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:51,630
check that people hover and clicked on

00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:53,300
different

00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:58,520
yeah

00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:00,170
right okay okay so we're talking about

00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,510
there's a way within Google Analytics

00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,730
you're asking to set up what's called an

00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,980
event and that's a way where if

00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:09,770
something happens on your website it's

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,720
sent to Google Analytics and it's not

00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,430
considered a view of a page it's

00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,470
considered a different category of data

00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,290
called an event and you're asking about

00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:21,140
Google tag manager as it relates to

00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:23,510
tracking events so they are two

00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:27,500
different products so Google tag manager

00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:30,410
is a wonderful product that you can

00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:33,080
think of like a bucket you install tag

00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:35,720
manager on your website and on every

00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,930
page of your website and in that bucket

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,810
serves up all your analytics tracking

00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,850
codes or other things that you want so

00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:46,340
for instance if you're a developer of

00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,990
websites and you install tag manager on

00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,870
your clients sites before you release

00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:53,990
them your clients aren't going into code

00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:56,600
and break-in your site because they want

00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:59,150
to add a new Facebook pixel or a Bing

00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,710
tracking pixel right because they got a

00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,890
goal they have to do is go into tag

00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:08,420
manager and say add this to my bucket

00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:11,450
within tag manager it another Vantage is

00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:15,140
you don't have to add the event tracking

00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:18,890
code within the HTML of the page so no

00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:20,660
one has to break the code in order to

00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:25,460
set up event tracking so it is a

00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:28,970
superior way to do event tracking but

00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,500
yeah it's a different way and so is why

00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:33,530
if you guys are building websites for

00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,360
clients you know you can prevent me from

00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,010
breaking your site when I get it to do

00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,110
the marketing if you just go ahead and

00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,150
install tag manager on it and because

00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,440
you don't want me going into your client

00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,510
sites and breaking it because that's

00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:49,430
just gonna make you hate me and I like

00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:51,890
you even you so Chad did my logo

00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:55,940
recently we have a little argument about

00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:57,860
that I love him so oh yeah events is a

00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,770
great thing to track and you can track

00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,360
all kinds of things as events so if if

00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:05,900
you're producing content for instance

00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,980
and you want people to watch video you

00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,450
can track isn't it

00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,810
van't when someone clicks on the play

00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:14,960
button you set that up as a goal in

00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:18,650
Google Analytics now you know someone

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,359
viewed a video on my site and if it's

00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:23,990
set up as a goal Google Analytics is

00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:25,820
able to tell you guess what so many

00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:27,560
people who visited you from this source

00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:30,770
of traffic viewed the video on your site

00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:33,770
and now you can segment your data and

00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:35,630
you can say hey guess what more people

00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,310
who came from Facebook were more likely

00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:40,340
to click on the video the people who

00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:42,710
came from being right so this is another

00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:45,140
way to track events and doesn't have to

00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:47,290
be a goal I've seen some crazy things

00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:50,119
done with events it's really powerful

00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:54,220
but yeah does that help answer your

00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:58,970
question cool any other questions about

00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:01,310
one more question yes thank you I will

00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,900
have a goodnight way home alright thank

00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:08,389
you guys for coming have a wonderful day

00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,389
