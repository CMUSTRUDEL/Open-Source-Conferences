Description: 
	Did you know there are mini-WordCamps that happen every month all over Atlanta? WordCamp is awesome. From the great topics and happiness bar to meeting new people & catching up with old friends, everyone has a great time. But you don’t have to wait once a year to get this experience! Come meet the organizers of our local WordPress meetups and learn how you can continue your WordCamp experience year-round.
If you’re local and applied to speak, but didn’t get accepted this year — or, if you’re thinking of applying to speak next year — this is where to start.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
place this is the word camp experience

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,420
every month getting involved in the

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,929
local community oh you're the herons in

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,960
the wrong place how many of you have

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,359
been to a local meetup in the Atlanta

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,430
area raise your hand

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,070
awesome how many of you would like to

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,080
come to a WordPress meetup in the local

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,769
area I hope the people that raised their

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,099
hands earlier raise their hands again we

00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:35,989
we want you back so awesome cool well

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,670
this was an idea that Naomi Bush had

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:42,600
because we really you know we always get

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,210
so much feedback from WordCamp

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,920
this is amazing it's exciting and it's

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,170
like you know what we kind of do this

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,870
every month it may be a little bit

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,149
smaller but we do this all the time so

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,969
I'm gonna let Naomi if you'll just kind

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:01,920
of explain what you had in mind and why

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:05,149
you you wanted to do this well who here

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,149
is having an awesome time

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:11,420
and like Brad said that's what we hear

00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,000
you know that word camp is awesome

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,310
you know whether it's the topics or

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,160
meeting up with new friends

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,050
we had a meet-up last month and there

00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,210
were people that were undecided on word

00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,160
camp and as people that have been to

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,410
word camp just started sharing they said

00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,600
well wow you have convinced me and I've

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,100
seen several of them around here and I

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,380
say how is it going and they're like wow

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,560
this is awesome because whether you are

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,690
a beginner or whether you are the most

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,760
advanced developer the one thing about

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:44,060
meetups is that we all get to learn from

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,100
each other all right and so that's that

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,680
was the impetus for this because I think

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,630
meetups or meetups are awesome we get to

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,580
continue this experience every month and

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,200
what I wanted was an opportunity for all

00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,150
of the meetups here in the Atlanta area

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,190
because what you'll find is that each

00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,510
meetup has their own culture all right

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,960
we all do things a little bit

00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:09,979
differently we all tailor things to to

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,010
our particular area and you know I just

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,640
believe that meetups are are a great

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,670
opportunity for you to not only learn

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,500
but for you to get more involved there

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,739
are some people who maybe you want to

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,890
speak write your local meetup is a great

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:31,430
place for the last three months we have

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,930
had we have had two more speakers come

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,760
out of our Meetup and for the last two

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,420
months we've been doing practices

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,160
alright so if you want to kind of get

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,810
your feet wet with speaking and you're

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,840
not sure about maybe the big stage

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:48,950
meetups are great for that another thing

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:54,110
that that I think meetups are are great

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:57,560
for is I lost my train of thought but

00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:00,310
but yeah meetups are awesome and you

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,310
should get involved

00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:06,460
a great idea and she brought the

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,130
organizing team to organize things like

00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,690
wow we had not that that's a great idea

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,240
so we wanted to do a whole session

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,670
around this so the format let me tell

00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,360
you that and I'm just gonna facilitate

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,730
as long as I as y'all let be so but

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,020
basically we've got a we're gonna go

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,010
around and I want to introduce you to

00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,700
everyone they're gonna introduce

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,740
themselves where they meet the time and

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,320
then if there's specifics about that

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,670
meetup like what it's geared to towards

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,110
like there's some that might be a little

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,990
bit more you know hey we do a lot of dev

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,200
talks we do a lot of user talks we do a

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,520
lot of design where we do all of it so

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,750
we'll talk about that a little bit we'll

00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,880
go through and then we've got a few

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,630
questions like how do I become a speaker

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,880
at a meet-up

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,370
what does it mean to be a sponsor at a

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,380
meet-up what does what does that mean so

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,850
we've got some questions and panel and

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,460
then we want questions from you so if

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,220

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,490
attendees here and then afterwards the

00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,650
last part of this all of us will be

00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,270
around the room and it's a great

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,220
opportunity to just do a meet and greet

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,270

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,620

for free all right so we don't sell

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,640

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,350
they don't understand that they're like

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,600
surely you must be selling something but

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,520

know really we only get an hour in our

00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,720
developer meetings and sometimes we want

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,490
to dive into a topic a little bit more

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
we want to learn something together

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:15,060

there's a lot going on in Gwinnett it's

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,830
a lot of time it sounds like a full-time

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,740
job there's a lot going on but remember

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:48,440

people stay longer after the meeting

00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,080
maybe it's because there's a coffee bar

00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:27,510
dropped in the building and this is the

00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,670
third weekend in a row that we've

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,070
actually participated in an event that

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:36,210
has to do with WordPress two weeks ago

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:38,700
we had a pro search at our meetup on a

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,380
Saturday had a great turnout it ended up

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,620
being more of a brainstorming session

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:46,050
this was an effort to support

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:49,530
freelancers in the community who work

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:52,230

our first happiness bar and that was an

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,750
absolute blast it was so much fun

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:05,280

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:49,090
the room there's a projector and

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:52,370
speakers so we can have some detailed

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:54,650
meetings or we can just sit around and

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,630
help each other out some meetings there

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,720
they're really just laid-back is some

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,309

WordPress meetup we meet at the circuit

which is a co-working space business

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,309
incubator and it looks like a gem

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,020
because that's what it used to be used

00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:30,320
to be the gym at Chattahoochee tech in

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:33,140

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,860
can go to brick sometimes I do that

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:47,450
sometimes I just go take a nap

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:50,570
we mostly are business focused so we

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:53,779
want it we do a lot of SEO we do a lot

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:56,929
of content planning really our focus is

00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:59,929
how to take WordPress and make it work

00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:02,059
for your business and how to make it

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:04,010
just more powerful and and bringing

00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:07,419
bleeds and conversions for your business

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:10,519
although we do have resources available

00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:11,929
for users of all levels and so if you

00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:17,269
come early or stay late there's always

00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:20,480
somebody's willing to help hello I'm

00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:23,480
Melanie Adcock I started the Newnan

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,029
Georgia WordPress meetup back in

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:30,649
December we've had a couple meetups so

00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:32,510
far I'm it's proven to finding a place

00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:37,309
after-hours is a little difficult and

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,659
you know because everything closes so it

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,630
looks like we're going to be we're going

00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:45,440
to be doing it at lunchtime on the

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:47,990
fourth Tuesday of every month and we

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,070
didn't have one last month extenuating

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,690
circumstances

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:56,510
so we will meet at the end of this month

00:21:52,690 --> 00:22:01,940
last Tuesday lunchtime just make sure

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:05,149
that you join the noonan group on meetup

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,460
calm and you will get information and

00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:09,830
that's a good reminder meetup comm if

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,559
you join each of these groups you'll get

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,090
notified you'll get an email on who the

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,000
next speaker is and when the next

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,220
meeting is so what I would do

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,070
Atlanta WordPress meetup within 50 miles

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,750

Marietta WordPress meetup since 2011

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,059
[Music]

00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:47,659

00:22:47,659 --> 00:23:05,029
each month from 11:30 to 1 you don't

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,120
have to write all that down on our

WordPress meet what camp Italy on a

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,929

HQ 11:30 to 1 we talk about lots of

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,529
different things the focus of the group

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,620
for me is always on the community of

00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:41,809
WordPress if you've ever met me you know

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:45,820
that I am all about the people and that

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:49,070
is you so sometimes our talks are

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,809
business-related for those of us in the

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,380
business

00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:57,980
sometimes the talks are how - once a

00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:01,190
quarter we have a helpdesk our happiness

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:06,950
bar without fail every single quarter

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:27,909
there is hands-on stuff okay our next

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:30,050
meeting is March the 14th our topic is

00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:33,410
overwhelmed by word camp

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:38,090
[Laughter]

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:49,080
learn how to put at least one item

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:51,480
takeaway very good all right so now so

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,640
so we have some questions here that we

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,770
can ask each other and you know but it's

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,290
more fun if you have questions to ask us

00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,910
so if you have a question we've got we

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,760
have a microphone coming over here and

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,950
over here so just raise your hand and if

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,050
you want to have a want to direct it to

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,340
one individual that's fine if you want

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,380
to just say here's a question then we

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:17,760
can pass the mic around and figure out

00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:20,030
who can answer it hello hello my name is

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,820
Lisa and I come from Northwest Florida

00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:26,010
after a couple of mita are a couple of

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,470
word camps I started the meetup group in

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,210
our local area we had a ton of people at

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,880
first and then we had almost no

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:35,550
volunteers so everybody got really tired

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,920
of hearing what I had to say and we

00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,340
don't have good turnout we have like 600

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,640
members

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:44,540
mm-hmm how do we get speakers anybody

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:54,090
want to visit Destin Florida yes

00:25:44,540 --> 00:26:03,210
seriously I'll speak speak September

00:25:54,090 --> 00:26:04,680
through December frustrated because I

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,580
want them to come but they obviously

00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:10,410
don't want to listen to me so okay April

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,600
so booking speakers is my superpower as

00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,010
anybody who has known me for any amount

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
of time will hear me say at least five

00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,870
times cuz I like to talk about myself a

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,490
lot anyway so I would say what's really

00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,950
important is for the people in your

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,330
community to see what's possible so even

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,360
if you do have to bring people in from

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,100
out of town and this community is

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,590
incredibly generous and we like to

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,660
travel and we love road trips and so I'm

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,410
gonna be going up to Charlotte and I'm

00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,600
gonna be speaking at their

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,190
pretty soon and you know what all she

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,060
had to do was ask me and I'm like yeah

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,730
right

00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,710
so ask there's lots of people here who

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,800
would love to get out and just go and do

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:49,840
something and then your people get to

00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,910
see that that people are actually

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,910
travelling to do this and it makes it

00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,140
more appealing to them and so it kind of

00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:59,250
gives them a model they have to

00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,250
visualize it first

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:12,310
okay so how do you is how do you get

00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:15,040
your meetup involved because you can't

00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:17,440
just have you know bring guests in all

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,330
the time right so I think the biggest

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,890
issue I've seen as people don't

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,380
understand the value that they bring to

00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,820
the community and they feel because they

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,020
don't understand the entirety of

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,470
WordPress that they don't have anything

00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:31,540
to offer and it's really important to

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:34,570
continue to encourage your members

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,510
because as the meetup organizer your job

00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,550
is to help push them forward so like a

00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,650
camps you know making sure that you're

00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,990
introducing them to people because when

00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,490
when you are investing in them they

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,460
become incredibly loyal and want to

00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,630
serve you back and so in making sure

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,190
that they understand no matter where

00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:59,950
they are on their journey they have

00:27:51,190 --> 00:28:02,290
something to contribute back in 2000 I

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:06,310
think it was 2012 when I did my first

00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:08,440
word camp I promised myself that went

00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,690
within a year I would do a presentation

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,070
so I'm gonna challenge everybody out

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:16,690
there to promise yourself that next year

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,690
you're going to do either a meet-up

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,310
or a work camp presentation there's

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,830
there's gonna be one thing that you

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:26,370
learn this year that somebody else needs

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,620
to know you don't need to be an expert

00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:32,920
you just need to be an knowledgeable in

00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,750
one thing that you can share and if you

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,390
promise yourself that you're going to do

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,700
that then start doing the meetups and

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,530
because you can do you can practice I

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,720
mean look at all the practice locations

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,060
you have now that you can do the same

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,560
talk over and over again until you've

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:52,630
got it nailed forward camp next year

00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,100
okay Aaron even if you could do a

00:28:52,630 --> 00:29:01,120
meet-up on

00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:05,290
third or four I know that's narrowing it

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,050
down you're gonna be in Destin then my

00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:10,660
first my first talk that I gave Mickey

00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:12,160
caught me at WordCamp us and he said

00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,960
you're gonna come and talk at my meet-up

00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,730
when we get back and I was like okay and

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,370
haven't showed up since but like

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:26,350
sometimes you really grab somebody and

00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:28,480
say you on this day yes or no yeah other

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,480
ways to get your community involved

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,500
doesn't have to be speaking you can ask

00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:38,560
somebody who is attending to take

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:41,890
attendance you can give them a small

00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,670
task yes so that they begin to feel like

00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:48,190
their presence is honored and welcomed

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:51,100
invited the the trick is to make people

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,120
feel like they belong with this and it's

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,920
not a trick because they do belong there

00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:01,590
it's been my experience that a lot of

00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:04,150
times meetup groups fail to thrive

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,090
either because we become very cliquish

00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:09,520
among ourselves and we don't see the new

00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:12,700
people walking in the room that is my

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,210
superpower I see new people walking in

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,820
the room and it's very easy for me I

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,590
know it's hard for some people but say

00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,710
hello to the person that's sitting on

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,500
your left look up from your laptop and

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:30,910
meet each other and then you begin to

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:34,420
get connected there is a list that I

00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:42,220
could send you of suggestions of how to

00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:44,650
get people in my some thing to that sure

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,510
um so like for a long time I was a

00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:50,440
lurker and eventually showed up at my

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:52,150
first word press Meetup and I just kept

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,370
going to meetups and just kind of

00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:57,610
meeting people eventually because I was

00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:59,710
pretty shy and then I remember going to

00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,180
meet up and Brett this is the Atlanta

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,590
meetup when it was over at General

00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,300
Assembly Brett was like hey I know you

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,190
guys are probably tired of seeing me

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,990
talk but like I want to open it up if

00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,820
you guys want to talk about anything

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,010
then put your name on the list we got

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,660
topics they were like I think you had a

00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,929
list of already topics that you wanted

00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,610
to hear about and and maybe you people

00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,350
would would want to hear so I signed up

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,090
and I was like it was February now it

00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,480
was I signed up for June and I'm like I

00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:27,280
will have the cojones by then to to get

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,929
up on stage and do it and then as it got

00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,280
closer I got scared and I took an improv

00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:37,200
class but but it was because of that

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:40,690
because because Brett asked I was like

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,190
okay and it's like I've been evil I've

00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:45,370
had the good fortune of speaking at many

00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:48,160
of the different meetups in town so and

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,800
and at work him so you know that just

00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,770

people up this is I'm here my interest

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,770
in WordPress is this because I can't get

00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,540

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:19,060

yes yeah cool what else what other

00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:48,159
questions oh yes Jason so staying on the

00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,859
topic of speakers what a speaker

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,079
etiquette and or what what is what do

00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:54,339
you consider speaker etiquette and what

00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,819
are some requirements that you're

00:34:54,339 --> 00:35:01,170
looking for in terms of speakers good

00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:01,170
question name

00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,950
what well in terms of etiquette just the

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,720
one thing I think we've already sort of

00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,980
said this is you're there to help each

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,869
other not to sell

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,390
I had one speaker who I'm pretty sure

00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:18,650
he's in here thankfully they have eight

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,150
slides at the end when they were done

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,980
like all about how great they are their

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,150
company why should you hire them and you

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,320
know I think that can be implied a

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,960
little bit if you speak people are gonna

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,099
know you maybe hire you but it should be

00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,200
implied that best you're really there to

00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:30,710
serve serve the people and yeah help

00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,230
them out

00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,369
anyone else want to talk about that for

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,109
a minute because I think that's an

00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:38,180
important how many of you would like to

00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:42,590
talk at a better word trust me that yes

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:44,000
okay good yeah for us you know okay we

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,560
do you want to address that at all do

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,470
you have I'm put to put you on the spot

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,470
no Aaron anyone Kathy yeah

00:35:53,890 --> 00:36:00,440
for every meet up and for every event at

00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:04,070
a meet up there are five good faith

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:07,340
practices and I cannot quote them off

00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:11,960
the top of my head but the concept

00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:15,589
behind it is what you are presenting is

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,359
for the good of the community it's the

00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:21,010
motivation and then of course you're

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:25,280
being kind and inclusive and caring and

00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:27,890
helpful the topic is not really the

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,700
critical issue when I decide to choose a

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:34,280
speaker I want to know that you are

00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:37,280
engaged and motivated by being a member

00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,310
of the WordPress community and that is

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,070
first and foremost in your in your

00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:45,140
agenda however you might present that

00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:49,640
you remember the five things I don't

00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:52,780
Angela knows can you talk about the five

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,780
items Angela

00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:02,589
a member of the WordPress community

00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:04,869
support team and so we support where

00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:08,349
camps and meetups around the world

00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:11,589
so what Kathy is referring to with the

00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:14,109
five good-faith rules is if you are a

00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:17,890
meet-up that's a part of the WordPress

00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:20,739
chapter meetup program we do a number of

00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,690
things to help support your meetup if

00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:25,210
you're not a part of the chapter program

00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:27,220
that's totally fine but being a part of

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,200
the chapter program means that you have

00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,499
heard about and you agree to the five

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,950
good-faith rules so in quick summary the

00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:38,650
five good-faith rules are first and

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,119
foremost as Kathy said they are for the

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,630
good of the community not for any

00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,859
specific businesses or people number two

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,089
oh boy

00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:56,410
they're really putting me on the spot

00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:59,109
here while I was yakking okay so I need

00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,829
ups are inclusive and available to

00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,190
everyone

00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:06,239
so one benefit of all captor meetup

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:09,789
programs is that they are free to attend

00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:16,450
for meetups in the chapter program they

00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:18,759
adhere to all the so it's speakers

00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,799
specifically for speakers and organizers

00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:23,769
and all volunteers they do need to

00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:27,400
adhere to the GPL at the general public

00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:30,519
license and respect the trademark of the

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:34,559
WordPress logo as well fourth is that

00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:38,619
anybody can organize so even if you are

00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:42,160
you can be anybody as long as you agree

00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:43,630
to the 5k rules so even if you're not an

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,900
expert if you don't think you're an

00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:50,529
expert but you want to build your local

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:53,019
WordPress community do it get involved

00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:55,589
in your local community if there is one

00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:58,749
already if there isn't you can start one

00:38:55,589 --> 00:39:01,719
and the last is that WordPress

00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:05,289
communities are very inclusive they

00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:08,499
should be so any like racist homophobic

00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:12,020
bigoted inappropriate behavior should be

00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:22,130
addressed immediately I get all five

00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:24,280
I think I got all five you know we it's

00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,510
usually a 30 to 40 minute presentation

00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,920
that we're looking for and there's

00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,990
usually some structure behind it

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,680
sometimes we sit around just have kind

00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:35,420
of a discussion but it's good helpful to

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,460
have slides very similar to what

00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,830
everyone's doing here and then you have

00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,920
a Q&A so you know know what you're gonna

00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,820
talk about but it doesn't have to be a

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,920
award-winning presentation just

00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,720
something that stimulates discussion and

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,940
that's something that is different among

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,060
these as well remember that a lunchtime

00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,740
meet up the 11:30 to 1 o'clock you're

00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,050
trying to be respectful of people's time

00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,900
they're taking their lunch hour to come

00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:03,260
to the meetup so it's kind of to the

00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:05,090
point usually it may not be quite as

00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,760
discussion oriented although some are

00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:09,890
but some are very laid-back where you're

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,520
just kind of talking and it's a little

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:31,940
bit different

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:37,970
dianna that's a great way to do a

00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:40,880
first-time talk is a panel so one thing

00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,200
then also it sort of been assumed I

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,119
think by a lot of people here but just

00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,100
so that you do know is if you are a

00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,340
member of the WordPress chapter program

00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,990
they are paying the fees for meetup

00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,359
you're basically on their account so

00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:56,630
then you don't have to pony up the money

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,960
for the for the month monthly fee to to

00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,960
meet up

00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:22,869
all right we've got a question here yeah

00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:24,940
what what next next Sheila people who

00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:29,010
are starting meetups for the first time

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:33,280
that when someone comes to your page and

00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:36,700
visits your page me UPS incorporated or

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:41,290
doctor whatever consider some a member

00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:44,890
and so I sent Oh I started to meet up

00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:48,130
for a keto for nutritional ketosis and I

00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:50,920
had lots of people that just visited and

00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:53,980
so I sent him all a welcome letter and

00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,720
everything and luckily one of the people

00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,780
got back to me and let me know she also

00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,500
has a meet up and she let me know that

00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:05,260
just by nature and then visiting that

00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,109
they are assigned to be a member so

00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:10,359
don't get discouraged if you have like

00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:13,180
fifty members and then no one shows up

00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:22,960
or RSVPs or something because sometimes

00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:25,079
that's meetups not you yep Sheila hi

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,869
everybody my name is Sheila and I'm from

00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,910
Seattle I put onward kept there twice

00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:33,849
and I lead a monthly meetup that's for

00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:36,700
freelancers and I first of all I want to

00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:38,109
applaud that you have so many and this

00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,339
is a great idea we're gonna steal it for

00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:43,480
our camp you guys are awesome and I

00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:45,910
loved what Cathy had to say about

00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,530
community that's kind of my way to is

00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:51,040
it's all about building the community

00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:52,480
and I have so many different things I

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,880
could say I don't wanna hog this but

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,450
what I stood up to say was that since

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,920
getting speakers is such a challenge and

00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:01,690
we hear that in Seattle still when we

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,020
have a lot of meetup groups that are

00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:07,750
very successful the freelancer meetup I

00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,760
run monthly we don't have speakers in

00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,770
fact we after

00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,300
years we just had our first speaker we

00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,610
sit in a circle and introduce ourselves

00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,930
and we have the either the end of the

00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,310
year or the beginner year we do what's

00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:19,260
called lean coffee but it's just a

00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:21,600
brainstorming technique for topics and

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,300
then we set our topics for the year and

00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,880
we announce our topics but the group has

00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,890
a lot of wisdom within it yeah and we we

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,840
first do our introductions and we have

00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,040
we have an agenda that's consistent

00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,780
throughout all our meet ups with the

00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,330
code of conduct and the the five

00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,040
principles and stuff and then then we

00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,990
talk about the topic and everybody

00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,270
shares resources and for this particular

00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,980
meetup we say it's not about plug-ins

00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,930
and themes it's about people who are

00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,610
making their living using WordPress it

00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:50,040
was very targeted and it's also

00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,570
interesting to hear I guess I don't know

00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,100
that geography here it's my first time

00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,840
in Georgia but I guess you're really

00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,570
really spread out to have all these

00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,610
different geographic meetups so in

00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,890
greater Seattle our meetups arts so

00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:04,080
geographic they're specific so we have a

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,000
do-it-yourself meetup for bloggers and

00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,280
people who just do their own website

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,690
they're not professionals and then we

00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,030
have this freelancer one and then we

00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,770
have a help desk one we have specialized

00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:15,930
meetups as opposed to a specialized

00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:18,510
geography that I'm just in awe of what

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:22,910
you guys are doing so for volunteering

00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,910
and building this community yes awesome

00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:34,740
earlier even if you don't have a

00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:37,860
happiness bar your meetups how often do

00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:39,080
you have not official support but if

00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:42,890
somebody comes with a question

00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:46,680
somebody's gonna leave with an answer I

00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,340
would think always at every meeting yeah

00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,620
excellent

00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,780
yeah every meeting and that's something

00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:54,390
we all encourage if you've got something

00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,950
bring it that's the perfect time but

00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,510
maybe not an answer but at least a

00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:02,070
resource where they can find the answers

00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:04,280
right yeah you know so I run the Houston

00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:10,920
meetups in

00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:12,840
[Laughter]

00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,150
and so I'm just curious I know that you

00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:18,510
guys and how many of y'all have run your

00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,940
own meetups we have one a month and I'm

00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,830
wondering you know certain number of

00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,120
groups people come in they're kind of

00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,040
mixed I'm wondering if it would be good

00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,710
to kind of have the idea of splitting it

00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,870
off so I have one a month we have two

00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,900
others one a month one a month so three

00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:35,730
a month different locations but I've

00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,490
thought about having another meet up

00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:41,480
just for either just beginners or just

00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:44,790
developers or because you have to write

00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:48,030
April we do two a month but it's the

00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:50,100
same meter oh it's the same okay I just

00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:52,320
curious if y'all do more than one of

00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:55,550
mine for different naomi's is probably

00:45:52,320 --> 00:46:02,070
the most distributed like you want to

00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:05,280
multiple a month it's the second-largest

00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:09,000
County here in Georgia so we do have a

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,820
pretty wide area and we also have it

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,620
where some people can only make you know

00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,480
some days aren't good for them sometimes

00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,300
aren't good for them and so that's why

00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,190
we started branching out we started with

00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,980
the developer meet up with them and then

00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,720
we said okay you know we want to help

00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,030
out those that are beginners so we built

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,640
up a core of developers first that could

00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:31,470
then run our help sessions that we do

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,120
every month and then our help session

00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:36,480
became so popular that now we do

00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,920
multiple help sessions each month at

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,450
different times on different days

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,550
because some people just couldn't make

00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:43,290
one of the days and then from there from

00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,050
our developer Meetup we got people that

00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,970
you know we had things

00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,950
Wow this topic is really good we wish we

00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:51,900
had more time and so I say well look

00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:54,270
does anybody want to you know start

00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,790
practicing this stuff come together and

00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:58,830
work and that's how our hack days got

00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:01,290
started and so it just really you know

00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:04,590
just came out of me and because we do

00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:07,440
have and then you know traffic you know

00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:10,170
traffic is it's just a bear and so

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,090
that's why it's like okay now let's

00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,740
let's try to you know meet people where

00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,150
they are and we can go to the different

00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,580
cities and just try to help people as

00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,350
much as we can that's our that's our

00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,630
