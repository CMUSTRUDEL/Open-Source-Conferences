	Did you know there are mini-WordCamps that happen every month all over Atlanta? WordCamp is awesome. From the great topics and happiness bar to meeting new people & catching up with old friends, everyone has a great time. But you don’t have to wait once a year to get this experience! Come meet the organizers of our local WordPress meetups and learn how you can continue your WordCamp experience year-round.
