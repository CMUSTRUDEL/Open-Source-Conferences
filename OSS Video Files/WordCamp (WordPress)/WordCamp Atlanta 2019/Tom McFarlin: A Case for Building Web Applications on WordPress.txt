Title: Tom McFarlin: A Case for Building Web Applications on WordPress
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	I’ll provide an explanation for why WordPress is a great option for a  foundation. First, I’ll talk about what a web application is. Then, I’ll cover the difference between a foundation and a framework. I’ll cover how it relates to WordPress (and what we can use out-of-the-box), what we may need to develop on our own, common practices for building such applications, and what a basic project may look like. Some very, very basic object-oriented practices for approaching a project is a help, but not necessary.
