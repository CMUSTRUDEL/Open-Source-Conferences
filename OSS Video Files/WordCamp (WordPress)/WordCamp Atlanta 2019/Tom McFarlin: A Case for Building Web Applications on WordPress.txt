Title: Tom McFarlin: A Case for Building Web Applications on WordPress
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	I’ll provide an explanation for why WordPress is a great option for a  foundation. First, I’ll talk about what a web application is. Then, I’ll cover the difference between a foundation and a framework. I’ll cover how it relates to WordPress (and what we can use out-of-the-box), what we may need to develop on our own, common practices for building such applications, and what a basic project may look like. Some very, very basic object-oriented practices for approaching a project is a help, but not necessary.

all right good morning everybody first

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,519
thank you for hanging out and coming to

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,800
this session as you can see it is called

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,320
a case for building web applications

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,320
with WordPress and I'm gonna completely

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,420
dive into this more in just a moment but

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,990
first I always like to start off with an

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,240
introduction the least where the the

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,670
least of read the least of reasons is

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,210
that why would you want to come to a

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,309
talk to listen to someone who isn't

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,079
invested interested or has experience

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,420
with the topic but I've been building

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,809
web applications on WordPress for a few

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,140
years now and it is something that I see

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:47,129
you know with WordPress being 15 years

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,930
old older than that the next iteration

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,149
the next level of development that we're

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,329
gonna be able to see on WordPress I

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,520
believe is gonna be building software on

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,670
top of it and when I refer to on top of

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,100
it versus beside it versus other other

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,210
ways of centering WordPress as the

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,460
centerpiece we're gonna dive into that

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,799
but before we get started I want to tell

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,330
each of you a little bit about myself

00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,220
but professionally personally things

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,360
like that so first off professionally I

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,930
am a senior vacuum developer for web dev

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,990
studios I also moonlight or freelance or

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,640
whatever you want to call it as for

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,590
press where LLC which is my own business

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
where I build custom applications and

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,360
plug-ins for small businesses and

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,090
individuals for eight years are in press

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,579
where and then this year I started at

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,920
web dev studios so it was it's been a

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,799
really really interesting experience

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,720
really great experience and with press

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,579
where I wouldn't focus primarily on

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,070
small businesses and individuals like I

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,399
like web dev I am working at the

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,969
enterprise level with WordPress now

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,270
I also blog regularly used to it was

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,070
daily then it moved to occasionally

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,439
Darin throughout the week so I try to

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,869
blog about three times a week I also

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,860
this year started doing a little bit of

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,629
podcasting it is focused it's more of an

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,260
extension of my blog where people can

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,110
submit questions and on

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,420
miss Lee or not and then I will answer

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,239
them and then I also fulfill I also

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,159
provide some other information around

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
the questions and I try to keep this

00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,220
short like 20 minutes because so many

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,319
podcasts like right now broadcasting I

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,790
know there's all the rage but and that's

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,530
I think that it that's a good thing but

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,030
with podcasting twenty minutes sometimes

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,440
you're just gonna be running to the

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,560
store you're gonna be out for a walk you

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:45,549
don't need a 60 minute podcast but maybe

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:47,500
20 minutes now the too long didn't read

00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:49,840
of how I got the TLDR of how I got into

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,180
WordPress back in 2005 I started

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,879
blogging when I was in school here in

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,560
Atlanta at Georgia Tech I was running I

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,629
don't even remember which a version of

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,489
WordPress that it was and a kubrick was

00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,810
the default theme it was stuff a default

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:06,690
theme for several iterations of

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:09,129
WordPress and then as I got into the

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,540
after college and started working in the

00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,970
software development field I was

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,170
blogging about my experiences sharing

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,250
what I was learning things like that

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,139
that's something that I still do to this

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,400
day

00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,849
but when it comes to WordPress

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,910
development I was getting my first time

00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:28,150
ever actually modifying anything related

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:30,579
to WordPress core was messing around on

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,569
the template file changing some PHP more

00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:37,269
than one of the files

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:41,079
fast forward a decade and the the amount

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:43,660
of work I was doing on WordPress was had

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,730
just ballooned I had gone from dotnet

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,799
and Ruby on Rails then from Ruby on

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,340
Rails and to WordPress and then

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,780
exclusively into WordPress and then

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,900
lastly I have been speaking at word

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,150
camps and various meetups war camps

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,220
across the country for a few years I

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,230
took last year off of all speaking but

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,690
yeah I've spoke I've spoken in a number

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,549
of different word camps and different

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,500
meetups now one thing if you happen to

00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,970
hear me speak before you know that one

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,729
of the things I like to do during my

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,709
talks is to make it more conversational

00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,150
like I like to have people ask questions

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,650
in the middle of the presentations and

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,329
things like that but this one's gonna be

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,180
a little bit different I'd like to get

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,610
through all of the information and then

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,610
have time ample time at the end for

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,330
questions comments etc so if you have a

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,470
question

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,880
and there's gonna be a good bit of

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,979
information at the tail and if you have

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,690
a question jot it down happy to answer

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:37,030
it but I want to make sure I get through

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,690
everything before stopping in and

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,979
answering questions and things like that

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,400
personally I'm married to my high school

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:48,940
sweetheart we celebrated our 11 years of

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,030
marriage last month we have three kids

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,520
two of which are well one is seven one

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,410
is five and one is she'll be born in

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,080
September so we're really looking

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,310
forward to that I have two dogs that

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,620
we've had since we were married for

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,060
three months they're our siblings are

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,340
awesome and then we have two cats which

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,729
that was not my choice I was outvoted by

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,759
the women in my house so in the dogs

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,949
they deal with them and you know they're

00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,160
good kids but I'm not I tell people I'm

00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:21,880
not a cat person I am I'm that these

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,400
cats person but that's it as far as

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,659
interest I am into music in fact for a

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,970
while thought I was gonna do music as a

00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:30,370
career then you realize man that's

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,840
that's a hard career and probably not

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,520
gonna make a stable living doing that

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
and if you want to get married of your

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,150
highschool sweetheart that's also

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,190
probably not a field in which you should

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,919
go in so anyway I didn't do music but I

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,389
still I have played guitar since I was

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,070
in seventh grade dabbled with various

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:48,460
instruments things like that I also very

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,139
much into fitness and by fitness I am

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,669
NOT someone that you're likely to see at

00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:56,949
a gym lifting weights or anything like

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,539
that but I love running high intensity

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,789
interval workouts things like that

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:02,770
parkour I'm kidding I don't jump off

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:05,169
buildings I and then like the rest of

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,630
you I enjoy reading I like movies if I

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,659
had to pick a genre are science fiction

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,669
fantasy I can't pick one genre but there

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,780
you go and and more I don't know I don't

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:17,380
know what other things constitute

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:21,610
interests but but that's me in a

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,050
nutshell so about this talk unlike many

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,639
of the talks that I've given before no

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,780
code is going to be shown during this

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:32,020
talk it's all going to be discussed at a

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,940
high level and we are going to be

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,620
talking about software development so if

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,180
you have experience with any kind of

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,800
development get software be it web

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,590
development being writing any kind of

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,270
code that's helpful but not necessary

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,770
then as I mentioned earlier please hold

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,410
the questions and comments till the end

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:51,630
unless it's like an absolute emergency

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:54,970
and then I will answer you

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,980
okay so building web applications with

00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,700
WordPress what does that statement mean

00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,720
and the idea is that I want us as

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,270
WordPress developers and those involved

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,980
in the WordPress economy to start

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,680
thinking about using WordPress as a

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,680
foundation for WordPress or for web

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,460
applications but I'm very particular

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,560
about the word foundation so before I

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,260
explain why I want to make sure that I'm

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,940
clear as to why this is a case because

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,200
sometimes when I talk to people about

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,290
this they're like so you should

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,360
completely just forget about laravel or

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,040
rails or dotnet and just exclusively use

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,790
WordPress and that is not what I'm

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,980
saying at all

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,340
I am saying that when it comes to

00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,950
building web applications don't dismiss

00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,290
what you already have or what you're

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,550
already familiar with because some of

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,760
the things that can be built with

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,130
laravel and with Ruby on Rails and with

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,170
other Symphony with other frameworks can

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,490
be done with WordPress there are

00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,880
differences and we'll get into that

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,200
however I think it's important to when

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,480
you sit down for a project or you have

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,120
an idea don't just throw everything away

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,560
say can I do this with WordPress and

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,320
that's one of the things I want to make

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,510
an argument for today secondly as

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,310
developers it's incredibly easy to get

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,840
distracted with new utilities frameworks

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,400
libraries technologies whatever it is

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,110
that comes out but one of the things

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,420
that I've learned in over a decade of

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,840
doing this is that sometimes the new

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:23,170
shiny thing today is gonna be just

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,350
completely scrapped in six months and so

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,000
people like look at for example jQuery

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,530
how many of you in here familiar with

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,090
jQuery you don't even have to use okay

00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:36,820
awesome so I am a fan of a lot of the

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,990
new constructs that are coming in new

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,240
versions of the latest version of

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,550
JavaScript but that doesn't mean I

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,710
completely dismiss jQuery jQuery is a

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,870
decade old it has been hammered on it is

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,360
used on a wide variety of sites

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,670
applications etc if there is going to be

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,220
a bug found in jQuery it's gonna be a

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,480
pretty weird bug because so many

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,810
developers have used

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,540
that the chance that this bug has not

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:04,060
been solved is either you're actually

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,510
doing something wrong or that the bug is

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,130
not a bug at all it's something that uh

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,930
or yeah it's something you're doing

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,570
something wrong or if it is a bug then

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,010
you can report it and it'll be fixed but

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,040
the longer software exists the more

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,750
hammered people are on it are the more

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,290
they hammer on it

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,600
then the more tried-and-true and stable

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,390
it becomes and the same thing can be

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,850
said of WordPress so with that why not

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,670
look at WordPress and that is the whole

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:36,760
idea behind a case for using WordPress

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,530
for web application development it's not

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,690
the case for using it's a case for using

00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,810
it so first like I said it is a

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:47,560
foundation it's not a framework now and

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:50,050
here's why I am very particular about

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,390
this phrase frameworks out-of-the-box

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,400
don't offer any functionality you don't

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,640
sit down and install laravel on your

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,920
machine and say okay I'm ready to go

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,240
I have a user authentication system set

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,620
up I can fire it up in the browser and

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,060
get ready to run I don't have session

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,680
management you may have all of the

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,300
libraries and the functionality that's

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,100
needed but you don't have a fully

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,600
functional application you have the

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,940
scaffolding that you need the same can

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,690
be said of with Ruby on Rails you have

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,340
all of the to use yesterday Carl

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,460
Alexander had a really good talk about

00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,400
object oriented programming in WordPress

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,720
and he talked about how he drew an

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,580
analogy with Legos and the LEGO Group

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,440
and Lego blocks and things like that

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,230
well frameworks provide the blocks

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,940
whereas you're the LEGO Group and the

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,700
thing with WordPress is out of the box

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,040
you have a fully fledged application you

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,140
don't have to write any code you install

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,120
it and then you can start using it to

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,220
write a blog you can start using it to

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,830
build a website you start using it to do

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,280
any number of things but the thing about

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,950
WordPress is that it offers api's that

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,900
allow us to extend the application and

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,940
when you think well when I think of

00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,560
extension I think of like a parent-child

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,240
relationship where I'm going to extend

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,390
WordPress down here to do other things

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,040
but that's not necessarily the case and

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,140
I'm gonna be talking about that a little

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,250
bit more but this is why WordPress is a

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,870
foundation

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,450
it's a piece of software that already

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,310
works out of the box frameworks don't do

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,300
that you have to assemble things in

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,380
order for it to have functionality

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,180
before we dived in a little bit to that

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,420
I want to do a entire history of web

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,100
development I'm not kidding I want to do

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,210
an abbreviated history of it

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:34,900
so websites and web apps what are the

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,670
difference if you get on the web and you

00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,840
browse the number of different or you

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,520
just start browsing around you're gonna

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,950
end up on landing pages you're gonna end

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,000
up on what we often call brochure sites

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,250
you're going to end up on a real estate

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,110
site you will end up on something like

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,960
Facebook or Twitter or social networks

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,820
and things like that but there's a

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,740
difference between say a landing page

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:59,680
and Twitter a landing page is a website

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,940
Twitter is a web application I'm going

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,220
to talk about the differentiation

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,560
between the two but what we've done is

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,350
we've taken the the the colloquial term

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,690
of web site and mixed it with the

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,030
technical term of web app so everything

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,380
is a web site hey go to the have you

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,050
been to this new web site and the

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,120
Facebook have you been to you know back

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,180
when it was called whoa 2003 have you

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,330
been to go to the go to go to go to

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,520
Twitter's web site well technically

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:31,840
Twitter is a web app but nobody walks

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,400
around saying um you mean web app web

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,960
site nobody does that you just say web

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,920
site and then you go and you go to the

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,140
web site

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,940
so we've mixed those but for the

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,500
purposes of this talk I want to separate

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,490
the two we're gonna there's there's web

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:50,470
sites and there's web apps

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:51,790
so first what are sites a web site in is

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,970
as far as I'm concerned is the

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,970
presentation of information it is

00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,040
described with markup that being HTML or

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,070
it might even just be styled with markup

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,110
if it's a really boring web site it may

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,300
also be styled with custom style sheets

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,220
or CSS and I don't even want to talk

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,080
about the direction that CSS has gone

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,060
with less and sass and things like that

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,910
that's that's tangential to this but

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,790
it's markup it is data described with

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,440
markup and it's also you may see some

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,060
behavior on the page manage with

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,050
JavaScript and I'll give an example of

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,420
this a little bit later and

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,459
talk but it's completely static so if we

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:31,420
were to distill this down into a single

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:37,420
statement a website is the presentation

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:39,820
of fixed information and if you are used

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,380
to like highly technical terms with

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,019
respect to software development all of

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,450
you in this room are smart people so you

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:51,519
could also say it's presentation of

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:53,050
static information now this continue

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,329
this this there's a there's a second

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,940
question involved in this and that is

00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:03,209
what is a web application or what is a

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:06,029
web app this is where you have a

00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:09,730
something that runs in your browser it

00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:10,390
responds to user input it processes user

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,890
input

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,240
perhaps it deals with session

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,410
information as a person's moving

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,000
throughout the site and viewing the

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,980
different screens of your application or

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,720
viewing parts of a screen of an

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,600
application you have to deal with

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,040
security that's something that Facebook

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,230
doesn't do very well but anyway yeah you

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,870
have to deal with security you have to

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,060
deal with valid data validation you have

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,560
to deal with cross-site scripting there

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,540
are so many different things that you

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,089
have to take into account when dealing

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,390
with data on a website or in a web

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:45,370
application that it is so much deeper

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,470
than the presentation of fixed

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,060
information but if that's what a website

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:53,290
is a presentation of fixed information

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:56,950
how can we distill a web application how

00:14:53,290 --> 00:15:00,130
about it's a solution that we apply to a

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:04,480
problem you know application door

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:08,110
derivative of apply and that is exactly

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,430
what or exactly how I want to position a

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,579
web app in this for the rest of this

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:16,390
talk so how can we easily define the

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:20,670
difference anything that presents data

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:22,779
and that's all that it does is a website

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,269
anything that transmits information

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:28,360
saves it and retrieves it is an

00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:30,399
application yes you could make a little

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,640
bit of nuanced arguments in each of

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,940
these but that's the general case

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,200
anything that presents data is a site

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,820
anything that transmits information

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,280
saves it and retrieves it is an

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,400
application and data encapsulate a lot

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:48,030
of information so let's talk about

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,270
architecture how a web application is

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,670
built on WordPress so when it comes to

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,050
building applications we often are when

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,940
it comes to building web applications

00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,410
with frameworks we think of scaffolding

00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,730
much like we do with with buildings

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,360
that's you know where the idea comes

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:06,780
from just more conceptual or digital

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,120
versus analog but before we talk about

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,970
software architecture or web application

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,480
architecture I want to talk again about

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,580
sites and here is how normally the

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,790
architecture of a site works something

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,040
like this at a high level or at a basic

00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,350
level you have a site that's made up of

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,320
multiple pages the pages are made up of

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,940
data the data is described by markup and

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,810
then the pages are linked together

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,510
through anchors or you know your a tags

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:39,390
in your in your in your markup that's

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:42,480
how our sites put together now

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,800
applications first part they're written

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:50,460
in more than then HTML and/or CSS and or

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,630
JavaScript they deal with they some

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,100
sites can be built with functional

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,320
programming there's procedural

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,700
programming there's object in your

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,880
object-oriented programming the latter

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,860
two are the ones that you are most

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,040
likely to see in WordPress in fact I

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,330
would say that most of those most of us

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,860
who are involved in WordPress are most

00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,380
likely to see a procedural programming

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,910
in WordPress

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,700
I'm a fan of object-oriented programming

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,030
and this is something that I write a lot

00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,590
about it's not easy in WordPress but or

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,430
it's not as easy as it is another and

00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:24,600
other frameworks but I digress so the

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,950
latter two are the most common in

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,480
WordPress and just keep that in the back

00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,560
of your mind as we're talking about this

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,380
again there's no code in this

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,240
presentation there's nothing to to jot

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,050
down those semicolons or braces or

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,960
parentheses but furthermore applications

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,540
can be divided even even more there's

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,120
the front end and that is in general

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,610
what the user sees there's the backend

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,410
that's where the data is stored there is

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,750
an application layer that sits in

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,920
between

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,380
in the front and in the back end and

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,300
that's where data when a user sends

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,070
information to from the front end to the

00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,840
back end something in the middle has to

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,300
handle that information now how it

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,290
handles it it's not I'm not gonna talk

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,730
about that right now

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,290
but then it also has to retrieve

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,600
information let's say a user requests

00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,610
information in a web application you

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,410
want to get on a site and see someone's

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,120
profile information you're gonna have to

00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,430
you're gonna send a request to the

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,960
server hey tell me about this person

00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,720
so those out grabs the information since

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,700
it back to you and presents it to you

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,220
application layer is responsible for

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,160
doing that so the architecture between

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:31,270
applications and sites are significantly

00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,460
different but it always helps in my

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:36,730
opinion to have practical or tangible

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,170
examples and another way of thinking

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,640
about this or another way that I was

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,350
trying to describe this or come up with

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,480
a short way to describe it is you know

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:49,000
it's easy to talk about this but what if

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,920
I was to demonstrate it so one of the

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,440
things I did when I was doing some

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,120
research preparing for this talk the

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,010
thing about web applications is that the

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,930
idea of application sounds really big

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,370
and I know that almost sounds

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,280
counterintuitive because we're so used

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,740
to apps on our phones these days apps

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,360
are just an icon that you press and then

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,250
stuff comes up and once this stuff comes

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,230
up you're in the app and you kind of

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,610
stop thinking about all of the things

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,410
that make it up because you're immersed

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,150
in what the application is doing the

00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,440
problem that it's solving or how it's

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,700
helping you do whatever it is you need

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,550
to do but a application seems to carry

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,050
the implication that it's a huge piece

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,870
of software that's not always the case

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,910
though but when I was reading about you

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,350
know how people define describe and talk

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,360
about applications on the web I kept

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,970
coming across the idea that it was just

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,140
like this large thing and that's not

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,500
always the case you can have really

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:43,990
simple small applications so also keep

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:48,370
that in mind you can build very small

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:50,050
very focused web applications like I

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,700
said it's it's not always the case and

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,110
then over the next the remainder of this

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:57,490
talk I'm going to give an example as to

00:19:53,110 --> 00:20:00,220
how this is true so first I want to talk

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:03,490
about in the context of WordPress a

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,800
simple plugin and how it's not necessary

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,350
an application even though it solves a

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:12,460
problem but then I want to talk about

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:14,110
the idea of a larger plugin and then I

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,890
want to talk about a distributed plugin

00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:20,710
now also have a full appoint up here of

00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,940
an extension of a plugin and this is

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,120
something where if you're familiar with

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,860
software like easy digital downloads or

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,540
are you familiar with that or gravity

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,850
forms or any of those types of plugins

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,890
you can purchase extensions or add-ons

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,260
it's like plugins for plugins basically

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:38,350
but I'm not gonna be talking about that

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,490
but that is another example of a piece

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,809
of software you have software

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,920
interfacing with another piece of

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,660
software that's interfacing with

00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:49,120
WordPress which in and of itself is

00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:52,450
software but plugins so first practical

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,990
examples of plugins the first one very

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,670
simple and normally I wouldn't do this

00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,080
because it sounds self-promotional but

00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,970
the the plugin that I'm going to show

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,580
it's one of mine but it's completely

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,460
free not a lot of people use it and it's

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,809
so simple that I don't mind sharing it

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,490
because I have nothing to gain from

00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:12,370
doing this except for helping to make

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,870
this point or to help make this case so

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,150
I have a small plug in called easier

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,740
excerpts and the idea behind that I

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,809
wrote it back this is before Gutenberg

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,210
was out the plug-in is Gutenberg

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:23,770
compatible however for those of you who

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,440
write a blog are you familiar with the

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,980
excerpt field that's below the editor

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,390
awesome

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,950
okay so easier excerpts is depending on

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,840
your theme or depending how you have

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,580
your site set up when someone is

00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,880
subscribed to your site they will see

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,490
the excerpt show up in their RSS feed or

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,559
in whatever way they consume your

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,380
information and the thing about the

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,270
excerpt field is if you want to have a

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,510
longer excerpt and I consider this to be

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,790
a long excerpt the excerpt field is

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,340
great for two lines but if you want to

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,330
have like a paragraph or two it's not so

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,550
great so you have to a lot of scrolling

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,020
and when I say a lot it's obviously

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,490
related to the size of the egg certain

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,440
field so what easier excerpt field as

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,200
does is this it responds to user input

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,210
you paste data in it dynamically changes

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,150
the text field size or the text area

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,650
size you remove text and it knocks the

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,059
excerpt field back you don't have to do

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,280
anything but the idea is that hey I can

00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,010
see my entire X

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,020
or I see however much is I've put in

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,610
that's it but that's a small plugin

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,000
there's no transmission of information

00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,590
it doesn't save data to the in itself

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,820
does not save data to the WordPress

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,180
database it doesn't retrieve information

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,340
it just responds to user input and it

00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,870
does so via JavaScript so that's a

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,540
plug-in that's not necessarily an

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:46,250
application but I would like to talk

00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:49,320
about a larger plugin excuse me okay so

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:52,440
the four things about what I'm gonna

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,700
break down so I can't go because of the

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,240
nature of the project I can't give

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,460
specific vendor names however that will

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,150
not stop me from breaking it down and

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,240
explaining how it's all put together so

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:09,000
this plugin first it has to had to

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,250
communicate with a third party API it

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,680
had to then read all of the data that

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,290
was provided by the API and parse it and

00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,520
by parsing I just mean it would have to

00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,200
read it ahead to make sure it was well

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,270
formatted anything that was not well

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,180
formatted it would discard that was one

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,380
of the requirements I don't necessarily

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,090
advocate discarding information that

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,950
can't be processed maybe you should let

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,440
your API provider know that something's

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,850
going wrong third it would create custom

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,530
post types taxonomy x' and templates and

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,940
by templates I legitimately mean

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,500
wordpress templates them it would

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,590
present the information that it would be

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,480
pulling from the API but there was also

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,040
another component that was batch

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,330
processing and I'll get into that that

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,550
terminology in just a moment but this is

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,560
what a larger plug-in can do and this in

00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,360
and of itself it's built on top of

00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,500
WordPress but it's doing a lot of work

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,210
that's not related to it it's

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,800
communicating with a third party API

00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:05,100
it's reading information it's parsing

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,560
information and then the for these lat

00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,780
for that especially the third point it

00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,150
is connected to WordPress but if you

00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,290
were to pull that part out you're still

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:18,680
doing application based functionality so

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:22,470
first this largest this larger plugin

00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,880
the api client had to have an api key

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,420
which if you've ever interfaced with

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,710
another third party API

00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,080
maybe something like stripe you have to

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,390
have a consumer key in a consumer secret

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,190
something like that you would need to be

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,929
able to interface or connect to that API

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,510
and you would have to do so by having a

00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:41,519
key or password or whatever term they

00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,470
provided or they provided to you to

00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,090
connect to the API then they give you a

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,710
list of all the different things you can

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,559
do you can request information from it

00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,840
etc and sometimes you can even write

00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,700
information to it in this case I'm

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,080
simply pulling information so then in

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,830
WordPress I would have had in the

00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,260
plug-in a class responsible for going

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,880
out and then wrapping all of the API

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,289
methods that you could then invoke

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,220
within WordPress hey I want to pull this

00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:06,899
information I want to pull that

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,769
information I want to pull this

00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:09,659
information and pull that information

00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:11,700
and then save it to the database and

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:14,159
that's where the reading of the data

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,720
comes in now this is where I've numbered

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,779
these and I've tried to do them in the

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,909
most logical sense possible I might hop

00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:22,470
around a little bit so this you know

00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:25,200
bear with me if you have questions I'm

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,299
happy to answer them at the end once

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,309
you've read a significant amount of data

00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,110
from a third-party data source you have

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:33,330
to do something with it but you're faced

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:36,510
with a problem on your web server it

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:39,630
will time out if you run a process for

00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,039
too long and you may have run into this

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,960
with another plugin you may have run

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,059
into this in your own code I don't know

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,889
and to make that even more challenging

00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,720
different servers have different

00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:50,460
thresholds sometimes they timeout after

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,659
60 seconds sometimes it's a hundred and

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,510
twenty seconds sometimes it's five

00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:56,580
minutes it can be really hard so what

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:59,010
you want to do is have a reasonable time

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,529
and even if possible you want to be able

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,820
to control the full environment in which

00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:05,210
it's running that way you know hey I

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,649
have two minutes to run this process

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,799
that's where a batch processing comes in

00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:13,500
so let's imagine you have in a database

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,970
or maybe if you don't think in terms of

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,830
databases think of like a spreadsheet

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,570
you just have all this all these lines

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,549
and all these lines of data have to be

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,679
processed and then each line there's

00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:25,860
more data that has to be inserted moved

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,179
around in the WordPress database let's

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,029
say that you have thousands of lines

00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,740
well the thing about that is you can't

00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:34,590
process all of that information without

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:38,490
the server timing out so you have to

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,740
batch the work or in a more less formal

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,380
less term you have to chunk the work so

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,640
you take ten records at a time and you

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,150
say okay

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,630
for the next 120 seconds I'm gonna grab

00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:53,490
ten records process them send them into

00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,309
the WordPress database and then move on

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:59,760
to the next one but then you that raises

00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:02,400
another question how do I know once I'm

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,900
done with one job to start the next job

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,900
or once I'm done with one chunk how do I

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:10,110
start the next chunk and that is where a

00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,790
job scheduler comes into place so you

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,500
have to have another piece of software

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,660
another piece of the software that's

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,790
responsible of knowing where you are in

00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:21,059
the batch processor or where you are in

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:24,150
the batch processing so the job says

00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:26,820
okay I'm grabbing ten and now I am

00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:29,490
working don't bother me I will notify

00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,919
you and I am done it processes the

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,480
information it completes it it checks to

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,760
make sure that everything is done and

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,130
then it will send a notification and

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,450
that's where I put notification system

00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,880
down here at the bottom because there's

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,049
it's used in a variety of different ways

00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,270
I'm going to talk a little bit more

00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:47,370
about it in a moment however whenever

00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,169
you are someone who's administering a

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,730
site or running a piece of software

00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,500
you've got to note it you have to

00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,830
provide some type of feedback to the

00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,470
user regardless of if they are a

00:27:54,830 --> 00:28:01,320
administrator or just a basic invasive

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,070
end user of your software so when a job

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,860
is done

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:09,360
you have to notify and say okay I'm

00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:11,429
ready to start with the next job I'm

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,740
ready to process the next set of Records

00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,510
or hey I'm completely done processing it

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,860
there's nothing to do or maybe even you

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,720
have to go out to the server and say is

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,760
there new data that I need to get via

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,400
the API or not and then you have to

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,900
raise notification about it now how you

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,820
implement the notification you know in

00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,679
WordPress we think about the the bars

00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,390
that show up at the admin notices that

00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,970
show up at the top of the dashboard I'm

00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:36,480
not saying that's how you have to do it

00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:37,980
I'm not even in a log file you know if

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,429
you're the main person working on this

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,860
just pay attention to the logs maybe you

00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,870
can do enough maybe you can do a

00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,150
progress bar you know if it's not that

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,700
much information it's not too hard to

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,070
take the total number divided by where

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,840
you are and then show a progress bar but

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,700
on top of that you have to have

00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,410
something that's polling to say hey

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,390
where are we in the process

00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,700
how many records have we processed and

00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,110
WordPress has the heartbeat API and you

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,670
can read about it in the Codex or in the

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,860
developer resources or you can write

00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,830
your own polling mechanism but it will

00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,930
check to see hey where am I do I need to

00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,180
send a notification if yes do so

00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,800
otherwise keep going and then you just

00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,800
repeat this process until the job is

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,320
done and then you have this notification

00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,490
system as I mentioned and it can be it

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,620
can do a number of things the

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,230
notification system is here in this

00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,240
context is very general it can say hey

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,660
I'm starting the next job I'm starting

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,790
the third out of 150 jobs you can say

00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,850
hey I'm completely done you can say hey

00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:40,200
I have a more I've recognized that

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,940
there's something on the third party API

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,950
I've made a request there's information

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,300
we don't have let's go grab it there's

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,350
information on our server that we had

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,300
that side of the day we need to update

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,750
it the notification system can be as

00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:54,570
advanced or as simplistic as you need to

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,370
solve the problem and then finally

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,560
there's the import process and this is

00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,150
the wordpress specific component that i

00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,980
was talking about earlier and that's

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:04,110
this is where you have to decide once

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,780
i've got that data in the database how

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,220
does it need to be presented to the user

00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:11,190
does it need to be a custom post type

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,500
does it need to be a taxonomy does it

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,600
need to be a custom post type stamped or

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,640
tagged or categorized using a custom

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,950
taxonomy can i use pre-existing text on

00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,070
amis there's all of these little nuances

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,140
that you have to think about and i'm not

00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,630
here to be prescriptive and say that oh

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:31,320
you know every time that you import some

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:33,240
new let's say paint color from a vendor

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,190
that you need to have a custom post type

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,740
of paint and then the color is a

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,960
taxonomy I'm not here to make a case for

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,490
which is the best way to categorize your

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,080
information but you do need to think

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,270
about it in terms of how WordPress

00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,230
represents data because ultimately that

00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:50,640
is where it is going to reside so that's

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,380
a that's a large plugin

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,560
I consider that a web application that's

00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,240
built on WordPress and the reason that

00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,620
it's built on WordPress is because you

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,750
could remove WordPress from the

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,450
foundation and replace it with another

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:08,280
system that provides template

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:09,630
data storage and things like that now

00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,000
this is something that's becoming more

00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,190
and more interesting in the WordPress

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,570
economy how many of you in here have

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,800
just heard of the rest api awesome are

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,420
you familiar with the terminology of

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,880
headless WordPress that's another thing

00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,060
that's getting more ok cool so if you're

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,400
familiar with the REST API then you have

00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,260
all you need to know about what is from

00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,370
it what what headless WordPress is all

00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:38,490
about so I have this title an iOS

00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,320
application and here's why I am

00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,090
currently in the process of working with

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,070
two other people one of them is a

00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,320
cardiologist one of them is an iOS

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,990
developer and then there's me who builds

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,940
software on WordPress and the

00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,430
cardiologist has an idea for an

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:57,090
application that he wants to run on iOS

00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:58,470
and so there's going to be software

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,590
obviously that has to run on the phone

00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:05,700
but then there's going to be something

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:07,800
for another party that is that is going

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,810
to need to work in a web browser I'm

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:18,270
going to break down each part of this to

00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:21,480
you so first this is by far the most in

00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,610
my career the most advanced WordPress

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,560
application that I have built and by

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,910
that I mean it's it's advanced and that

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,100
it's distributed among multiple

00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,180
operating systems multiple languages and

00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,560
there's a lot of different little

00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,690
nuances we're having to take into

00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,140
account it's a lot of fun it's a little

00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,330
bit challenging but for the sake of this

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,120
talk

00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:45,420
the cardiologist wants to have the

00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:48,270
patients with the app on their phone now

00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,760
the data that is for the patients is

00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:53,400
unique to them they cannot have access

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:57,990
to other people's information if you're

00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:00,750
familiar with HIPAA you know that well

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:03,990
that about your spots you're very well

00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:05,580
aware of the regulations around that but

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,140
so you have other patients with the data

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,300
that is going to be on their phone and

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,970
then you have things to WordPress the

00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,740
REST API and then the physicians will

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,660
have a web application and physicians

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,290
have multiple patients but a patient

00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:21,000
just has himself or herself now the REST

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:23,720
API is what will allow us to take the

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,740
patient's iOS application and

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,830
communicate with the physicians

00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,960
application so first the iOS application

00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,640
this is gonna sound almost boilerplate

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,130
because this is how so many applications

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,929
are built there has to be user account

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,390
management they have to be able to log

00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:41,160
in so they're gonna need a username this

00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,570
can be something like their email

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,679
address or it can be something else that

00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,809
they want to choose and then there's got

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,030
to be a strong password because that

00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:49,140
matters there needs to be session

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,030
management because as they're moving

00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,400
around in the application we're gonna

00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,500
need to know not only are we going to

00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,260
need to know what information they're

00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,660
entering and when but we're gonna need

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,760
to know if something happens to break we

00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,880
want to log it so that we can keep tabs

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,020
on oh we need to fix this bug or things

00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,909
like that you don't want to throw up an

00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,710
exception message about something to the

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,570
user then especially for people who are

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,800
having heart problems if they see

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,629
something they don't understand that

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,440
might I don't know what that would do to

00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:18,270
their heart

00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,639
so anyway you also want to have data

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:23,000
serialization and by that on the phone

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,050
you want to take the information and

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
save it into a format that you can

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,550
easily send across the proverbial wire

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,250
to the web application and that's what

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,159
the iOS app has to do yes it's at a high

00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:37,169
level but it's relatively boilerplate

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,320
for a lot of applications except it's

00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:43,770
specialized to a specific industry but

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,740
what what applications aren't so then

00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,540
you have the WordPress API now this even

00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,280
though it's powered by WordPress is kind

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,490
of the interstitial part of the

00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,109
application it allows the user to create

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,390
the account and here's one way to think

00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:59,130
about this this is why it's not just a

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,990
matter of hey I have an email address

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,060
and here's my password and I want to set

00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:06,390
up my account let me do it it's not that

00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,820
easy because you have to then say okay a

00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:11,310
person on their phone is signing up then

00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,560
we have to make a hop and say there they

00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,540
hit an endpoint and then that endpoint

00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,180
then has to fire some logic and say okay

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,220
new requests coming in here's an email

00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,130
address is this email address of a valid

00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,630
format if yes does a user with this

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,000
email address already exist in the

00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:30,359
system from there and if you're dealing

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,460
with with hip with security let alone

00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:34,380
HIPPA regulations you got to wonder why

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,609
is somebody trying to sign up with this

00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,830
email address when it's already in the

00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:39,690
system is it just user error or is

00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,210
someone trying to gain access to

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:45,740
their data so that's another thing then

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:51,300
you have to send a response back to the

00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:53,069
iOS application to say this user account

00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,930
already exists and then you have to

00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,890
handle that appropriately or you can

00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,480
create the account and say hey

00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,770
congratulations your sign oh my say

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,690
congratulations it's not like you've

00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,280
achieved some big task but that's what

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,569
all the notifications do right it's like

00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,240
congratulations you've signed up for

00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:08,430
your app good job use your metal but

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,990
anyway you you create your application

00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,270
or you create your account then you're

00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,400
given the app the iOS app will read the

00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,710
status code and says okay you're ready

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,230
to go so then you sign in with your

00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,849
email address and the password and if

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,319
you don't want to send passwords via

00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:24,240
email and I don't think you should send

00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:25,980
password via email instead you can do

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,130
one of the popular things right now are

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,180
magic links slack does this a good bit

00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:33,569
you can also give the user the ability

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,190
to go on to they can hop somewhere in

00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:36,990
the page and set up their own password

00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,690
confirm that it's strong all of that and

00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,609
but the API can still the API that you

00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,950
design can still give you the

00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:45,599
information necessary to say hey this is

00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:48,480
successful or it's not and then respond

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,210
appropriately but then you get into the

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,280
area of saving data and retrieving data

00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:56,970
so let's say that you are using this app

00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:00,960
as a patient and you want to save your

00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:02,609
information to the physicians

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,069
application the physicians application

00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:07,800
is the one that resides in WordPress so

00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:10,829
first you want to serialize information

00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,630
that is safe to have on your phone

00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,420
should you know god forbid your phone

00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,480
ever get lost you want to save it into a

00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:22,109
format like JSON that's easy to send

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,920
across the wire to the server but the

00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:30,210
longer the user uses the app either the

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,180
greater the data is going to be or the

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,200
size of the data is going to be or

00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,119
you're going to have to think of a

00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,800
creative way to say okay the last time

00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,270
we say that the data was this date and

00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,569
time so we're just gonna send the most

00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,890
recent and then it also needs to be able

00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:45,150
to retrieve data if you want a

00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,440
historical account of all the

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,819
information that you've ever entered

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,060
into an application you've got to be

00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:52,320
able to retrieve that from the web

00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,640
application

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,920
and once again we're back to

00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,450
notification systems and the reason I

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,640
mention this is because giving users

00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,580
feedback is so important and you don't

00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,350
want to do it in developer jargon you

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,760
don't want to throw up the result of an

00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,000
exception message you want to give

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,010
something that lets them know hey

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,520
something happened or yes this was

00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,600
successful or the date has been saved or

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,610
another another move that we're often

00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,290
seeing now is that when data is saved

00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,340
it's just saved silently in the

00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,010
background there's not even a Save

00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:25,650
button and I think that's elegant but I

00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:28,860
think it also can confuse some people if

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,570
you've used like Microsoft Word for 20

00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,950
years you're used to command save

00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,720
command save command save command save

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:36,210
and all the sudden now the app is saving

00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,830
your work for you automatically how do I

00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,880
know it I don't trust that when's the

00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,050
last time that I saved it you know

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,840
there's a lot of little things around

00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:45,090
that to consider but then you have the

00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,250
physicians web application now remember

00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,140
we talked about a patient has one

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,570
physician but a physician has many

00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,640
patients so the physicians web

00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,680
application is actually going to be a

00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,360
it's going to be built on WordPress and

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,880
it's going to be designed to run in a

00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,100
web browser either on an iPad or on a

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,660
computer and from there they can see all

00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,860
of their patient information they can

00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,490
see all their patients and then for each

00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:12,900
patient they can drill down and see

00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:14,580
charts records etc and there there's

00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,230
there's notifications built into this

00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,000
part too because if you're a

00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:20,180
cardiologist and one of your patient

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,560
saves information and they have a

00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,150
arbitrary threshold of where a number

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,470
should be or shouldn't be then the

00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:29,250
physician needs to be notified hey

00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:32,250
patient patient zero for those of you

00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:34,050
who are fans of zombie comics or zombie

00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,640
movies patient zero is always the one is

00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:40,680
the one that causes the outbreak but

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,940
anyway whenever patient zero is value

00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,110
goes higher than what it should be or

00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,990
lower than what it should be you need to

00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,520
notify the physician but then you got to

00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,930
decide hey does it notify them just

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,640
during working hours doesn't need to be

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,530
on call you need to have a text

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,000
messaging system built in etc but let's

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,440
just say it's in WordPress and so

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,210
they're in WordPress they're running

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,310
through reports let's say that you opted

00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,750
to use the heartbeat API so every 15

00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,520
seconds it's polling in and says oh

00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,620
patient zero there's a threshold

00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,090
adjustment the they've just saved their

00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,770
data the threshold they're above three

00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:10,800
hold and then they need to take whatever

00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:12,420
action is necessary and then finally you

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,240
want to generate reports you know

00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,670
reporting it can be charts it can be

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,310
just an Excel spreadsheet it can be a

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:24,840
CSV it really depends on how they want

00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:28,110
to see the data represented now the

00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,940
purpose again of this talk was to be it

00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,530
was to was to kind of sit at a high

00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,840
level it wasn't this is why there was no

00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,940
code is to be at a high level to say

00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,300
here are a few different ways that you

00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:42,330
can build software on WordPress and the

00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,670
reason that I wanted to make sure that

00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:47,130
it was presented in this way is because

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:50,190
it's just a case for a while WordPress

00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:53,850
is an option not it's that it's the

00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:58,140
option and so in the talk and this is I

00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:59,730
want to touch on these points because I

00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,530
know that we're holding questions to the

00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,510
end is we went through the product we

00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,860
went through web development well an

00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,870
abbreviated history of web development

00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,640
we talked about the difference in sites

00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,640
and applications even though we've kind

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,190
of mixed those terms together we've

00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,500
talked about simple plugins we've talked

00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,030
about small plugins we talked about

00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,380
add-ons or extensions of plugins we

00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,600
talked about large plugins and we've

00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,850
talked about full scale applications

00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,400
that are distributed between iOS devices

00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:29,310
they're WordPress REST API and WordPress

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,430
and then how this encapsulation entire

00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:35,730
web application but remember like I was

00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:38,550
saying this is still a case for building

00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,260
web applications on WordPress it's not a

00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:42,390
framework WordPress is not a framework

00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,670
you'll see it often times mentioned

00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:47,250
online WordPress is a great framework

00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:49,380
for building web applications WordPress

00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,660
is a great framework for this side it's

00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,520
not a framework it's a foundation if it

00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,080
was a framework it was not it will it

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,820
would not offer it would not be a fully

00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,850
fledged application out of the box and

00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:02,220
it is there but the nice thing about

00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:05,280
WordPress is there are existing powerful

00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:07,230
api's that we can already use to take

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,670
advantage of some of the functionality

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,580
that WordPress offers user

00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,900
authentication session management and

00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,640
couple it with some of the newest

00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,530
features in PHP you can write things in

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,030
an object-oriented manner you can do a

00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,200
lot of filtering validation and

00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,460
retrieval of information

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,079
things like that you can connect to a

00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,559
variety of different data sources that's

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,990
nice

00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,220
but then you can also take for those of

00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,480
you who work in other fields I was

00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,260
talking with a gentleman yesterday who

00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,359
is a dotnet software engineer if you are

00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:38,490
familiar with building software in

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,980
another way net be it rails via PHP via

00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,119
any other of the variety of languages

00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,130
that are out there for building software

00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,190
you can still apply those same

00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,750
techniques to WordPress if you are gonna

00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,839
be responsible for building it for

00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,609
building a object relational map you can

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,010
do that using WordPress as long as you

00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:57,690
understand the database schema or create

00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,099
your own tables and insert that into the

00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:00,869
WordPress database you can do all of

00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,510
that you just have to do it within the

00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,829
context of WordPress and when I say and

00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,510
I and I say that phrase a lot the

00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:07,980
context of WordPress and I say that to

00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,920
drive home the fact that all of this

00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:14,880
does WordPress is the foundation but

00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:18,119
it's extremely extensible and so

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,670
ultimately whenever you have an idea for

00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,650
building a web application and you think

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,020
oh man I would love to build this but I

00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,609
can't do this on WordPress I gotta go

00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,530
learn another framework and I got to go

00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:30,030
attendees workshops and I've got to go

00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,859
read these books and now I don't want to

00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,299
do anything I don't wanna build anything

00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,760
because now I gotta do more work before

00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:39,630
I even get to work but pump the brakes

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,480
on that thought and ask yourself why not

00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:46,470
WordPress what is it that it doesn't

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,079
have that I what does it not have that

00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:51,030
would allow me to build this so with

00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,920
that thank you so much for coming

00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:57,410
I know it's nine o'clock out on the day

00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:00,359
of the after-party so if you're you know

00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,400
hungover or if you are drinking some

00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:04,530
kind of special coffee or I don't know

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,819
what's in your white cups thank you so

00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:08,369
much for coming I really do appreciate

00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:12,000
it I hope that this talk helped to

00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:13,859
expand the ideas or they expand your

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,809
proverbial horizon as to what you can do

00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,549
with WordPress but at this point I am

00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:19,049
completely open to questions comments

00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:21,210
and conversations around this it's

00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:23,400
something that I really enjoy and so

00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,819
with them open the floor for for

00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,819
questions

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,540
okay so the question is how do you learn

00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,849
to do this in WordPress if you've not

00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,730
done it before or if you have experience

00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:21,839
in other fields industries or segments

00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,450
of the industry how do you learn to

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,299
begin bringing this into WordPress

00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:31,049
instead of a fair summary okay so the

00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:34,559
first thing I would recommend Carl I'm

00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:36,359
gonna ask you to this is not a plant can

00:45:34,559 --> 00:46:03,950
you please put can you please plug your

00:45:36,359 --> 00:46:13,490
book with the disc okay

00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:16,310
okay okay yes

00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:25,400
okay in addition to that so his sites at

00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:27,170
carl alexander CA okay okay I like to

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,000
outsource as much information to you

00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,099
we're gonna have questions and y'all are

00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,900
going to answer them no but it's a

00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:34,130
really good resource like and so that's

00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,630
why I wanted to mention that the second

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:40,220
thing is there and this is I guess

00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,510
unapologetically self-promotional I blog

00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,339
about object oriented programming in

00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:47,150
WordPress what did you say you know I do

00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:49,580
oh okay well thank you so I write about

00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,770
things in very small segments but if you

00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,570
here's the best advice I can get I think

00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:56,240
you know udemy and online courses and

00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:58,070
things like that you're gonna find it's

00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,290
gonna be a mixed bag I'll be honest with

00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:03,050
you you're gonna find like that wasn't

00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:29,330
so helpful but or you're gonna say like

00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:32,210
wow that was exactly okay so are you

00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:34,160
familiar with being a self learners such

00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:39,530
is such a great skill to have are you

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:43,640
familiar with Zack Gordon okay he's on

00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:48,140
Twitter at Z Gordon he has courses on a

00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:51,470
variety of different things and I wish I

00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,940
could give you like one place to go to

00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:57,470
learn how to do this but what I would

00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,510
recommend is spend time in the word

00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:01,010
pressed of in the WordPress codex and

00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:04,040
understanding the or learning the

00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:05,690
WordPress api's there's a and just you

00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,700
know look it up on DuckDuckGo or Google

00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:10,970
and say you know WordPress codex or

00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:13,820
WordPress api's and codex and then match

00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:16,430
that with PHP that's going to give you a

00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:18,170
lot of in the rep because then you know

00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:19,880
didn't you have mark you have your html5

00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:21,440
you have your CSS and things like that

00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,359
but that can also be built by a

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,589
front-end designer but if you're if

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,510
you've been working with the databases

00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:29,849
then I will

00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,920
venture to say that you're very server

00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:34,109
minded back in minded things like that

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,420
and so when you start thinking about

00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:38,190
building applications you can probably I

00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,049
would and I'm making a leap here but you

00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,369
would be able to say you'll be able to

00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:42,569
put something together and then display

00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:44,309
it on the screen it may not look pretty

00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:50,460
but you can always bring someone in to

00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:53,789
help it look pretty then I would say in

00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,650
the wordpress developer resources look

00:48:53,789 --> 00:49:00,450
up the available api's and see what it

00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:02,460
does offer it's okay to ask questions on

00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:05,990
Stack Exchange the WordPress Stack

00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:08,609
Exchange comm but be careful like you

00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:10,890
don't just assume every answer you get

00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:41,309
is the best answer but that's with any

00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:48,289
site right good David yeah that's an all

00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:48,289
day right

00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:29,630
the last thing I want to mention before

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,720
I'm doing other questions go to WP

00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:34,160
sessions comm you're gonna find a

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:40,220
variety of different topics there but

00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:42,859
some I'm sorry word sesh yeah but WP

00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,900
sessions first first WP sessions is a

00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:46,490
just a library of people who work

00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,619
exclusively with WordPress they've built

00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:51,079
sites for the wire cutter which is owned

00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:52,730
by the New York Times they've built or

00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:56,599
web apps to do that and then down into

00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:57,319
other smaller niches but then later this

00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:01,640
month

00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:06,349
I'm word sesh which is word sesh which

00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:08,390
is an online conference power or once

00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:10,819
they powered by same person so he's on a

00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:14,150
hamster wheel he's the same guy who runs

00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:17,450
WP sessions Brian Richards he's gonna be

00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,890
doing as an online conference so hope I

00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,119
hope that helps and don't hesitate to

00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:23,950
email me I'm always happy to answer

00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,950
further questions about that too

00:51:33,640 --> 00:52:09,670
there's some so the question is if I'm

00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:13,460
building a web application on WordPress

00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:15,140
is it possible to turn off or to say hey

00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,030
I want to do essentially a feature

00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,640
freeze I don't want to upgrade WordPress

00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:21,490
because where it is right now is

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,920
acceptable for this application is that

00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:27,830
okay so first I would the first thing I

00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:32,060
want to I want to make clear is when you

00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:34,700
turn off the ability to upgrade you do

00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:37,160
run the risk of disabling security

00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,600
updates but if you have control over the

00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,040
environment in which it's in like if

00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:44,480
it's um an intranet or something like

00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:46,820
that then that responsibility is on you

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,610
to handle that but you can turn off

00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:53,180
update notifications you can turn off

00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:55,280
auto updates you can turn off a anything

00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:58,340
that deals with automatically upgrading

00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,470
WordPress you can disable that off top

00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,660
of my head I can't remember all that all

00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:04,730
of the things that proverbial knobs you

00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,920
have twist to do that but if you will

00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:09,220
look up it's in it's all documented in

00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:13,660
the developer resources and the Codex of

00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,660
disabling auto updates

00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:23,840
[Music]

00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,190
it depends because with an upgrade so

00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,780
the question was do I recommend doing

00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:32,690
that and the I'll have to this will be

00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:37,610
my last answer so I don't run into the

00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:39,230
next session but this is one of those

00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:42,260
answers I hate to give but it depends

00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:44,530
and it depends because you do run the

00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:47,360
risk of losing security updates however

00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:50,420
if you also miss out on updates you

00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,040
could gain access to new API s but you

00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,820
may also lose ap is that you're already

00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,590
using and in that clot in that scenario

00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:59,210
you're either task with okay I'm gonna

00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:02,120
run the risk of just leaving things as

00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:03,560
they are or I'm gonna write in

00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,030
object-oriented programming there's a

00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,330
design pattern called the adapter

00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:12,140
pattern and the adapter will take an old

00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:14,750
API and you basically build just like

00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:17,900
when you connect a power let's say an

00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:19,730
American power power cable to something

00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,110
in Europe it's an adapter that sits in

00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,490
between it and then processes the

00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:24,530
information so it says okay the

00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:26,660
information is coming in an old way I'm

00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:29,450
gonna reformat it and then save it in a

00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:32,240
different way so I hope that helps

00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:34,790
that's it's a really good question but

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,470
it's not an easy answer all right thanks

00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:41,270
everyone for for coming

00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:41,270
