Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	Did you know that website structure is good for your visitors and for SEO? We’ll discuss why having a good site structure helps visitors find your content and inform search engines what your content is about. We’ll discuss the how to configure WordPress for optimal site structure, what plugins to use, and the difference between categories and tags.
Attendees will learn about the two different types of site structure, what search engines look for, and most importantly why good site structure is good for usability. We’ll dig into designing permalink structure, slugs, and breakdown taxonomies and when to use them appropriately. This session will help both developers and users understand how to best structure their websites for both visitors and search engines.

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,730
and got extra cookies if you're into

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,379
that thing because I am I got extra

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,060
cookies and I had a hunt for the

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:23,310
chocolate chip but I found one so that's

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,970
good yeah so I I my company's from high

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:31,980
internet and I started put my internet

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:35,270
in 2004 we do SEO SEM and analytics and

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,989
then a bunch of other stuff that help

00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:41,550
businesses rank and sell things online

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:45,120
and I did get my start at Florida State

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,059
it I have a baby face at least that's

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,730
what my mom tells me but I've been doing

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,309
this a while so I started in 1998 which

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,829
is hard to believe that I've been on the

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,149
internet that long and don't have like a

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,500
paper trail and people still want me to

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:04,080
speak so but but my focus really is on

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,150
SEO and SEM and today we're going to

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,680
talk about site structure for SEO so I'm

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,090
single so I'm going to give you a list

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,180
of the things that I like so I like

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,040
technology I like WordPress duh

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,900
I like puns much to my friend chagrin

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,810
and if you laugh at my jokes I will tell

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,600
you more I love RuPaul's Drag Race it's

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,960
one of my favorite TV shows on on TV

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,250
I love improv and I love flan I'm from

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,579
Miami so I eat flan wherever I go and I

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,149
love vinyl records so this is my record

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,040
collection it's sort of ordered you

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,159
can't tell maybe unless you recognize

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,020
those those spines but yeah I have it in

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,350
order alphabetical order but it's a

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,850
little messy you know I'm kind of

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,790
keeping I'm not having enough space for

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:04,520
all the vinyl records that I have but it

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,119
doesn't look like this thankfully this

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,759
right exactly

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:13,390
it looks like some some websites right

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,430
now you got the metaphor so this I

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,780
this would be a beautiful dream of mine

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,520
I would just spend all day looking at

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,569
this stuff and I'm sure that the person

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,130
who owns this collection knows where

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,080
every single piece of vinyl that is in

00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,730
this collection for the most part but if

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,870
anybody else comes to this collection

00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,840
they look at and they're gonna be like

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,640
where do I go like where do I begin

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,740
I don't know do I begin here do I begin

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,840
here that leave with that record cover

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,880
looks pretty nice yeah so there's no

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,310
order to this madness right except for

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,410
the person who owns it and as we know on

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,819
the web we have people coming to the

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,950
sites we're not the only person visiting

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,489
our own website I mean maybe but most

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,850
likely not

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,770
right we're on the internet so we want

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,060
people to come to our website so here's

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,160
an example of organized record

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,170
collection this is by Marc Apple if you

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,850
haven't met him he's over there he

00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,230
showed me this record collection when he

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,120
knew I was giving a talk about that

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,459
includes talking about vinyl records to

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,730
show off his beautiful wood carving

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,920
carved tabs the how he organizes it just

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,110
to show me how I can do it if I ever

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,970
organize my record collection but

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,350
anyways so that's it's a nice looking

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,260
collection right you know holidays

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,500
there's country music I think that's

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,850
soundtracks at the end so you know Marc

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,350
knows where everything is and if any I

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,209
wanted to come in and steal his records

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,079
I can find all the stuff that I want you

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:31,900
know so yeah so what is website

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,700
structure right site structure is how

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,880
the pages are on you on your site or the

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,700
link to one another so why is it

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,950
important to have a good site structure

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,200
it does two things it easily helps

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,690
visitors find the content that's on your

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,480
site and it allows search engines to

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,810
easily find that wonderful content you

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,100
work so hard to create so if we look at

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,530
the different types of site structures

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,160
there are there's about there's two of

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,420
them one is a flat site structure

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,150
usually this is a site structure where

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:07,900
the homepage links to all the content

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:11,140
that's on your site right it's your one

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,970
click away from the home page you're you

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,900
don't have to click so many different

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,100
links in order to get to the content and

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,280
so you find that a lot with like

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,390
brochures sites right or if you're just

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,890
starting out and you only have like a

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,150
handful of pages that you're linking to

00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,860
so you can link all the stuff on the

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,139
home page problem is is that

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,139
it limits the number of pages and the

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,030
problem is is that it it you are once

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:38,979
your site starts to grow then you limit

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,770
yourself as to like how many links you

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,909
can put on your page right so but the

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,669
good thing is is that people can find

00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:48,550
all your stuff easily right if we look

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,639
at deeper site structure there's a

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,969
longer click path that's involved right

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,439
there

00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:55,840
content gets grouped into different

00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,770
types of themes and buckets so like for

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,449
instance we have different categories

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,000
and then other pages that fall into

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:04,210
those categories and you're increasing

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,550
the number of clicks to get people to

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,159
your content however your content ends

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,949
up becoming more organized as a result

00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:16,210
so if we look at the disadvantages of

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:18,159
having a flat site structure you you get

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,840
minimal clicks for the content but your

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,400
content all your content ends up on the

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,469
roof folder so as you start to develop

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,000
your content because you've all attended

00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:26,319
wonderful talks like April's talked when

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,919
she was talking about developing content

00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,050
and having a Content schedule then you

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,000
your website is going to grow and grow

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,909
and you can't really link all those

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,710
pages from the home page because when

00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,569
you when you're when a visitor comes to

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,060
your homepage then you're giving them

00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:45,580
too many options right what's it like so

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,919
you want them to follow a path when they

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,469
come to your site so as your site grows

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:55,029
then having the deeper structure becomes

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:56,409
more important additionally search

00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:58,419
engines have trouble understanding the

00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:02,770
context of the content that that you

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:05,610
have if it's all all off the route so in

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,800
fact John Wheeler who is the the

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,310
webmaster trends analysts at Google and

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,409
hosts this great live stream called

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,610
webmaster sent from webmaster central

00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:18,339
says that if we're only seeing these

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,110
URLs through your sitemap then we don't

00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,589
really know how they're are related to

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,690
one another

00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,370
and so it makes it very hard for Google

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,319
to understand how relevant this piece of

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,990
content is into the context of your

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
website so when you start thinking about

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,469
like say you go to a library for

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,349
instance right you walk into a library

00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:37,959
and you don't see just books scattered

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:40,209
all around right there's a system in

00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,689
place so the top-level system is like

00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,099
fiction

00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:44,379
fiction and then you have like reference

00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:47,469
books right and then even into those

00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:49,389
different sections of the library you

00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:50,919
have different types of books that fall

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:52,389
under it like biographies right if

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,769
you're talking about nonfiction you're

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,259
talking about biographies you're talking

00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:58,559
about historical books they all have

00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:01,059
their place right and within those

00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,489
within those subsections are different

00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:07,149
are different books even within those

00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:10,599
subsections so Google looks at it the

00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:12,039
same way where you are it has a better

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,129
understanding once you start grouping

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:20,919
your content as your site starts to grow

00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:23,019
so it's like a pyramid right so you have

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:24,059
like a hierarchical hierarchical I

00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:25,899
always have trouble with that word

00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:28,329
hierarchical organization of your

00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,769
content so it's like the top level like

00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:33,189
I was saying like fiction nonfiction

00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:37,329
then you have like biographies and it

00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:40,360
all grows comes down off the top just

00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:41,679
like this triforce and and so as you

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,759
start site starts to grow let's say you

00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:44,559
have an e-commerce site you might have

00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,599
even subcategories that fall under each

00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:48,339
of those categories and then you could

00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,909
have pages that are connected to those

00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,679
different different categories so an

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:57,039
example is like product categories on an

00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:59,139
e-commerce site blog topics company

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,849
departments if you're thinking of a new

00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,889
site like different sections of the

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,559
newsroom a tan like the New York Times

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,389
for example they all have they all cover

00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:09,969
different topics right and so their site

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,860
is actually designed in a way that you

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:13,059
can find different topics you can go to

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,269
the different topics and find the

00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:19,629
articles that are part of that topic so

00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:21,939
if we go back and look at at the if we

00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:23,979
look at the deeper site structure this

00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,629
is where it all comes into play where

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:27,639
you have different categories and pages

00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:33,159
that are connected to those categories

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:38,169
so how do we establish hierarchy in

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:40,029
WordPress pages so pages is a great way

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,879
to organize your content into

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:46,029
hierarchies has anybody done that in in

00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:49,509
WordPress before on your pages okay a

00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:51,970
handful of you yeah so and for this

00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,890
example the Georgia voice is a client of

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,930
mine and we organized their pay

00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,579
two different types of topics and so

00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,709
they're covering different organizations

00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,200
that are within the city of Atlanta and

00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,220
so you can see that they have

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
organization that's the top level and

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,700
then they have art organizations

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,279
business organizations health

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:13,410
organizations and then nightlife of

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,490
course as an organization so they're

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:20,050
organizing all their different content

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,550
into buckets the other place where we

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,329
can set hierarchies within categories

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,709
and so when you think about your posts

00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:29,850
all your posts get assigned a category

00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:32,620
right or you can assign them category

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,269
and so even within the categories

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,190
themselves you can set up in a hierarchy

00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:38,290
so that if you have lots of articles

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,670
that are associated with categories you

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,440
can have even you can drill down into

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,079
like for instance culture we drill down

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,970
to art book and books and dance alright

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,940
so how many of y'all are using

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,920
categories for your posts how many of

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:55,600
you are have zero posts assigned to

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,950
Uncategorized you guys are awesome how

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
many do have posts assigned to

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:03,010
Uncategorized it's okay I won't shame

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,660
you yeah so like think of when you start

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,160
thinking about your posts and writing

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,930
your posts for your for your for your

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,370
blog for instance here's where you can

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,990
assign these different categories so

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,930
that you start putting the logical

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,839
structure where your content is this is

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,339
associated with a specific topic so you

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,690
can start digging into those on

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,510
categorize posts and start assigning

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:26,170
them specific specific category C to

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:28,630
those posts so sometimes you have a

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,940
theme that has plugins or you install a

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,670
plug-in right for to help make things

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,410
easier like a portfolio write or like

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,870
for instance this one here in particular

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,690
we they have employees where they use a

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,860
post to custom post type for employees

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,560
it's another way to organize information

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:48,310
and and automatically puts it into a

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,199
hierarchy right and if we get really

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:55,000
fancy we can customize our URL

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:56,769
structures so that we can set these

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,329
different categories like the top one is

00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,769
actually the page level right that we

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:04,180
were looking at in the first example the

00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:07,180
second is for for blog posts for the the

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,480
post category and then the last is the

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,889
team

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,329
that's the custom post type where we had

00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,180
the URL structure where it shows team

00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:16,269
and then the name of the the employee at

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,949
the firm so you start to see some

00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:22,329
hierarchy within the URL structure

00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:24,459
itself so as I mentioned these are the

00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:27,040
different types of groupings that you

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:28,600
can have you know ecommerce sites

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,980
product categories is probably the most

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,019
common but blog topics too and in like

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,730
company departments within your in your

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:38,500
business or within your clients business

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,060
you can set these hierarchies within

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:45,010
that as well and the another pro tip

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,810
about the the categories is that you can

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,149
actually optimize the categories

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,730
themselves a lot of times when I find

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,980
with WordPress sites is that categories

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,899
are set but then there's no content

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,399
that's on the category itself right the

00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,139
category just lives by itself with a

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,760
bunch of posts that are associated with

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:02,680
it but you can actually start to

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,860
optimize those categories so they can

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,510
serve as landing pages if if you heard

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,930
about like hub spot in there pillar

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,790
content methodology where they have like

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,910
a large topic that links to other

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,160
different topics that are related to it

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,440
that this applies here where you can

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,910
optimize the category for SEO so you can

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,760
get those keywords for that general

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,250
topic and then your topics that are

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,310
related to that topic that are get a

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,680
little more granular they can get linked

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,500
from these within the category page and

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,470
then your helping feed that relevancy

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,269
all the way down into your posts because

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,819
a lot of times what happens with posts

00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:44,680
is that they get buried right if you go

00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,230
through your like if you just have all

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,510
your posts under your blog for instance

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,610
and you go through your archive of your

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,790
blog post and you have a lot of blog

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,430
posts they they end up on page 2 and

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,440
page 3 of your blog right and so if you

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,269
start assigning categories to your blog

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,130
posts and you optimize those categories

00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,470
you're making it easier for not only

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,980
people to come find your content that's

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,569
related to that category but you're also

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,519
making it easier for search engines to

00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:16,569
find those pages that have been long

00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:20,550
buried down within your archives does

00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:20,550
that make sense ok cool

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,610
all right so let's talk about site

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:35,160
navigation and how this all applies to

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:37,710
that yeah good question yeah so limit is

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,230
trying to get to four levels so you

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,000
don't want to get too granular with your

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,490
subcategories because then you know

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,350
you're you can come up with a

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,140
subcategory for just about anything

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:53,990
right but ideally you don't want to get

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:58,050
to more than four levels deep yeah so

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,520
looking at navigation we're gonna use

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,920
eBay as an example because I think eBay

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,230
does a really good job but putting

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,950
putting all the important elements on

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,330
there in their navigation and so you can

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,580
see that they're thinking about

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,680
different people who come to the site

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,600
right and this is on the this is

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,130
basically going to the eBay homepage and

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,960
looking at the navigation up there they

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,360
have the selling tools right like my

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,040
eBay to look at your account on the top

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,670
right hand corner right they've got that

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,350
big search bar they they've got the the

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,670
login and sign in right those are all

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,830
important things that they see that

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,510
clients need to do but a lot of the

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,000
focuses all the different categories

00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,160
that they have right so having a good

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,570
navigation helps people find the content

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,570
on your site that you want them to find

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:45,330
right it also can help show the

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,920
hierarchy right so you can break down

00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,910
the hierarchy into these like different

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:53,700
menus that you have within your site and

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,410
then like I mentioned before if you

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,300
start having lots of content then you

00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,530
don't want to link to every little page

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,090
that you have on your site and that's

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,620
like where categories can come in where

00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,510
you can link to all the different

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,050
categories that you have and then they

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,090
can get to those important pages so if

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,300
we start looking drilling down into the

00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:14,250
the navigation for eBay you can see that

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,110
they have different categories right for

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,700
all the different shopping so Motors

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,740
fashion they see these as the most

00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,040
important right electronics collectibles

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,050
home-and-garden

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,040
and so even within electronics you can

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,680
see that they're linking to

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,030
subcategories right so under electronics

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,480
you sees cameras

00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,410
smart smart home tablets and then

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,209
there's these additional

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,040
categories all right because eBay knows

00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,379
that a lot of people are looking at

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,459
these sub sub categories and so they

00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,920
want to put those front and center

00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:46,379
within the navigation so they're not

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,970
linking to every single category like

00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,709
you notice there's no turntables up here

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,060
right I mean not that many people are

00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,850
really buying records sorry but some

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,889
people are like me and like park and so

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,060
but you're not gonna find that up here

00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,639
more people are gonna be more inclined

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:04,860
to buy iPhones and laptops then vinyl

00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:07,019
records breadcrumbs are also a way to

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,029
help nap navigate people within your

00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,579
site and so it improves the user

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:13,079
experience for those who land on maybe

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:16,019
some of your pages that get higher

00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:19,100
rankings and may not be coming to your

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:22,050
homepage directly and it also tells

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,209
search engines the site structure and

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,910
how it looks right gives them a good

00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:31,980
idea of what that site structure is and

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:33,389
I'm sorry how do i how do I make a bear

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,980
a breadcrumb yeah

00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:40,759
so with depending on your theme and

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:43,889
depending on the plugin that you use

00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,720
some themes like Genesis will allow you

00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:49,199
to have breadcrumbs and you just have to

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:53,029
check a checkbox to enable it Yoast also

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:56,670
Yoast SEO plug-in also offers some

00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:59,370
breadcrumb abilities yeah and you have

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,459
to put some extra code into I think your

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,339
functions.php in order to activate the

00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,929
breadcrumbs so and it looks like your

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,959
current site structure as you have it

00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:14,339
set so for instance in this navigation

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,600
here this is using this is like a

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,890
product navigation where it's looking at

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,900
the home and then there's the category

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,309
for cookware and then we've drill it

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,470
down to the brand and then the actual

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,880
subcategory there so and the and the

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,860
plus side to doing this also is that

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,450
Google will sometimes display your

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,270
breadcrumb navigation within the search

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:36,179
results if you have the metadata put in

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:38,490
and most of those breadcrumb plugins

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:44,760
will will allow you will include that

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:46,140
that that metadata cool so thinking

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,520
about your navigation make it easier for

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,330
people to find the important parts of

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,090
your site

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,039
usability is key don't overwhelm the

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,580
visitor with all the different navigate

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,929
all the with your menu basically use

00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,880
anchor text that makes it clear that

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:05,460
what the the link is that they're

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:11,850
clicking to and organize it as it

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:15,570
mirrors your your site architecture so

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,620
let's talk about the home page okay

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,049
the home page serves as your

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,909
navigational hub for all the visitors

00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,350
that come to your site a lot of people

00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:24,090
will come to your site typing into the

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,710
domain name or they may be searching for

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,049
your business and then your site comes

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:33,210
up right and so they're most likely

00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:34,919
coming to your home page not always but

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,630
mostly because sometimes you may have a

00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,010
piece of content that gets viral right

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,090
and that gets more traffic but most of

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,330
the time is they're coming to your home

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,039
page so use the home page to link to

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,990
those important pages this example is

00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,909
using Amazon from when it first launched

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,679
right around the time it launched and so

00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:51,149
you can see even then they were linking

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,010
to these important pages like the

00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:54,120
spotlight in 1 million titles and

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,610
bragging about the fact that they have a

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,870
million titles right and then your

00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,580
account just like we were looking at

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,779
eBay right they know that people want to

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,250
look at their account and see the status

00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:05,309
of their order so they make sure that

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,740
that's on the home page more recently

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:10,559
this is eBay's home page this is in

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,370
January so the big thing was like

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,529
tidying up right like Marie Kondo

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,789
sparking joy right and she's about to

00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:20,460
pull all that stuff out of her closet

00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,929
and you know start deciding which one is

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,299
gonna spark joy and she's gonna hug it

00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:29,039
and get rid of it right so so they even

00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,360
knows this so it's like okay we're going

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,159
on link to a bunch of products that can

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,350
help people organize right and so

00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,549
there's a lot of winter things going on

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,809
there's the big game so it was around

00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,880
the Superbowl so they know people are

00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:41,190
looking for TVs right we gotta have the

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,679
nicest TVs in order to bring my friends

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,230
to watch the Superbowl and and then

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,429
there's like winter gear so this is all

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,960
the important stuff that they want they

00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:51,240
also want people to click on ads right

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,440
and because they know a lot of people

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,519
come to their site and they also want

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,600
people to sign up for credit cards so

00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,830
they put all that stuff on their home

00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:02,220
page okay let's talk about contextual

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:04,620
linking contextual links

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,500
our links that link between the

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:11,370
different pages within your site and so

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,960
that the contextual linking links to

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,549
important pages and provides clues and

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,370
search engines as to which pages are

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:19,740
important right it helps connect to

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,630
related content and allows visitors of

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,080
find content that they may not be aware

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:28,980
exists on your site give an example of

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,330
this this is an article about this very

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,070
obscure band I don't know if you guys

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,230
remember the klf but they were like an

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,260
avant-garde techno band from the early

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,419
90s who are famous for having a big pop

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:44,750
hit and then burning up a million pound

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:48,059
sterling on stage because because of art

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,350
so so anyway so like this is an article

00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,270
from The Guardian talking about their

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,659
big comeback in 2017 but really they

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:56,610
just wrote a book and so the the article

00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,870
itself links and I know the text is a

00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,039
little hard to read because this is not

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,440
really good usability because you're

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,919
using brown text and it's hard to tell

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,480
that that's a hyperlinked text but it is

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,850
those text links linked to individual

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,530
articles within the site so this is an

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:14,280
article about their comeback and about

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:15,900
their book and that link on the lower

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,210
left is linking to the book review

00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,039
itself and those two top links are

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,700
linking to pages that are about them on

00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:26,070
the Guardians website so this is and if

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,530
you notice the the the text is Bill

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,330
Drummond Jim kaat II right so those

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:33,000
texts are actually articles about those

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,820
people and it's using anchor text which

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,409
is the text that's underlined to just

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,360
inform and describe what that page is

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:45,059
about notice there's no click here right

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,460
click here no more no now you know

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:49,770
hyperlinked it is telling what that page

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,150
is about and that's important for Google

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,580
to understand and for people to

00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,929
understand what that information is

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,610
I don't know how many times I've seen

00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:57,330
like this here and I'm like I don't know

00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,830
what that is

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,130
like click here what does this click

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,809
here you know if visually if I'm trying

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,850
to get to something then knowing what

00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:08,270
that page is about and knowing that text

00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:10,530
that informs that hyperlink helps me

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:14,240
another example of contextual links is

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:17,119
like on Amazon I was shopping for for

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:22,320
protein shakes because

00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:24,779
or bro team shakes whatever so these are

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,190
all suggested items based on me looking

00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:30,929
at this this protein so obviously the

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,429
text is very informative right it tells

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,350
me exactly what it is and you can see

00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:37,200
somebody really SEO the you know what

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,690
about for these listings because they

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,279
put every keyword within that title but

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,009
it tells me what that page is about

00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,259
right so I if I'm interested in a

00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:47,639
different flavor I may click on one of

00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,710
those other links rather than the one

00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:53,909
that I'm on so it's helpful

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,590
another contextual link is tags so if

00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:57,269
you're content if you're using tags on

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,129
your on your site that's another way to

00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:01,859
help people find other content on your

00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:03,539
site but they don't have a hierarchy so

00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:06,989
they're not like categories categories

00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:08,730
have a hierarchy tags do not an example

00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:10,799
would be like on a recipe site you look

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,710
at recipe ingredients those could serve

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,320
as your tags and they shouldn't compete

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,359
with your categories so if using the

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,539
same tags and categories interchangeably

00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:23,820
then it's time to rethink how do you

00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:25,739
want to use your tags

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,149
especially tags I see it all the time

00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:29,669
with tags because a lot of times you

00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:31,109
have people involved with your content

00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:32,850
who may not be aware and they're like oh

00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,409
I know I need to add keywords so I'm

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,389
just gonna start adding tags and then

00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:38,429
you look at you go into the WordPress

00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:39,419
dashboard and you see all the tags that

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:41,489
you have and all of a sudden you have

00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,220
like 500 tags that you weren't aware

00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:46,739
existed each of those tags do generate

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,019
pages on the site right within WordPress

00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:51,179
and so what you might find is that these

00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:55,080
tags just don't have enough content on

00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,970
those pages so I always recommend doing

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,850
an audit when it comes to that and we'll

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,039
talk about that in a second

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,970
so as I mentioned audit to your blog

00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:07,230
posts like look for look at your content

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,690
that you already have on your site is

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,970
there a page that's related to the

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,769
content that you just wrote then link to

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,210
it make sure to have a link that within

00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:17,659
your content that links to that other

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,159
piece of content that's strongly related

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:23,929
using descriptive anchor text and avoid

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,190
things like click here all right so

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,409
alright now that I've been barded you

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,490
with all this stuff what are we going to

00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:32,760
do next

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,440
well first don't burn down the house you

00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,590
don't have to do that you know how to

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,240
set everything on fire but there's some

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,799
things you can do to just get a good

00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,630
assessment and good idea of what to do

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,220
next so one good thing is to look at

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,460
your site structure if you haven't done

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,440
this so already there are tools that you

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,299
can find and use that can help crawl

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,580
your site and give you a picture of what

00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:59,159
your site structure looks like screaming

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,169
frog SEO is a great tool it's a desktop

00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:05,279
app that you can use in Windows and on

00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:07,710
the Mac it is a I guess freemium model

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,320
where it's free for like 500 links but

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,760
if your site is or 500 pages but if your

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,880
site is larger than that you have to pay

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,169
it's like $150 and it is an

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,730
indispensable tool not just for like SEO

00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:22,409
work but actually just getting an

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,270
understanding of of your site and

00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:25,880
looking at the technical pieces around

00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:30,179
your site so I highly recommend

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,649
screaming frog SEO SEO chat website

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,500
crawler it's not one that gets mentioned

00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:36,390
very often but it's also a free tool and

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,210
you can just have it crawl your site and

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,340
they'll give you a picture it's not

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,539
pretty picture but it's a it's a it'll

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,570
give you an idea of what your structure

00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:48,929
looks like power mapper and dynamap are

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,340
all paid tools but they also do similar

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:52,470
things and they can generate sitemaps

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,390
for you although we're using WordPress

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,960
so we we can find a plug-in that works

00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,960
for that right

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,620
so another thing you do is sketch out

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,580
your your structure so grab a pen and

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,440
paper look at the important things that

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,820
that are the important content or the

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,490
important subject areas that you want to

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:15,090
cover on your site right can you group

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:17,250
these ideas together and and step away

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,990
from the computer for a second because a

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,659
lot of times we're just plugging in

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,000
content or writing content I need to do

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,649
that more but you know we're adding more

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,870
and more content we kind of forget what

00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:29,850
we're doing with our site and so just

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,409
getting an idea of what our focus is can

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,990
help us put all this content together

00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:36,770
that we have and like I mentioned don't

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,510
want to go more than four levels deep

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,669
lucidchart is where I created these that

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,049
the site structure before is is a tool

00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:44,549
that you can use and

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:48,659
Maps is also another tool where you can

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:50,909
just map these out but yet using pen and

00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,710
paper mind mapping tools those are all

00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,720
great ideas that take you away from your

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,989
site itself and think about restart

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,399
thinking about your content I mentioned

00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:02,249
this a little earlier like audit your

00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:05,909
Cod it your categories and tags think

00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:07,739
about what your categories are look at

00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,330
the list are your caddy do you have a

00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:12,389
plural and the singular version of a

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,769
specific word right have you put too

00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:15,869
many categories that you don't need is

00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:17,129
your uncatted

00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:20,279
have a bunch of blog posts that are

00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:22,470
associated with it clean those out and

00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,090
also if you have contributors come up

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,340
with a plan so people understand when

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,779
they're adding content to the site there

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,470
are categories that should be assigned

00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:33,179
and not to create additional ones and

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,309
clean up your tags but we already talked

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,559
about that right you guys are all going

00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:38,419
to do that right clean up your tags all

00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,739
right cool

00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:41,929
sitemaps so we touched on this a little

00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:44,460
bit

00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:47,039
look your sitemap displays the side

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,249
heart hierarchy on an HTML sitemap

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,499
displays the site hierarchy on your site

00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:54,779
those are less and less common now but

00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:57,989
you can still do that Google will crawl

00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:59,460
your site and crawl your HTML sitemap if

00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:03,779
that's something that you want to add to

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,399
your site an XML sitemap is like one

00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:08,700
that is generated from Yoast and

00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:10,739
generated from and from any other

00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,850
sitemap plug-in that you can upload to

00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:18,809
Google and Bing how many of y'all are

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:23,399
using a Google search console how many

00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:26,730
are not ok when you go home today those

00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:28,739
who haven't you can easily sign up for

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,989
Google search console it basically gives

00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:33,659
you a sense as to how Google sees your

00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:35,399
site how Google crawls your site and you

00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:38,669
get email alerts in case they find

00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:41,129
something wrong with your site but it's

00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:42,570
a great way to see how Google is when

00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:44,940
they crawl the site what did they see

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,580
are they seeing a lot of errors and it's

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,720
free it's a free tool so I highly

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,529
recommend you do that and you can submit

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,529
your sitemap to it

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,679
yeah I mean not necessarily I mean it

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,059
what what it could do I mean if you're

00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,890
really concerned about that you could

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:30,350
also set it to no index so that Google

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:35,809
doesn't index it and send those links

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:37,610
through but it helps users so like the

00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:40,789
the thing that I find is especially with

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:45,559
when it comes to SEO is that you know

00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:47,570
nevertrump usability / SEO right like

00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:50,120
you want to find a happy balance for the

00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,970
two and so if it's gonna help your

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,880
visitors come to your site to find

00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:57,620
content then I think it's a good thing

00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,840
plus you don't have to link to every

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,240
single last page in your sitemap you can

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,309
limit it to a certain number of pages

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,399
just so they can get through and get

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:12,440
find the worth what they're looking for

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:15,710
so cool so if you start updating your

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,210
your site your site structure start

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,840
updating your URLs you want to make sure

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:23,679
that you have 301 redirects in place and

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,679
301 is a is a directive that's sent to

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,630
browsers and crawlers that this page has

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:34,190
been moved to a new location permanently

00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:36,500
and so it sets the new canonical for the

00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,909
URL so if you have a page that has links

00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,590
pointing to it then you want to make

00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:41,299
sure that if you change that URL that it

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:48,740
gets redirected otherwise you're gonna

00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:52,520
have four or four errors so hopefully

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:54,169
this helped you guys think about how to

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,179
restructure your site so it doesn't look

00:30:54,169 --> 00:31:01,389
so much like this and it looks more like

00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:01,389
this cool thank you very much

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,570
we have time for Q&A

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:28,840
okay yeah you got it yeah it it depends

00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,350
I mean it could but usually with that oh

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm sorry

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,290
does your asking whether the the 301

00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,090
redirect goes into the head of the page

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:40,240
where does it go it depends sometimes

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:43,240
it's handled in htaccess file it can be

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,640
handled within the database itself it

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,400
can be handled within the HTML or within

00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:52,030
the pH like PHP it's all it depends so

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,650
it depends on the plugin you use but all

00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,240
you and there's a way to check it so you

00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,700
can check they're free tools out there

00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,530
so that if you set a 301 redirect you

00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:06,060
can check to see that it actually is

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:08,590
functioning as it should yeah so the I

00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:10,870
believe within WordPress it

00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:14,440
automatically will redirect some posts

00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:17,830
if you change the slug and there are and

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,780
Yoast will do some of that too but the

00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,210
redirection plug-in is like my favorite

00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,890
plugins to use and even within

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,080
redirection you can set how you want the

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,790
redirect to today without getting too

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,950
technical you can decide with how you

00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:37,990
want the server to act on that

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:38,740
redirection yeah yeah so 301 sets it

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,710
permanently

00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,140
so the 3-1 makes it clear to browsers

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,630
and search engines like we this page is

00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:49,560
now over here so used to be at this URL

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,560
now it's in this URL

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,679
so with 302s the question is whether

00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,690
three what is the the benefits between

00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,809
or the difference between using 301 and

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:12,160
302 and what the benefits are so with

00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:14,380
the with the 302 your you're setting it

00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,360
temporarily and so let's say you have a

00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,780
holiday some sort of holiday special and

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,610
you want the a specific page to go to

00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:23,410
another page for a temporary basis and

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,970
then you want that page to go back to

00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,160
the original page then that's when you

00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,890
would use the 302 however Google said

00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,929
that they look if it the 302 redirect is

00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,130
in place for a long period of time say

00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,540
like six months

00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,090
then they'll just treat it as a 301

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,710
redirect but then you're telling you

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,860
want if you if you do want it to be

00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,330
permanent then you want them to know

00:33:41,860 --> 00:34:09,669
that it's permanent rather than having

00:33:43,330 --> 00:34:11,320
them guess right yeah yeah yeah right so

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:13,090
the question is do you how long do you

00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,850
have to keep that 301 redirect if you've

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,679
created this structure change and do you

00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:20,800
have to keep it to eternity or not right

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,139
and so the answer is the if if there are

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,940
backlinks pointing to that old URL then

00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:27,760
you definitely want to keep those 301

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,379
redirects in place and so otherwise it's

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,450
going to still generate a 404 error

00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:33,460
because we know that a lot of people

00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:36,340
don't update their links right you know

00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,720
that's a very common practice and so you

00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,560
want to keep those through one redirects

00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,240
for those pages

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,919
specifically and Google said like if you

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,869
after a certain time like after a year

00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:49,210
or so it doesn't matter like they don't

00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:51,490
look they know now that that redirect

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,080
has been is permanent and these are

00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,320
pages that don't have backlinks right

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:58,330
these are URLs with no backlinks they

00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,790
realize that okay this new URL is the

00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:03,640
new canonical so which means the new

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:05,170
this is the new correct URL so then you

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,109
don't need to keep those three 301

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,100
redirects for those other pages so it

00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:12,760
depends

00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:14,110
if there's backlinks yes if there's no

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:19,290
backlinks you can probably ditch them

00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:19,290
after a year yeah

00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,440
so I yeah I think I talked about a

00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:35,010
little bit about my so which meta tags

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,360
are useful and not useful so the

00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:40,450
important meta tag when it comes to like

00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,270
SEO is the Meta Description there are a

00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,500
lot of meta tags for starters and you

00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,000
can create a meta tag for anything

00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,130
because it's all information right so

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,810
you you can create a meta tag to do like

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,630
site verifications and do all kinds of

00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:55,090
things but when it comes to SEO that the

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,550
Meta Description is the most important

00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,870
only in the sense that it allows that

00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:03,370
Meta Description to appear in the search

00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:05,950
results if the search query matches the

00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,460
content that's in that in that Meta

00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,040
Description

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,140
there's no direct you can stuff all the

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,300
keywords you want but it doesn't give

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,140
you any kind of ranking boost because

00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,090
you have them in the Meta Description

00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,310
all it does is it allows you to show

00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:21,550
that text within the Meta Description

00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:23,050
itself so that when people are searching

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,850
for it they can see that text get

00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:27,340
highlighted in the search results which

00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:31,120
may lead to more clicks on your listing

00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:36,300
right so that that's the most important

00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,300
when it comes to comes SEO yeah yeah

00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:59,650
yeah sure yeah if you the question was

00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,440
like if you have one single if you have

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,910
a single product do you and you're using

00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,110
WooCommerce and you don't want to use

00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:11,170
that product with product within the URL

00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:13,780
do you pull it out I mean you could and

00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,850
you can market it easily more much more

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,040
easily right I mean you could tighten up

00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,870
that URL so it looks prettier so even

00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,070
outside of like any SEO benefit that you

00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,070
get like even just

00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:30,250
there yes you believe there's a way you

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,350
can pull the product and this is where

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,910
it gets dangerous mind you there's a way

00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,800
you can probably put a pulled product

00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,050
out of WooCommerce and I don't know the

00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,600
answer to that but there could be a way

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,860
to pull the product out of the URL but

00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,200
if you do that you have to make sure

00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,370
that you redirect but then if you start

00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,570
adding products and you might want to

00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:51,460
rethink your your strategy and you know

00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,900
ultimately it's about the interlinking

00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,460
it's about the structure it's about like

00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,460
thinking about your categories and how

00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:05,340
they link to one another ultimately so

00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:05,340
yeah uh-huh

00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:17,830
sure I'm sorry I missed the last part

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:24,910
yeah right yep it's a brochure of site

00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:28,690
yeah correct

00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:30,790
yes yeah the question is you if you have

00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,050
a brochure site like a minimal site with

00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,160
not that much content there's only so

00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:37,920
much benefit you can get from site

00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,920
structure and the answer is yes yeah

00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:47,460
yeah yeah

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,619
the question was about pages and whether

00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,420
it has to be able to assign categories

00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,579
to pages and tags

00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:04,319
well you can't you can't you can't

00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:06,900
assign categories and tags to pages

00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:08,759
themselves but you can set the hierarchy

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,579
within the pages themselves so if you go

00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:14,819
into pages you can actually set a

00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:17,630
structure for the pages themselves yeah

00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,630
yeah

00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:34,979
that's totally different different topic

00:39:32,219 --> 00:40:05,210
that yeah yeah so we can talk about that

00:39:34,979 --> 00:40:07,380
after yeah yeah yeah I D Li yeah oh so

00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:10,799
the question is whether you can use the

00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:19,609
same keywords or same words for tags and

00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:19,609
category you can you can but I mean yeah

00:40:26,349 --> 00:41:00,910
which part yeah well it sounds it's no

00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:00,910
no it sounds like something that it

00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:08,359
hears let me let me answer it this way

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:10,130
with categories you are creating topic

00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:12,920
areas right like you're organizing your

00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:16,220
content to fall under specific subjects

00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,950
right with tags you're getting a little

00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:21,680
more granular right that's and that's

00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,940
just thinking about that's not thinking

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,099
about keyword stuffing that's not

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:29,839
thinking about like any anything like

00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:31,279
that it's more about ultimately what is

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,670
it helping the users of helping the

00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:37,069
visitor right it's not about gaming

00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:40,220
Google or what is gonna knock you down

00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:42,230
right because this is the this is all

00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,079
about like how do we make the content

00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:47,599
easier to find how do we make it more

00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,430
user friendly you know for the most part

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,920
most I would say most blogs don't need

00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,960
tags right like unless you're getting

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,309
very granular about things and that's

00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,220
when you the tags come into place

00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:59,900
because like you know because those tags

00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,250
will generate pages and then you end up

00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,579
with a bunch of ages that Google has to

00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:08,049
crawl right that don't need indexing so

00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:08,049
does that help answer

00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:22,700
yeah the yeah the Yost actually the u.s.

00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,050
website does a really good job with

00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,680
their content talking about site

00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:30,770
structure and the the videos blog the

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,510
Moz blog the 8hrs blog also those are

00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:44,950
all I would consider those to be really

00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:44,950
good resources for for SEO yeah yeah

00:42:46,360 --> 00:43:00,410
yeah yeah sure yeah yeah absolutely

00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,640
yeah kettlebells the kettle because you

00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,930
know google understands the difference

00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,580
between the two right like it even knows

00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,100
the doors between lauren attorney you

00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,890
know I mean um and knows that I should

00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,120
say and knows that they're one in the

00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,170
same right somebody looking for an

00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:21,700
attorneys probably looking for a lawyer

00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:21,700
vice versa yeah yeah it's okay bad

00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:49,680
uh-huh oh yeah okay you could yeah no I

00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,320
I don't I wouldn't use no follow for for

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,140
any really much of anything yeah unless

00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:58,320
you like maybe blog comments right like

00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:00,420
that's bite on by default right or if

00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,100
you're talking about somebody maybe you

00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,260
don't like or you're talking about a

00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:06,540
subject matter that is controversial and

00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,940
you're just using it as an example then

00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:10,680
you might know follow that link right

00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,970
you're not endorsing that site you're

00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:22,550
just linking to it because it's

00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:25,170
informative yeah the readability score

00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:29,010
this is a little off-topic too but as

00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:31,170
far as readability score like I wouldn't

00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,640
get too bogged down with it you know the

00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,490
important thing is to create unique

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,900
original content that's compelling and I

00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:40,650
know like a lot of people get bogged

00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,140
down with the details of like of metrics

00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,070
right when really and then you spend so

00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,330
much time doing that that you don't

00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,650
you're not doing the work that you need

00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,110
to do right like which is create

00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,450
compelling original content making a

00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:55,800
site creating a site that's very user

00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:57,900
friendly you know so it's I think it's

00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,250
good as a benchmark and to know that

00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,690
you're moving in the right direction and

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,260
so then it's like oh I'm gonna improve

00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,430
my content going forward but yeah I I

00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:21,830
wouldn't get too bogged down in details

00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:21,830
yeah you've been yeah sorry yeah

00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:50,720
yeah yeah so the question is whether to

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,130
use like landing pages as if you're

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,420
using if you already have landing pages

00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,790
created to use those landing pages

00:45:53,420 --> 00:46:01,040
versus going into like categories that

00:45:55,790 --> 00:46:03,860
you already have and I have I'm figuring

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,570
that out still but it is a tough one

00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,190
because if you already I mean if you

00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,510
have that landing page already and it's

00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:11,810
an it's already connected to that

00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:15,290
content you almost don't need it I'm

00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:16,820
experimenting with that now is is the

00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,110
category versus landing page because

00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,060
there's there are some instances where

00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:22,280
you end up with a site that has all

00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,020
these landing pages already created have

00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,910
backlinks pointing to them they they're

00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,330
they're already doing well so then you

00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,830
don't want to mess with it right

00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,300
and you already linking to all that good

00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,280
content so it's applying those best

00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:40,660
practices so then maybe don't need the

00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,660
category in that instance yeah

00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,140
yeah

00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:52,730
so the different the question is the

00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:55,780
difference between category and tag and

00:46:52,730 --> 00:47:16,760
and so the categories are are

00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:21,020
hierarchical yeah yep no it's it's a

00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:25,100
page right so it'll index it the same

00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:28,280
way being will index it same way no no

00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,690
no no but you want to optimize both so

00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,950
like if you have tag pages and category

00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:32,180
pages you want to optimize both of those

00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:36,170
pages as best as you can

00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:38,060
yeah any other questions cool awesome

00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:43,000
thanks guys thanks for sticking around

00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:43,000
