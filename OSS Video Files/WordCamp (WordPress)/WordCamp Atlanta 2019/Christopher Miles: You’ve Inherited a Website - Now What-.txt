thank you for hearing that bio again I

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,770
should probably take front-end

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,480
development out of that just because

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,330
I've been now surrounded by so many

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,380
talented devs that I'm like wow okay now

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,450
that I've seen real friend and

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,900
development I'm just gonna stick to

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,539
product management so you've inherited a

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,150
website now what I when I go to word

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,590
camps a lot of the time I'm hanging out

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,510
near the Bluehost booth because they're

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,990
nice enough to send me out to them and a

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,640
question that I get a lot cuz I'm always

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,480
asking hey what brings yet to word camp

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,760
while you here what are you trying to

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,700
learn what are you trying to solve is I

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,350
don't know yet I was just handed this

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,780
website and what do I do with it

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,879
right I've heard it's WordPress I don't

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,579
know what to do and there's a variety of

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,219
directions that that this could go but

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,129
just so that I can get an idea of the

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:57,390
audience raise your hand if you can if

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:00,140
you've ever used WordPress before okay

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,420
have you ever built a website before

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:08,700
okay and are you inheriting a website

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:11,340
soon hands up okay perfect so before we

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,780
do this I usually tell people like

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,509
there's a lot of things to think about

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,640
but don't be overwhelmed by like this

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,150
long list of things because not

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,490
everything applies to everyone right so

00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,259
my kind of expectation with this is that

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,630
I can name off a few things that apply

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,430
to a lot of situations and that you can

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,009
just sort of kapha stir cafeteria-style

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,360
pick and choose hey this sounds like

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,770
something that would be useful hey I

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,880
don't know if that really applies to me

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,430
or not

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,250
as far as the slides themselves I just

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,290
tweeted out a link on my Twitter that

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,659
has the article version of all of this

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,579
information so take notes if you want

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,579
but it's also mostly all in the article

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,700
so you've inherited a website what do

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,149
you do first the first thing that I try

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,490
to do is understand the responsibility

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,229
that I am taking on right and sometimes

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,509
unfortunately during a handoff that's

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,250
one of the things that gets lost is the

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:13,410
the role that that is meant here are you

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,420
just trying to keep the lights on

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,280
while somebody else is gonna take over

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,220
something or are you taking over so that

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,170
you can rebuild something or are you

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,660
taking over all of web presence which

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,680
may include more than just a website so

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,810
understanding that is going to be

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,700
important but assuming that we're just

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,170
talking about a website and a wordpress

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,760
website let's start there so I usually

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,280
start looking through everything that we

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,800
have and just get at least one login I'm

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,660
an administrator login to WordPress and

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,340
that's a good starting point and just

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,870
sort of read it read through what you

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,030
have what plugins do you have what

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,290
themes do you have what things are you

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:55,410
using is are you using a child theme or

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,660
not and then once you've taken sort of

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,150
an inventory of like here's here's where

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,070
I'm at this is what I'm using and you

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,230
know you can judge the decisions of the

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,540
last person and they are using this page

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:10,260
builder okay you know you can once you

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,520
get past that phase then switch hats a

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,920
little bit and start to read through it

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,810
as a user right and pretend that you're

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,010
just a you like logout even if you want

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,810
because sometimes things look different

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,570
when you're logged in and just start

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,010
clicking through I you know for most of

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,270
the time it's gonna be informational or

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,730
a blog or something like that but if

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,140
it's a web application you know also use

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,450
it the way a user would and just go

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,880
through these flows and figure out what

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,680
works for you what seems to make sense

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,590
how are users interacting with this just

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,230
so that you can get a sense of things

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,230
like the you know overall tone of the

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,250
copy the personality of the brand and

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,460
some of these things that you're

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,830
inheriting so that you know suddenly

00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,330
there's not a massive shift in the voice

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,810
of what's happening the day that you

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,880
takeover right so like get an idea at

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,230
least what you have right you know what

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,690
plugins you have you know it seems you

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,250
have you know things like that so once

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,230
you have that then do a little bit more

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,000
of a technical deep dive and start

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,150
asking questions like this one who owns

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,340
a domain name and if the answer is the

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,450
company but who actually owns the domain

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,670
name right and maybe even look it up

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,109
yourself just despite what people might

00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,419
tell you oh it's this person that person

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:27,210
because one thing that I have found is

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,830
that a lot of times

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,020
the answer to that question might be

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,370
surprising and you might find oh yeah

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,979
the ex-ceo

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,139
I guess technically still owns that well

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:40,080
I guess technically he shouldn't so

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,479
let's write down that that's that's a

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,060
thing on our to-do list is let's get

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,870
that domain over to us as soon as

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,169
possible all right

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,610
and it's not just domain name it might

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,410
not be in the same place as the hosting

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,979
and it might get even a little trickier

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,930
than that because sometimes you'll have

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,479
well we've got our main website on

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,550
WordPress but we've got a subdomain

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,289
that's an application that's maybe on

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,840
something else and we've got a couple

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:09,000
clickfunnels over here and if you go to

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,069
this subdomain it's this other thing so

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,270
like who owns the hosting might be

00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:16,229
different depending on where you're at

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,970
and the hosting you know it might just

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,800
be oh yeah we have WP engine we have

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,330
Bluehost we have this that or it might

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,889
be a complicated infrastructure that

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,569
like Oh talked to somebody on the admin

00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,090
team so like figure out what that looks

00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:31,039
like and who's your point of contact

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:35,490
there and is everything in order there

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,430
then anything else that is subscription

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,169
level for the business a lot of times

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,090
when people have to especially at small

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,190
organizations have to wear multiple hats

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,620
you'll get a lot of people using their

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,460
personal accounts for business things

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,020
right and you'll find oh hey whoo you

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,780
know we have this we have that who owns

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,280
the monitoring software oh well the the

00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,539
dev at the time set it up on his

00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,740
personal credit card and it's

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,289
technically in his name

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,280
well that means technically owns it so

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:08,370
you know figure those things out if if

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,560
you he ever left your kids with

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,580
babysitters and you make a list of phone

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,590
numbers and you put it on the fridge

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,150
think of it like that you want to

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,520
assemble this list of phone numbers to

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,020
put on your fridge so that you're not

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,900
trying to solve these questions in the

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,900
middle of the night when your domain

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,310
expires right you want to you want to

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,530
have this question solved when

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,949
everyone's you know happy to be

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,560
answering your questions you won't think

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,630
of everything probably I mean maybe you

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,479
will but don't plan on knowing

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,230
everything so try to have at least one

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,120
point of

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,430
contact for most categories of things

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,410
say if I if I don't know a technical

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,730
thing at least have a point of contact

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,320
where you can say okay well I don't

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,940
necessarily know everything but maybe I

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,030
don't need to maybe there's just a guy

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,810
or someone else that I can talk to that

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,280
might be able to answer that question

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,580
another thing to think about is even if

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,250
all you care about is the WordPress site

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,800
there's other things that impact that so

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,200
like who owns email accounts who owns

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,100
resetting email accounts and some of

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,550
these things so if you're gonna be

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,740
facilitating some kind of hand off or

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,140
inheriting something some property there

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,490
are things that are lateral to WordPress

00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:27,320
that might impact you and that might

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:29,430
leave some accounts unprotected so

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,710
things like email addresses are

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,810
important so things to consider when

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,860
you're actually doing the handoff talk

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,780
to the original owner

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,240
hopefully the original owner is around

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,280
I've had some unfortunate conversations

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,900
in the past where you have to take over

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,610
because someone was fired or because

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,080
someone's no longer available or because

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,120
of some other reason those are really

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,760
tricky because you have to sort of work

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,620
around that person and hope they wrote

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,660
documentation but nobody ever writes

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,790
documentation ever it's never a thing

00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:01,110
that happens so you'll probably have to

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:03,240
start that process so yeah talk to the

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,340
previous owner as much as you can and

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,890
maintain a good relationship if you can

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,120
because you might have follow-up

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,460
questions later you might have to reach

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,980
out later and try to understand what

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,170
their responsibilities used to be

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,310
because you don't want to find out oh

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,020
yeah you're supposed to have been

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,420
managing the Twitter this whole time why

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,040
aren't you also doing that and - a -

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,410
maybe the business manager who hired you

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,880
it they might be thinking oh yeah you're

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,130
you're managing web presence when you're

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,520
thinking oh I'm managing website right

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,720
and it's not exactly the same so as long

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,430
as you have that and you have that list

00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,250
of people who to call in emergencies and

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:41,870
you know what your role is you should be

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:44,220
ready to have this handoff happen so

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,080
ideally a handoff should look like this

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,370
things should be moving along and things

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,150
should be okay and then there should be

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,710
this very graceful handoff almost never

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,870
does it look like this usually it looks

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,210
more like this

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,010
right and and for those listening in or

00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,320
reading a transcript the the difference

00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:03,490
is a relay race versus literally

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,840
throwing something over a wall right so

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,000
some things are outside of your control

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,910
right it's not necessarily your fault if

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,660
the handoff looks a little bit more like

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,400
throwing things over a wall but yeah so

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,360
the handoff itself what what should you

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,830
keep in mind when you're doing that make

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,790
sure that you have access to everything

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:28,010
you need as soon as possible so that's

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,750
the first part but the second part of

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,480
that is making sure eventually and

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,690
without you know stepping on too many

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,490
toes that the wrong people don't have

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,010
access to things that they shouldn't

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,540
have and sometimes and you'll want to

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,000
make sure that you understand what it

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,650
should be sometimes that means also if

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,140
someone's handing you a key

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,870
that you take away their copies of the

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,370
key so understand what that should be

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,840
and make sure that you're doing that

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:58,610
right so if it's something like oh I

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,820
need to give you a password or something

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,550
like that don't email it don't do

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,650
anything like that there's ways that you

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,260
can hand off accounts and passwords that

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,790
you can think about so if you're gonna

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,040
if you're gonna hand off access there

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,900
are services online things like LastPass

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,110
one password dashlane whatever else

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,090
there's a million of them that will

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,980
somewhat securely hold the password for

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,620
you at least that's you know what

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,600
they're selling I don't prefer this

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,010
method although it does work and it is

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,190
convenient for some people and sometimes

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,530
convenience wins the method that I

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,570
prefer is replacing the account

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,040
altogether so if it's possible try to

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,290
get a different account for whatever it

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,230
is and grant yourself those permissions

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,170
rather than handing off a password

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,610
sometimes that's not possible and if you

00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,840
can't replace an account sometimes you

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,580
can sort of do the same thing and just

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,140
change a level of access on that account

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,330
to be you instead of the other person

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,120
like a lot of times that takes the form

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,440
of change the email on file then reset

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,500
the password like normal now you have

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,210
access and you have de facto removed the

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,700
last person's access hopefully

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,120
so and I'm not just talking about

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,100
WordPress here I'm talking about really

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,649
any type of account that is going to be

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,000
relevant to this handoff so this could

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:21,750
include emails

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,910
it could include mailing lists where

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,920
maybe you don't use this person at

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,860
domain.com maybe it's a distribution

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,950
list of like our whole IT team has

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,350
access so that the IT team email is on

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,940
file something like that so removing

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,190
people from email lists that they

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,040
shouldn't be on or other types of

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,860
accounts you know you'll have to figure

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,060
out what makes sense for each one and do

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,220
the handoff at a time that makes sense

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,020
so hopefully there's you can do it as

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,959
early in the process as possible

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,029
so that as questions and whatever come

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,800
up you hopefully still have a little bit

00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:02,040
of time to interact with whoever had it

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,589
before to answer some questions because

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,950
later it happens then the more risky it

00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:09,660
can get I want to talk a little bit as

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,070
well about a concept called the

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,470
principle of least privilege who's heard

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,450
of this so a few yeah few of us have

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,560
heard of this they did the idea it's a

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,850
fancy way of just saying people

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,010
shouldn't have more access than they

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:24,690
really need so why is that important

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,950
well this is what account takeover looks

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,230
like in the movies and for people

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,390
listening in this is Tom Cruise hanging

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,700
from the ceiling right typing on a

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,459
computer Mission Impossible One style

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,839
right in real life account takeover

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:39,240
doesn't look like this in real life

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,520
account takeover looks like this which

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,050
is hey please fill out this form by

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,880
today login with your work email and

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,490
fill out this form and it's actually

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,959
from a hacker it's not really from your

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,550
boss right so the reason why this is

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,820
important and why this has to do with

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,589
the principle of least privilege is

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,790
somebody who shouldn't have the root

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:04,470
keys to your critical infrastructure

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,079
shouldn't be susceptible to this so yeah

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,910
if you're able to trick a random person

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,450
maybe a new hire to your organization

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,310
this way it's sort of okay as long as

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,110
they don't have the keys to the kingdom

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,050
it's like okay well you tricked the new

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,690
person and now you have access to

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,070
the coffee machine okay right if that's

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,040
how they're in charge of that's all they

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,620
should be able to control so yeah

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,750
principle of least privilege I don't

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,230
want to pick on real-life people so I

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:36,149
won't use real examples for just this

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,649
although there have been things in real

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,640
life that have happened at major

00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:43,890
companies why this is so common so I'm

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,560
gonna use up a made-up example this is I

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:50,490
really like corny stock images it's like

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,490
a weird thing that I like and this is I

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,360
thought the perfect stock image for a

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,190
clueless CEO that wants too much access

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,329
so we're gonna call this fictional CEO

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,850
Gary and Gary is the CEO that's like oh

00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:08,459
yeah I mean he likes to micromanage

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:12,209
right so he wants way more access than

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,980
it's actually reasonable and so one way

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,589
you can make it easier for people like

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,180
Gary to understand what is reasonable

00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,700
and what is not because you don't want

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,350
to be like hey CEO no I'm not gonna do

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,339
what you ask right but instead if you

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,110
can make it easier for them to

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,320
understand what's reasonable then

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,120
there's less negotiating to do so within

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,370
WordPress there's different user roles

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,870
so you don't necessarily have to have

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,140
the case to the kingdom you can have

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:40,980
different things for example admin right

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,570
or just editor but sometimes people will

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,640
see these options and say oh yeah make

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,589
me an admin I want I'm on control I want

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,240
to be in charge but if you change these

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:49,920
roles which you can in WordPress those

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,950
plugins that will let you change just

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,529
the names of these roles change admin to

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,779
developer and now it's the CEO doesn't

00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,640
want it well I'm not a developer good

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,430
yeah you're not a developer you only get

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,110
access right it's a little bit more

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,399
helpful right we're not trying to be

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,370
tricky here we're just trying to be

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,279
helpful and say okay admin maybe in your

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,290
case something a word that you would

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,930
more understand what we mean by admin is

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,180
developer right and even though it says

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,920
editor that was a choice made back when

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,100
this was just a blogging platform and

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,410
not a everything platform so maybe

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,190
manager is a better word for editor now

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,870
right so you can rename ones or if you

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,000
want to even use other plugins you can

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,570
make up your own roles and say oh your

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,310
job is just

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,590
this thing let's just worry about that

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,260
one thing that's all you need to do so

00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,610
that if they get hacked only that one

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,500
thing that they have control over it

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,300
gets hacked and that person is safe

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,370
because it's not just about oh we don't

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,450
trust people we don't trust the CEO it's

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,180
actually that we're trying to protect

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,490
the CEO that the CEO is not liable for

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,440
hey this person the CEO was trying to be

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,720
responsive he clicked on something he

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,370
thought was a customer and actually got

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,890
the whole company hacked so we're we're

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,050
trying to protect people here by doing

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,190
this by making it more helpful so sorry

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,440
maybe that was a little bit too long on

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,840
this one thing but principle of least

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,490
privilege is important and a good time

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,360
to think about it is when you're passing

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,650
out keys so now that we have all that

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,370
out of the way and you have this

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:23,670
keychain of yours to get into everything

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,860
let's make it secure so understand the

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,560
process of how things work at this

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,720
company or this group if it's a small

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,950
group maybe all of it is you so maybe

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,810
you're gonna have to come up with all of

00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,300
this but if it's a larger group maybe

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,490
understand how things work how things

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,560
like rollouts work or how things are

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,150
changed on the site or who's going to be

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,370
sending you messages asking for things

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:48,030
to change who you should reach out to if

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,530
things are wrong and how to roll back

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,500
changes and what I mean by roll back

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:55,110
changes is my next topic backups and

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,420
versioning so you'll want to make sure

00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,220
now that things are locked down that you

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,320
can at least keep things as good as they

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,600
were when you started

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,490
right because you're you're now taking

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,730
over this project so make sure there's a

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:13,439
good robust system for backups and

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,730
whatever whatever you have running look

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,520
into that see make sure the right people

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,160
have access but also versioning if you

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,320
want you don't have to but sometimes

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,820
it's really useful to be able to say hey

00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,260
I'm gonna make this small change it's

00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,689
gonna be on a branch it's gonna be on a

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,230
version and we're gonna test this out or

00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:33,080
we're gonna a be test this right so

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,880
another thing as you're picking out a

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,400
backup solution because as you look into

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,520
your backup solution nine times out of

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,910
ten you'll find that you don't have one

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,920
so when you inevitably find that you

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,430
don't have one and you're deciding what

00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,600
you're going to

00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:54,630
test your ability to restore it if a

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,060
restore is a huge hassle or not

00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,330
practical the backup is kind of useless

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,770
right if and I'm not picking on any

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,440
backup solution in particular I'm just

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,270
describing concepts if you try to

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,950
restore because something went wrong and

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,320
you're like oh that's terrible we need

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,720
to go back in time and you try to

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,970
restore something and it downloads a zip

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,310
file to your computer how is that

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,620
helpful it's not right

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,450
so okay what do we do with this how do i

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:26,160
how do I upload this way what do I do

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:28,560
here so take a backup and restore that

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,110
backup even when you don't need to just

00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:35,970
once at least test the process of

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:39,810
restore a key takeaway here your backup

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:43,380
system is only as useful as your restore

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:44,820
system right so it doesn't matter if you

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,550
have the best backup system in the world

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,800
if when you click restore it doesn't do

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,170
what you expected and it is a huge

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,420
hassle and it takes three hours do you

00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,770
want to be doing that when you're you

00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,050
know just before a meeting with your

00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,820
boss and oh I made a change I'm trying

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,340
to change it back and I've got a zip

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,770
file here what do I do with it so yeah

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,310
backup is only as useful as your ability

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,990
to restore it a lot of hosting providers

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,450
will provide in-house backups that

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,980
sometimes a good option upside being

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,870
it's usually really easy because they're

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,540
already the hosts so the integration is

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,330
easy for them the downside is if your

00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,550
host gets hit by an asteroid then you

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,250
lose everything so it's usually a good

00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,260
idea to take your own backups or have

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,930
something off-site or talk to your host

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,060
and be like are your backups offsite you

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,880
know or something like that but it's

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,410
just something to look into

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,720
so now that you have backups in place

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:43,050
and maybe you have versioning in place

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,400
if you need it you at least know okay

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,210
well I have things locked down and

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,670
things won't get worse at least now that

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,080
I'm in charge so now let's make things

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,330
better

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:58,860
so let's come up with some plans for

00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:01,049
improvement plans like plural multiple

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,759
plans it's not just like

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:06,239
one thing one road that's gonna lead

00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,529
exactly to success right so things are

00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,909
gonna change requirements are gonna

00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:09,509
change timelines are gonna change but

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,739
that's okay

00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,330
you should be able to roll with the

00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:16,919
punches that way but just make some

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:18,869
plans so this is what I would say is it

00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,940
good just if you've never had to do this

00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:22,519
before a really good breakdown of how to

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,769
manage that

00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:28,950
so as you're you know auditing these

00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:33,090
accounts and everything like that look

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,859
for ways to optimize so optimizing can

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,019
sometimes mean performance optimizing

00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,249
making things faster but what I'm

00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,470
talking about here is more like

00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:42,690
optimized toward your goals remember

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,279
earlier on when you were clicking

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,220
through and acting like you were a

00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,289
customer and hopefully whatever the

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,210
product is or whatever the thing is you

00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:53,519
are a customer also in real life

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,710
hopefully you use the product it's not

00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,460
always feasible but yeah as you were

00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:02,759
doing that hopefully come up with some

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,200
goals that will try to improve that so

00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,239
like if you go and do a thing and it's

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,249
hacky and weird or if you do something

00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:10,049
that's confusing or if you see an

00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:12,090
opportunity to make something a lot lot

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:14,039
better then set some goals for how

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:17,129
you're gonna do that check on things

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:20,669
like your analytics usually that's

00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:22,109
something people have and see how you're

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,230
doing see how you're doing for the

00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:27,450
things you're trying to rank for do you

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,759
have a site map do you have all the

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,049
things you need for SEO if not maybe you

00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,489
know how to do that and if you don't you

00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,769
know maybe it's within the budget to

00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:36,210
hire someone or maybe you can read up on

00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:40,350
you know the Yoast blog and figure it

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:43,350
out or something but yeah then from

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,299
there start auditing your content itself

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,749
and say like is this good is this all

00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:50,009
written by thing you know is what's

00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:51,779
what's good and what's bad what works

00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,609
what doesn't you know what are people

00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,409
responding to on social media what are

00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:57,570
people responding to in the graphs are

00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:59,909
there anything where the ranking has

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:03,119
dropped recently or is there anything

00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:05,369
that's maybe so out-of-date that it's

00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,970
not worth keeping some stuff changes

00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:10,289
some stuff doesn't

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,769
there's also back-end changes that you

00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,210
can make

00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:15,130
remember when you were looking through

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,510
WP admin and you were judging the

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,460
last person for all of the tools that

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,200
they used and maybe you're not that way

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,240
I'm sort of imposing that on all of you

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,470
but I'm sometimes that way where I'll

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,300
look through and I'll be like I don't

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,210
like this plug-in I like this other

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:31,270
plug-in right this is now your time to

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,120
change that right and you can start

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:37,060
making changes to the theme to the meta

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:41,230
and you can even do things like a beat s

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:43,350
who's familiar with a/b testing cool so

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,250
a B testing is just the concept of

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,590
having more than one version of

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,900
something having a way to measure a

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,790
change and making a change to a group of

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,770
people so maybe you'll do a thing where

00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,390
you have one version of your site and

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,330
another version of your site usually a

00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,250
small change then a portion of your

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,960
traffic will see one thing a portion of

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,400
your traffic will see another thing then

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,590
you see who behaves differently and say

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,260
okay well when we change the

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,600
call-to-action to say this people click

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,430
on it more and that's defined as success

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,620
so we're going with that so rather than

00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,710
presuming to know everything you can

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:21,100
have your users tell you what they want

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:23,620
really useful thing very very common so

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,270
yeah and you can a lot of a lot of

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,060
companies will provide ways to do this

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,350
so yeah start testing things out start

00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,290
figuring out things and start setting

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,980
goals to where you're like ok now I know

00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:37,210
how I want to make this thing better

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,370
then once all you have all of these

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,050
bright ideas and a list and you're like

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,640
I think I know what I'm gonna do talk

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,050
with your stakeholders your stakeholders

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,790
are people who would be directly

00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,780
impacted by whatever change you're

00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:52,030
proposing right maybe that's your boss

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,560
maybe that's some of your customers

00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,880
maybe that's other people right at a

00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,630
large organization there's usually

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,400
groups of people but yeah talk to the

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,010
people who are going to be helping you

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,350
make these decisions or depending on the

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,670
structure of the company maybe the

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,700
people who have the final say on these

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,020
decisions and talk over these plans and

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,970
say hey this is a thing that I'm trying

00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,290
has anyone ever tried this before is

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,540
this a good idea is this gonna work

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:18,250
right here's why I think it's gonna work

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:22,450
all right and start working with them

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,140
and then using with their input put

00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,480
everything in order

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,610
because you can't do everything and you

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,900
can't do everything and once so even if

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,150
you have a team of people working

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,680
are you you have to decide what is most

00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,990
important if everything's important

00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,940
nothing's important so things have to be

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,920
kind of in an order of like okay first

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,360
we're gonna worry about SEO then once

00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,740
we've got that sorted then we're gonna

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,270
worry about this then we're gonna worry

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,760
about that all right so if you have

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:49,330
things in a list you can can you can

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,680
kind of create a priority of this is

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,590
what's important to the business and

00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:57,280
that's usually an easier thing for

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,780
people to agree and decide on then at

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,310
that point it's gonna be really easy to

00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,510
give people timelines it's gonna be

00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,780
really easy to work with stakeholders

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,910
and say oh yeah this thing that you

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,520
wanted I haven't forgotten about it it's

00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:11,920
thing number 37 on my list and I will

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,840
get to it on May 12th because it will

00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,570
take this long right and I have to do

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,980
all these other things before then so it

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,320
makes it easy if you have it on it less

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:24,790
and even though I have this list in a 1

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,060
to 3 really it should be 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 2

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:29,590
forever because looking for ways to

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,240
optimize and talking with stakeholders

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,060
should be this continuous process that

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,220
you're always iterating on so back when

00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,810
I said hey plans will change be able to

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,860
roll with punches this is what I mean

00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:43,780
that as you're going be ready to change

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,480
the order of those priorities be ready

00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,820
to hey say hey this is actually this

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,280
other thing is more important so that

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,640
whatever success looks like you can get

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:58,980
there as quickly as possible

00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:02,080
so now we've handed off the site we have

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,520
locked things down as much as we can we

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,620
found some things we can make better

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,350
we've made some of those things better

00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,840
and we've got kind of a long list I

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,610
might call it a backlog of things that

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:17,890
we're gonna do or a team of people are

00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,970
gonna do to make things better how are

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,370
we actually going to make these changes

00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,900
I want to talk a little bit about

00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:26,650
staging and deployment who's familiar

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,300
with this concept okay so for a few

00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,030
people that aren't staging is the

00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,220
concept of I'm going to rather than make

00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,410
a change on a live website where

00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,190
everyone can see my change as soon as I

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:42,640
can is to make a copy of your site that

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,910
only you can see or that only

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,020
the business can see right and this copy

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,660
you can make whatever changes you want

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,780
and you can even do stuff that might

00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,210
seem crazy or might seem like you know a

00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,309
little bit you're not sure about right

00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,540
because only a few people are gonna see

00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:59,980
it then you can show it to people and

00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,049
say hey here's the change that I want to

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,790
make and you can test it out yourself

00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:05,679
and try things out like maybe you're

00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,540
gonna switch a theme you don't want to

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,940
figure out if you're gonna use this new

00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,799
theme while your customers are using

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,910
your website and while everything's

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,440
working because what if you don't like

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,890
it right and you want to be able to just

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,080
in the you know in a calm collected way

00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,520
to say how do I think about this and

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,380
look at things and test things out so if

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,299
you've got this copy to work with it's

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,669
gonna be really great and then as you're

00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:29,919
actually deploying these changes then

00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:31,540
you'll know what its gonna look like

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,570
before you actually do it and then

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,490
you'll push it live and depending on the

00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,470
infrastructure hopefully there's not too

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,290
many differences between staging and

00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,630
deployment but yeah then when you

00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,799
actually push it live you'll know what

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,020
you're getting it won't be a surprise

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,059
you'll be ready for it you can even plan

00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,799
for it and say hey we're gonna make a

00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:53,620
really important change to the website

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,830
at this time everyone be ready for it

00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:59,590
right so and that kind of goes back to

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:02,980
working with stakeholders so it's not

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,270
always a big organization this is also

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,710
true if you're just working on the site

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:09,010
yourself like I just have my own

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:12,130
personal like weird rants about random

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:14,799
things website that I have and even that

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,419
I use staging on because I've got a

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,770
theme that I use and if I want to change

00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:21,910
something or if I want to test something

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:24,250
out I'm gonna do a staging plug-in or if

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,750
I'm testing out a plug-in I mean I'm

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,620
gonna put that on the staging version of

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,020
a site rather than the real thing

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,730
because if it blows up my website yeah

00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,250
blow up the copy don't blow up the real

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,520
thing right so yeah that's gonna be

00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:38,770
important there's a lot of fun ways to

00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,840
do this sometimes the staging copy will

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,960
just live on your computer sometimes

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,490
it'll be hosted there and maybe if

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,990
you're very lucky you'll inherit a

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,510
website that already has that figured

00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:52,090
out right but yeah there's a lot of ways

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,550
you can do that there's plugins you can

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,260
look for online talk to your host see if

00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,549
they have it if they don't

00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,900
just look for a plugin and use that

00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:03,070
there's a lot of really good plugins

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:04,210
that will do that for you so we've gone

00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,290
through a long list of things we've

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,910
talked about a lot of different things

00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:12,850
but before I open it up to questions

00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:15,010
last slide this does not necessarily

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:18,220
apply to everyone you can do it it'll be

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:20,230
okay don't be intimidated by there being

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,480
a million things to think about and

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,370
don't be afraid to ask for help which in

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,440
fact I was debating on actually

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,760
submitting that talk instead don't be

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,679
afraid to ask for help it's a whole

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:50,350
topic in and of itself but it's very

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:54,280
very important so any questions on

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:58,690
plugin on what to use for backups um use

00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,870
something oh yeah so so the question was

00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,460
do you need a plugin for backups and

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,830
what should be used for backups perhaps

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,450
one plug-in versus another my answer

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,669
might sound like a non answer and I

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,200
apologize use what works for you because

00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:12,340
the answer for you might be very

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,260
different than the answer for somebody

00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,150
else for some people a plug-in is going

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,380
to make perfect sense right maybe their

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,870
host doesn't do it or maybe they have

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,429
specific requirements right but that's

00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,220
why it's really important to understand

00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:25,750
it and test it out yourself and say hey

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:30,130
I like the way that the restore process

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,900
works hey I like that this works while I

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,520
work for a hosting company so I have a

00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,280
lot of trust in hosting companies I

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,370
would say yeah it's great when a host

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,710
has your backups but look into how they

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:44,169
have your backups look into what level

00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:47,020
of promises they're willing to make

00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:48,520
about those backups because well some

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,010
companies will do is they'll keep their

00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,210
own backups and maybe they didn't

00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,520
actually promise that they're gonna be

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,780
available all the time or maybe the way

00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,150
that they have it set up you can't

00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,679
decide when the backups happen right so

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,270
there's certain things that would make

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,520
sense for one person that wouldn't make

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:08,140
sense for another so try it out just try

00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,330
to try to restore it

00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,540
yeah there's definitely ways to do

00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:16,390
without a plugin like my my way of

00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:19,750
backing up on my personal site is a

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,970
script that I wrote myself and it's it's

00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,549
installed at the Linux level right and

00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,440
it just does that thing it downloads to

00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,540
a hard drive in my apartment and then it

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,910
shoots up to an s3 bucket but I'm weird

00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,040
and most people don't do that so it's

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,780
not a bad idea to do a plug-in if that

00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,670
sounds like a weird thing to do or to

00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,670
use your hosts if you trust them okay

00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,819
[Music]

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:40,030
yes yes okay let me let me repeat your

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,290
question real quick and then I will try

00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,320
to answer your question in a way that

00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:45,850
makes sense so the question was hey I've

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,280
got this process set up and it's really

00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,600
painful because my staging environment

00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,490
is very very different than my

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,110
production environment and moving

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,470
between the two is a huge hassle what do

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,370
I do

00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,370
is that kind of your question

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,510
the site that you're taking over from

00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,430
from one place okay how do I solve the

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:09,430
order of operations on moving from

00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,410
staging to production okay yeah that

00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:14,890
when you're when you're figuring out how

00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:18,100
you're gonna do it try to get your

00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:21,370
staging production your staging

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,870
environment to be as similar and close

00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,360
to your production environment as you

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,540
feasibly can a lot of times that means

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,470
host it in the same place

00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,840
sometimes the infrastructure doesn't

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,700
allow for that right that's why

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,050
sometimes you'll see weird things like

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:40,030
people testing out like you'll see on a

00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,950
random Store one product will be ten

00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,150
billion dollars it's probably that

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,260
someone's testing something and they

00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,990
don't want someone to really buy it

00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,540
right so like sometimes it's impossible

00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:51,940
but if you try to make sure that your

00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,030
testing environment is very very similar

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,710
to the production environment then that

00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,330
process is gonna be a lot smoother so

00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,640
how do you solve your problem of I'm

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:03,610
I've got one and it's hacky and weird

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,440
how do I move it over the next time you

00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:08,620
do it unfortunately it's gonna be just

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,780
as much of a headache right but once you

00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,480
do that move then start working on the

00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:16,330
next move and say okay I need a new way

00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,400
of doing this how do I at my new

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,830
production environment set up staging

00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,440
that makes sense right so ditch the old

00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,730
method and find something even if it

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,890
means it's on the same domain or

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,450
something like that find a new method

00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:30,370
that works there's plugins that do it

00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:33,880
there's hosting providers that do it

00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:35,530
there's sometimes even third party

00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,350
services that will set this up for you

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,640
right but the next one that you're about

00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,370
to do is probably going to be painful

00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,700
right but once that's done immediately

00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,740
start working on how do I get my staging

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,230
environment to be very very similar to

00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,990
my production environment and that'll

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,480
ease the process a lot much next

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,710
question I put it doesn't have to be

00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,770
just about these things but I put the

00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:02,949
main topics up there for jog memories

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,949
[Music]

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:15,619
so okay the question that was asked was

00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,119
always test your ability to restore

00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:21,340
backups is that gonna mess things up

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:25,099
hopefully not hopefully right if it does

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:28,180
hopefully not but if it does you would

00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,170
rather learn that now than later right

00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,710
then during an emergency

00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:35,359
so like yes definitely test it out but

00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,280
maybe test it out really late at night

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,030
when there's gonna be less people on the

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,400
website or maybe test it out at a time

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,760
when everyone's comfortable with it but

00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,380
yeah if you can make sure that you if if

00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,180
for example you have on-demand backups

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,010
not everyone does but if you have

00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,760
on-demand backups you can take your

00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:57,260
backup and two seconds later restore it

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,590
and nothing's changed in the meantime

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,510
or if you have a really complex way of

00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,490
doing it that's really useful sometimes

00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:08,800
you can only restore pieces of it and

00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:12,170
say restore everything but the comments

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,359
extra store everything but stuff in the

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,580
user table restore everything but this

00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:18,410
so like you can do it selectively so

00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,650
that people can still interact with the

00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:22,940
site without having to OH everything

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,940
I've done in the last ten minutes went

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,280
away I wonder what happened right so you

00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,680
know there's different ways you can get

00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,020
around that but close to the time that

00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,040
you restore it is one way but just check

00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:41,810
in to what options you have available

00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,859
last how much more time do we have ten

00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:47,650
more minutes okay we have a little bit

00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:47,650
more time okay two more questions

00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,080
cool

00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,570
we had some advice from the audience a

00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,680
recommendation for duplicator and

00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:47,110
recommendation to use staging as a means

00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,390
of testing restores and a recommendation

00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,670
that if you restore in a place other

00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,870
than your production environment

00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,320
sometimes you can chest just restores

00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:58,710
without actually impacting production

00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,710
next question

00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,410
did you say you inherit a lot of Doc's

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,380
like documentation dogs like the animal

00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:06,510
oh oh I understand

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:10,100
I understand okay they're not all gems

00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,100
is what you're saying okay

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:35,970
yeah so what you're talking about is

00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:39,750
actually almost in core it will be very

00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:42,060
soon yes and it's something we've needed

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,250
for a very long time but there's some

00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,250
complexity is the short way of saying

00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,780
that but yeah what to repeat his

00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,310
question is sometimes I inherit some

00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,020
really bad websites that have a billion

00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,940
plugins some of them they're not even

00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,400
being used there's like other things

00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,780
there's problems and to add to what you

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,790
said sometimes there can be problems

00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,590
with old versions of PHP or not

00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,880
utilizing SSL properly there are all

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,160
kinds of things that can be bad about

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,020
something that someone else built so how

00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,230
do you quickly assess all of these

00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,510
things and my answer was very quickly in

00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:15,120
core at the time of this recording it's

00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,770
not in core but it soon will be there

00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,830
will be something that will help you

00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,300
evaluate those sorts of things and it

00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,950
will say things like hey you're on an

00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,500
old version of PHP you should probably

00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:27,480
upgrade and it will say things like hey

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,950
you're not using some of these themes

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,300
that you have installed maybe you should

00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,040
get rid of them

00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,690
so that's one way to do it there's also

00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,140
other third-party plugins

00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:39,600
I've had mixed results with them about

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,780
evaluating plugins because it's really

00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,940
really difficult to programmatically

00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,920
understand what a human being meant

00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,830
right code is trying to express ideas

00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,900
most of the time and you can write code

00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,770
that tries to understand that but it's

00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,570
really hard

00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,010
so it would be conceptually very

00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,600
challenging to write something that

00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,430
would understand someone's intention or

00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,610
whether or not a plug-in is objectively

00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:04,470
good or bad especially because a lot of

00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:06,180
times most plugins especially the

00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,880
popular ones aren't objectively good or

00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:12,420
bad they're just good or bad for certain

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,430
use cases so the the thing in core is

00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,500
kind of a shortcut to that but my other

00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,240
answer is there's no perfect shortcuts

00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,860
to it sometimes you just have to go

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,040
through it and say oh gosh they're using

00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:25,230
this oh gosh they're using this but yeah

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,790
there there's definitely tools like the

00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,330
thing going in core that help mitigate

00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,330
some of that

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:39,230
is there a rule on how many plugins

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:41,490
there should be is less better there are

00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,560
there are rules people will tell you

00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:48,090
there are opinions people will have is

00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:50,190
less better my personal website has a

00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,690
lot a lot of plugins most of them were

00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:56,340
written by me and only run on my own

00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:59,250
website so like it depends the more code

00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:01,290
that has to run could sometimes in

00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,470
theory make things slower often times

00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:07,470
does but it depends some plugins are

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:10,110
actually making things faster if you

00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:12,300
have a plugin that integrates with a

00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:15,960
content delivery network or sets up

00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,610
caching that's a little bit of work for

00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,370
your web server to do with a lot of

00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:22,800
performance gain and sometimes things

00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:24,870
end up just being mission-critical to

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,280
where like yeah it might be really hard

00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:32,370
but this is the best way to do it so

00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:34,680
yeah try to avoid plugins that do that

00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:40,080
personally I try to avoid plugins that

00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:41,550
do more than they need to and if there's

00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,950
a plug-in that does one thing really

00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:48,710
well I personally tend to prefer that

00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:52,860
over a plugin that does 25 things okay

00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:55,110
but it's it's all what works for you and

00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,700
I think at that point we're out of time

00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:00,880
we're 50 minutes after the hour

00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,880
