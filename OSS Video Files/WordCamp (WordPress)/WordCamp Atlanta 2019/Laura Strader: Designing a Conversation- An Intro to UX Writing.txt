Title: Laura Strader: Designing a Conversation- An Intro to UX Writing
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	We’re all humans, right? The primary way we exchange information with each other is by having a conversation and that’s what users expect from websites and apps. Everything from lead forms to error messages are a part of the conversation. And just like a conversation, the flow of information is expected to go both ways.
In this talk, we’ll discuss the art of designing the words people see when they interact with software and how to craft a genuine conversation with your users.

hi I'm glad to be here

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,139
okay my name is Laura straighter and a

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,790
little bit about me

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,210
works for blue house for nine years

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,680
started on the phones and billing and I

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,930
love talking to our customers it was

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:25,019
just fun and so I that and then words I

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,930
love words and I feel like each word has

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,670
their own personality so if I talk about

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:38,070
words as though they're their own person

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:41,340
that's why oh I should mention that I

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,430
after you know being on the support

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,559
phones I went to on a journey writing

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,090
knowledgebase articles and like honing

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:55,800
my writing skills and then I got into

00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:00,030
writing copy for products and then moved

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,440
into UX writing and now I'm learning UX

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,320
design and it's it's an interesting

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,510
experience okay so let's start with

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,229
micro copy

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:18,180
micro copy these are the the words in

00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:20,250
interface an app that that they give huh

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,320
I can I can do words today I promise

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,280
this way okay let me look at my notes

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,409
real quick okay here's what it is they

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,710
help users accomplish a task that is

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,280
what microcopy is and for example these

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,439
are button labels and calls to action

00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,700
error messages success and confirmation

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:45,479
messages they're the hints and tooltips

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:47,430
form labels and just any any text that

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,630
they read as they're interacting with

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:55,320
your website your app your software now

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,619
if you think of microcopy as the

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,710
conversation between the company the

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,729
website and the user the person visiting

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,729
and interacting with it

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,980
think of it as a two-way conversation

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:18,519
that is happening in person

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:21,760
and this is when you can come up with

00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,879
some very interesting conversations I

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,330
call them Bork to conversations and it's

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,860
when things go seriously wrong so

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,440
imagine this these exchanges happening

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,450
with someone sitting directly in front

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:42,670
of you like this is happening right here

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:44,410
oh okay then you've clearly failed to

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,000
login so I'm going to lecture you and

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,400
give you all the things you've done

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,430
wrong you know since the third grade and

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,870
you know your teacher needs to sign this

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:59,049
note and then the time that you forgot

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:02,049
to check the terms and service checkbox

00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:03,459
and so this this little robot guy I made

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:07,720
you think you crashed the Internet

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:11,650
the Internet's fine so let's just have a

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,810
real conversation and use the words and

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,109
our websites the same way we would talk

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,810
to someone in person but first let's go

00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:22,120
over some fundamentals so the three

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,900
principles of UX writing are clear

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:29,700
concise useful clear this is where

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,519
you're consistent with names and labels

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,600
like don't refer to the same thing

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,310
different ways don't this is not the

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,560
time to bust out the thesaurus and get

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,109
creative so if you're going to call

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,389
something my account don't refer to it

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:46,989
as the account center later or your

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:49,889
profile call it my account the whole way

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:54,160
through use plain language

00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:56,620
just don't use this thesaurus here

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,720
concise keep the most important text up

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,739
front like the most important

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,959
information should be first ruthlessly

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,049
edit anything that comes after the most

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,829
important information because it's not

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:13,810
necessary the editing is necessary the

00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:17,410
fluffy stuffs not that's what I'm trying

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,870
to say okay so every word when you're

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,180
being concise every word should earn its

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,729
place it should have a reason for being

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,960
there otherwise cut it it doesn't need

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:30,139
to be there

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,870
as for useful you want your your your

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:36,530
text to help users know what to do next

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,680
where to go what they're doing where

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,199
they are the call the call to action

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,090
your buttons they need to resonate with

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,409
what's happening next where that where

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:53,210
they like be very clear with the button

00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:55,009
like saying something like get started

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,659
it's a pretty vague when it's one I

00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,520
really - or learn more that's what I

00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:03,800
really don't like it's like learn more

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:06,530
about what sorry okay and then always

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,250
ask yourself is the information relevant

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,840
right now so you only provide what the

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,060
user needs to know at that time that

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,669
that extra information that could be

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,590
useful later maybe save that for later

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:24,139
yeah so it see an example of this

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,379
okay so here's here's our first one

00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:31,759
you've got failure an authentication

00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:33,349
error has a card okay okay then clear

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,500
login error you entered an incorrect

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:39,740
password okay clear and concise wrong

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,349
password okay clear concise and useful

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,180
equals okay it's a wrong password try

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:44,870
again or forgot password so that they

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,259
can either

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,529
oh I remember I changed my password it's

00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:53,719
a new one they can try it again or no I

00:05:51,529 --> 00:06:01,759
don't remember I forgot so you've got

00:05:53,719 --> 00:06:04,340
clear concise useful so now knowing

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,710
those three principles you also need to

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,110
know your audience who you're talking to

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,099
and your audience these are the people

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,419
that are coming to your website that are

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:18,229
your visitors they're buying from you

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,620
there that's your audience and who are

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:20,509
they

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,919
why are they coming to you what are they

00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,870
seeking what are their goals knowing

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,590
your audience will help you write words

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:33,080
that resonate with them and you can find

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,120
words that are familiar that they're

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,690
looking for and speak their language if

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,690
you know your audience

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,449
click it quickie there we go so voice

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,130
this is the perceived personality of

00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,840
your brand and this is something that

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,880
doesn't change day to day like your

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,990
personality doesn't change day to day so

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:59,150
it's really pretty consistent and voice

00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:02,000
so when when you're reading and like

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:05,419
interacting with an app or a website you

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,800
hear those words in your head and it it

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,460
sounds like a person you start to

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,520
personify

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:15,789
the voice and and like get a sense of

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:20,210
this personality and this is what voices

00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:22,580
and voice is what makes content and your

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,490
copy all sound the same like it all came

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,699
from the same person and if if your

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,889
voice is your personality is changing

00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,080
place to place then it sounds like

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:37,070
you've got multiple personalities yeah

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,620
it can cause some fun problems for a

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,770
personal personality I really recommend

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:46,250
using contractions and writing in an

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:50,289
active voice so meaning instead of

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:53,449
saying let's see what's a good example

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:56,510
we know what contractions are but do not

00:07:53,449 --> 00:08:00,919
do this thing it's like don't do this

00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:02,810
thing or you know just like we talked in

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,389
contractions we talk in very

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:09,349
straightforward not passive passive

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:11,840
meaning like you have been then uh like

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:15,380
no you have like if you talk in these

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,039
active voices voices it's fine we're

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:23,090
good so if you talk with an active voice

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:26,060
and using contractions it'll be easier

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,820
for your readers to connect and read it

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,139
and it will sound more natural and more

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,680
personable

00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:38,209
now tone this is something that varies

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:40,399
depending on context so it changes

00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,709
depending on the situation you have your

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,200
your voice your personality that is

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:46,880
consistent and then you adjust your tone

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,940
like if you're talking to your friend

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,260
you're giving bad news well you're going

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,070
to choose you're going to be more

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,740
subdued

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:59,990
choose careful words and try to soften

00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,520
things if you're giving good news you're

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,610
going to be excited you're gonna choose

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,740
happier words and you're gonna show the

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:11,990
enthusiasm in the words that this is

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:14,210
tone so voice is what you say tone is

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,090
how you say it here are some examples

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,200
like with error messages your users are

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,480
gonna be they're going to be confused

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,230
stressed maybe angry so you want to be

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,870
gentle serious reassuring with the tool

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,450
tip you know they're they're looking for

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,840
more information and they're inquisitive

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,340
unsure but interested so you want to be

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,030
straightforward and helpful just to the

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,860
point with with a product description

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:43,940
that you're trying to like show off its

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,860
qualities and with that you your users

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,360
like out of state where they're hopeful

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,010
they're curious they're inquisitive

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,050
they're looking for something to solve a

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,900
problem so you want to be informative

00:09:51,050 --> 00:10:01,340
and helpful and enticing and this is

00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:03,170
your tone so as the user progresses like

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:08,390
I should start with user flow and

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:12,380
content first design what this is so a

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:16,850
user flow is the steps from the first

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:23,000
task to the next the next and on until

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:24,440
they are done meeting their goal and the

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,090
conversation that you're having with

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,400
your user should flow from one step to

00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,500
the next you should consider where they

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,370
came from and where they're going next

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:46,460
as the words are going through your

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:49,580
design your website all right so let's

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:53,510
have an example so here here's how you

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:56,180
can imagine a conversation this is the

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,940
website side here's our user setup your

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,910
site what's the name of your site it's

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,170
Ashley's pet shop great next create an

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,580
account wouldn't user name would you

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,470
like to use type in the password

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,029
now set your password something secure

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,220
but memorable he'll need to make changes

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:15,690
to your site and it's it's just this

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,990
fluid exchange that the just if if I

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,459
were asking Ashley in person that's how

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,740
it would happen it's like hey Ashley

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:26,100
what's the name of your site oh this is

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,029
the name of my site that's great we need

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,370
to create an account

00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,110
what username do you want to use I want

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,480
to use this awesome

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,850
okay we need to set a password make sure

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,390
it's memorable that's how you would talk

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:46,620
to your friend so it's the same with

00:11:39,390 --> 00:12:01,680
this so how'd it get better at UX

00:11:46,620 --> 00:12:10,589
writing and writing these yes yes you're

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:12,620
right absolutely it is very important

00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:15,270
too

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,370
especially with the culture like you're

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:21,750
saying and not everybody speaks the same

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,579
language to understand that like who who

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,329
you're writing for who your audience is

00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:30,089
and you're not you don't have to write

00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:33,750
for everyone if you know your audience

00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:36,180
you can narrow that focus and just worry

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,250
about you have to worry about it because

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,170
you've got this like you can you can

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,570
focus on that conversation and that

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,430
interaction instead of trying to write

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,890
to every single person in the entire

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:52,380
world and that's where you get a lot of

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:54,390
the the more I feel like when you don't

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,089
know your audience and you write to

00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,589
everyone you have more words and more

00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,870
confusion because you're trying to cover

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,100
too many things but you know your

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,949
audience you bring it right down you've

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:10,640
you've got your personal conversation so

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:14,880
with that in mind knowing your audience

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,680
how you can start practicing this is pay

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,420
attention to the words that you see in

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,310
apps

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,440
and websites that you're interacting

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,510
with and when you like a phrase or just

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,570
feel like you know what that that was

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,950
easy what I just did

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,710
write those words down save it for later

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,990
because because that's a sign that you

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,830
know you found something that was good

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:39,590
and you can just pay attention make note

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:41,750
then another thing I like to do is

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,340
simplify complex ideas you can start

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:48,890
with one that you're already like super

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:53,600
super familiar with and and then try and

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:55,220
explain it and very concisely using 140

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,370
characters or less it's a game I like to

00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,280
play where it's like okay can I take

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,970
this this topic and just explain it and

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,170
harm 40 characters and and then test it

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,710
so you see if someone else can

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,960
understand it and read it and and then

00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,700
you can move on to you know trying other

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,400
ideas and see if you can like understand

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,400
it well enough to but just practice it

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,850
another way is map and existing user

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,290
flow then rewrite it this is very

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,290
similar to paying attention to the words

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,710
what you can do is is as you're going

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,660
through websites and interacting like

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:39,590
just maybe take screenshots of the whole

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,240
flow and then rewrite it rearrange it

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,700
reimagine it be like you know what how

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,940
could this have gone better and then

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,400
practice imagining like okay I'm going

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,080
to rewrite this imagining myself talking

00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:59,300
to my friend I'll be the side that will

00:14:51,080 --> 00:15:03,800
be that side and we'll talk so while I

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,130
went through this fast so we can talk

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:12,560
about a lot more though

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:14,540
in conclusion overall the idea is we can

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,320
talk like the words we use in our

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:22,160
websites we can absolutely like it's

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,960
okay to break some grammar rules like

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,080
you don't have to be strict with it be

00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,380
the human right make it sound personable

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,190
have that conversation and like don't

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,870
hide behind those

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,830
those the technical words and the

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:44,390
corporate jargon just yourself and it's

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:47,170
it's okay so yeah questions comments

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,170
