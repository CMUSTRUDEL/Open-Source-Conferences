Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	We’re all humans, right? The primary way we exchange information with each other is by having a conversation and that’s what users expect from websites and apps. Everything from lead forms to error messages are a part of the conversation. And just like a conversation, the flow of information is expected to go both ways.
In this talk, we’ll discuss the art of designing the words people see when they interact with software and how to craft a genuine conversation with your users.
