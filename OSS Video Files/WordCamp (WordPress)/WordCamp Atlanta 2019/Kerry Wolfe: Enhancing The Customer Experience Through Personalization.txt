00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,450
Carrie wolf

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,120
I run a wordpress developer agency

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,309
called WP wolf press and I'm really

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,219
excited to share some stuff with you two

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,219
not to deceive me this afternoon that is

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,199
kind of it's pretty new and some of it

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,850
is actually not even out yet and it has

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,869
to do with the our ability to

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:33,200
personalize our websites on a customer

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:36,750
by customer by customer basis so as is

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,170
the norm will tuck I guess a little bit

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,170
about me

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,690
that's the home team being my wife my

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,010
lovely wife but we don't have any

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,430
children but we do have a chief security

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,820
officer named Sophia that she makes sure

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,460
that all the that everything's handled

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,359
security was at the hot at the house I

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:13,350
work from home been building websites

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:15,030
since 1995 and did that until about 2002

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,830
and then I found an image ennis design

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:23,070
works which reserves sure found an image

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,830
ennis image enos's design works which

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,080
was sort of an all-purpose design agency

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,780
we did websites we did graphics we did

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:38,490
logos we did everything and in 2012 I

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,610
discovered WordPress found that I could

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,720
do so much more and I decided to focus

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:49,579
on that and rebranded as theirs WP wolf

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:53,869
press in 2017 and we do exclusively just

00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:53,869
WordPress related material

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:02,040
our current sort of motto if you will is

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,560
and everything we do we believe everyone

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,100
deserves to be listened to and treated

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,880
like a real human person thus providing

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,010
a uniquely remarkable personalized

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,340
customer experience those last four

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,720
words you're gonna hear a lot today

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,890
well we'll cover will cover we'll cover

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,800
why we're here today

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,820
brief history of personalization what is

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,739
personalization done right why should

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:33,900
you care how can you get started today

00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,709
how do we do this how can

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,330
personalization impact your business and

00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:46,190
then how can you sell this to your

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:50,100
customers this is how I got here today a

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:54,030
couple of months ago I was at Walmart

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,040
that's where we shop and it's kind of

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,020
you know we were all sounds with the

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,660
Chuckle I get that everybody has had

00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:05,130
this experience and you know you're

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:08,700
thinking this they just don't care they

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,560
treat us like cattle and now and this

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,510
but you know and then they can say well

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
go shop somewhere else it's where the

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,880
cheapest and so people do it but it

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:23,130
makes you feel like you just don't

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:26,330
matter and that's not a good feeling we

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,330
also have this experience

00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:36,590
interminably put on hold go to the

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,510
doctor's office wait you have an

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,500
appointment of one o'clock you don't get

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:46,190
seen till 4:00 I've often been tempted

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,440
to send them a bill for my time three

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,750
hours of my time at what I bill at for

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,990
that waste of time so this is the way

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,560
that we've come to be used to be treated

00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:00,410
and we're just treated like a nameless

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,080
entity instead of a human person we're

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:08,600
treated like a prospect an email address

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:12,370
a phone number a demographic but one

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,739
size does not fit all although they try

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm a tall person I can't go to Cole's

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:21,350
and buy large shirts because the sleeves

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,950
come to here myself but we've been

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,350
trained to believe this

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:33,290
and it's through this mass marketing

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:35,630
that we've kind of evolved into we have

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,180
average projects products for average

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,330
people and the products are designed to

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,930
be average because if you want to market

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:48,110
to mass markets you have to find

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,479
something the masses want and that's

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,000
average but we don't want to feel

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:58,340
average we want to feel different

00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:03,250
special paid attention to but we've been

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,250
trying to accept this for hundred years

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,550
Henry Ford famously said any customer

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,470
can have a car painted any color he

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:14,600
wants so long as it's flat and if you

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,930
don't fit into this box we can't help

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:23,020
you so the thing is if we're selling to

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:26,770
everybody we're selling to nobody

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:30,430
so it's time for change Karen Kathy

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,260
Sierra said years ago when it comes to

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,470
your features and even your benefits one

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:39,370
size does not fit all try to find ways

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:42,420
to connect what you what you do have to

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:47,380
what each individual finds personally

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,810
meaningful and then we're going to go to

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,700
what I call the dawn of personalization

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:57,370
does anybody know who Howard mark

00:05:51,700 --> 00:06:03,100
Moskowitz is Howard Moskowitz I'll let

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:05,560
you read that he was a research marketer

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:09,130
and he was hired by Campbell Soup

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:15,190
Company because they had a problem they

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:18,250
had a pasta sauce that they made his cup

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,710
of prego and they were trying to compete

00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,960
with ragu and they were getting killed

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,430
by a ragu and they said we came to this

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,290
guy we got to figure out how to make

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,090
something better so we need you to do

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:33,580
some market research and find out what

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:36,100
people want so he sent he did all kinds

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,350
of surveys all over the country he bust

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,780
in truckloads of people and put ten

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,460
bowls of pasta sauce out with different

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,330
kinds of sauce 40 something different

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:50,350
kinds of sauces you know spicy sweet

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:55,090
playing chunky salty garlicky all

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:56,800
different kinds and he discovered when

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,580
we looked at the data usually they were

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,160
expecting a nice bell curve but there

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,290
was a mess the data was a mess it was

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,610
all over the place but he did recognize

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:13,270
that they fell into three clusters they

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,570
fell into their people those are those

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,790
who like pasta sauce plain there are

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,900
those who like it chunky and those that

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,900
like it spicy and

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,669
that time no one made chunky spike a big

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,490
sauce for pasta sauce so they started

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,900
making chunky it's a pasta sauce took

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,290
over 30 percent of the market

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,080
made six hundred million dollars so that

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,570
was the beginning of the personalization

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,910
of sort of segmenting the market as it

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:50,180
said in here he's known for horizontal

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:54,110
segmentation but being Americans

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:57,840
anything worth doing is worth overdoing

00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:00,690
and this is what we have today I every

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,200
Christmas make a chocolate caramel

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:07,320
cheesecake and it requires an Oreo Oreo

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,370
cookie crust so I go to the Walmart and

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,940
I try to get Oreo cookies plain Oreo

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:20,220
cookies you ever tried to find plain

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:22,260
Oreo cookies this is a shot just a week

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,570
or two ago from my local Walmart of the

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,710
Oreo cookie section and I couldn't get

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,160
it all in and I didn't have a wide-angle

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:33,390
lens but that part in a circle those are

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,430
the regular Oreo sitting but they have

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,740
121 choices of Oreo cookies

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,599
they have 262 choices of ranch dressing

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,969
first I said well what come any

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,760
dressings but it was over a thousand so

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:48,450
I didn't stop counting 121 different

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:54,020
variations of Coca Cola 137 variations

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:57,000
of cured cups Wow

00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:03,200
choice it isn't all it's cracked up to

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,200
be because there's the paradox of choice

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,220
choices made us not furrier but more

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,820
paralyzed not happier but more

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:14,790
dissatisfied the Purdue produces a

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,580
paralysis rather than a liberation with

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,860
so many options to choose from what we

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,290
find it difficult to choose the

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,790
experience dissatisfaction if you

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,790
overcome the paralysis and make a choice

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,410
you end up less satisfied because of the

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,410
result of the choice that we would have

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,399
made if we have had to your options to

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,100
choose from

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,259
and then this is the like the most

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,230
important one the escalation of

00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:45,629
expectations when there are so many

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:49,199
choices one should be perfect but when

00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:52,430
we get good or we get great we're

00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:55,649
disappointed because it's not perfect

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,389
and I've had that expected experience

00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,059
I recently repainted in my office and

00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:02,990
you ever go to Lowe's or Home Depot and

00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:07,670
to take a paint chip there's millions

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:10,079
and so you try to let's go to

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,420
bluish-gray air yeah

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,980
so now it's only a hundred so then you

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,870
go and you pick it so we painted the

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,019
room and that and then when you look at

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,809
Isis I don't like it

00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:26,040
but you know I'm not gonna repaint the

00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:28,980
room so so what is personalization done

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:34,350
right it's listening to your customers

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:36,779
and having a relevant conversation it's

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,839
knowing and responding to the person not

00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:43,889
to the email address this is a change of

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:48,569
mindset a lead is in person not an email

00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:51,329
address with a problem and you are there

00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:53,939
to solve it it's about developing human

00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:56,929
relationships with your customers your

00:10:53,939 --> 00:11:01,139
customers feeling well understood

00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:05,660
feeling well understood your customers

00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:07,379
feeling you care about them

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,629
personalization is the pathway to

00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:13,110
remarkable I told you we'd come up on

00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:15,300
remarkable again remarkable is

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,920
surprising and delighting a customer by

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,949
exceeding their expectations and

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,319
creating a positive emotional reaction

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:25,829
that compels them to tell others about

00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:27,660
their experience you ever had that ever

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,910
had that happened or somebody gives you

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,160
just such a great experience that you

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:36,259
just got to go out and tell your friends

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:41,120
that's remarkable and that's invaluable

00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:43,350
it's common parlance is word-of-mouth

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,650
but what's all this talk about feelings

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:51,540
why does it matter anybody ever seen the

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:53,250
talk by simon Sinek it's about finding

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,710
your wife kind of stuff he talks about

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,020
this it talks about the limbic brain

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:01,680
limbic brain is responsible for all our

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:04,290
feelings like loyalty and Trust it's

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,230
responsible for all human behavior all

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:10,710
decision-making and it has no capacity

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,440
for language that's where our gut

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,600
decisions come from never had a thing

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,300
but somebody gigas and comes to you and

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,060
they say well it just doesn't feel right

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,770
you know other than if it you know at

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,650
all well paper it looks good but it just

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:29,160
doesn't feel right well we're not

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:31,200
talking to the right person inside we're

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,900
talking to the up here we're not talking

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,450
in there so we got to make the person

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,340
feel like they're being understood and

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,970
they're being heard they're being

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,040
listened to so how can we listen well

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,220
and this is on now we're talking into

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,250
the dealing with the website we pay

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,680
attention to how they found your website

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,830
did do a Google search what were they

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,410
searching for Facebook ad link from

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,450
other sites where did they land on your

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,340
website they landed on your website

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,280
about Web Design maybe they're

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,870
interested in web design what page is in

00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,480
posted of you maybe they went back to

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,160
multiple pages more than one time maybe

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,740
there that shows that they're interested

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,900
in that you can ask them questions you

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,300
have those little pop-up toasters to say

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,790
what kind of business do you have what

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,430
stages are you at your business how can

I best serve you or the biggest

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,720
challenges you're having in your

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:32,250
business today yeah you can ask they

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,750
don't have to answer but you can ask if

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,910
you get five 10 percent people

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:40,200
are answering you can making some

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,670
headway why should you care 71 percent

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,690
of customers get frustrated with

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,010
impersonal shopping experiences 67

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,740
percent of customers have unsubscribed

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:53,040
from lists because the emails will were

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,769
irrelevant I get emails from the people

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,290
that I don't know

00:13:53,769 --> 00:14:01,660
we are or I buy stuff for my wife at

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,269
Christmas from some obscure jewelry

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,869
company and for the next two years I get

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:10,509
emails from them so I have to delete

00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:12,989
them 44% of customers are likely to

00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:17,619
become repeat buyers after a

00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:20,709
personalized shopping experience very

00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:23,649
important personalization is good for

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:26,499
the customer conversations are more

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:30,489
relevant what you have to say to them

00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:33,399
means something to they feel better

00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:36,939
understood they feel like this this

00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,730
company or this person they get me they

00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:41,889
create more meaningful relationships and

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,879
this is very valuable because we because

00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:45,879
there's always gonna be somebody it's

00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,709
going to be try to sure what the term to

00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,290
think users they're gonna try to poach

00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:53,559
your customers but if they have a

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:57,009
relationship with you even if the people

00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,720
come in cheaper you're gonna say no I

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,230
think I'm going to stay with so-and-so

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,990
and that's a decision being made by the

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,319
limbic brain it feels right because of

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:12,069
their experience with you and it creates

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:16,829
a remarkable customer experience it's

00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:18,759
good for you as the as the web developer

00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:20,589
because now you have more engaged

00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,410
customers they listen to what you have

00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:25,629
to say you have earned credibility

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:29,860
they're more likely to buy from you you

00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:33,429
have continued nurturing they buy again

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,939
and again and again lifetime value of a

00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:40,439
customer goes up high and they become

00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:46,100
your evangelists they become your tribe

00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:50,489
the tribes are very loyal I promise you

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:53,309
this is not what personalization is it

00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:54,629
was it's what it used to be it's what

00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:56,339
they used to tout or we can you know we

00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:58,699
can put their first name right at the

00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,139
top of the email that's pretty fancy

00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:03,529
that's not what personalization is about

00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,059
and it's not about this

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,230
it's not about spying in people or

00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:11,459
following around the Internet

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:14,579
it's not about being creepy just to make

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:18,809
that clear so how do you get started

00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:20,910
well we start with persona grafts when

00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:23,069
it comes to benefits you offer one size

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,290
doesn't fit at all so we like personna

00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:28,290
graphs because they help us put a story

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,470
on top of the sales process now a lot of

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:34,499
times you've heard of personas but if

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,829
you take a persona and put a story with

00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:41,669
it you have a persona graph like a

00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:43,739
biography and the the story you're

00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:46,290
talking about is this story that the

00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:50,249
customer tells themselves about

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:54,029
themselves and that's how they get the

00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:56,609
feeling that you understand them and to

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:58,259
start out based on you can do the

00:16:56,609 --> 00:17:00,720
starter persona graphs based on existing

00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,480
clients that you know clients do you

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,980
think you might like to attract and

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,909
build out a couple of persona graphs to

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,409
start with just to the man and a woman

00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,419
if you've already developed persona

00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:15,000
graphs great this will help you get a

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:19,079
great start here's a couple of starter

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,689
persona graphs completely made-up but

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:26,459
sort of sort of based on past

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:29,190
experiences and we kind of pick out some

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:33,539
things that might be helpful to how to

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:39,139
interact with them and so particularly

00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:40,769
paying attention to needs and goals now

00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:43,440
what we're going to be talking about

00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:45,720
tonight or this afternoon is going to

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,250
require some tools

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,890
it's gonna require an email service

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,360
provider and what the email service

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,930
provider I'm not really talking

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,940
something like Constant Contact or

00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:01,800
others they just send emails these are

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,200
more robust email automation type

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:08,250
platforms

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:13,200
well not some some call themselves sort

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:16,710
of a CRM but but the most popular ones

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,890
and the word the ones that work best

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:23,480
probably for this would be convertkit

00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,480
drip activecampaign

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:32,130
those are the top ones that seem to work

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,560
best with and I'm familiar with and then

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:38,310
this the secret sauce is this a new

00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:43,550
product called write message it's been

00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,550
out about a year yes ma'am

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:52,920
do you mean do they cost right yes yeah

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:58,080
and there's varying degrees of cost

00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:00,680
depending on what's what you need you

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:06,510
can begin by gathering anonymous data

00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:08,700
with right message you can get the

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:13,680
Google search and the pages customers

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:18,830
landed on so I searched on search on

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:21,390
rest recipes for mozzarella pizza and

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,060
maybe you have a site that has recipes

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:27,540
for mozzarella pizza and it lands on

00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:30,030
your page that information is recorded

00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:34,320
we haven't assigned it to a person yet

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:37,050
but it's recorded Facebook ad clicks -

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,920
what what was the ad promoting page

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:43,860
customers what the pages customers

00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,900
navigate to multiple times like keep

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,580
coming back to the pricing page

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,800
you know what's that about are they

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,820
having some trouble figuring out the

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:57,059
price you know they about the price blog

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,410
posts they keep reading or a type of

00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:05,190
blog but maybe they're reading blog

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:06,780
posts on on content marketing you know

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,990
you can see it you begin to see a theme

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,760
in there and then of course those

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,740
mentions of toaster pop-up surveys and

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,250
questions and responses but each one of

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:21,570
these these these actions applies a tag

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:25,110
or a custom field to their record that

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:30,330
will be later applied to the email email

00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:31,679
service provider now there's a

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,550
difference between tags and custom

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,470
fields tags are things people do they

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,920
tend to be binary they're either a

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,340
subscriber or they're not a custom field

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:48,120
is it's like you can have a custom field

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:50,700
of status what is their status well that

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,410
can change you know they could be the

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,030
beginning they could be a lead and then

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,850
after you move them through your funnel

00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:00,270
they may become a warm lead and then

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:02,280
they may become a customer or them then

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:04,920
they may ask for a refund and they're a

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,890
former customer but that their status

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,870
can change so it's important when you're

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,610
setting all this stuff up to take those

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,580
into account that they're if she'd be

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,710
treated differently then you continue

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,070
gathering data once they sign up for

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,929
your lead magnet your blog post or your

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:25,080
newsletter email this in other words

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:27,360
once you get their email address all

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,400
that other stuff that we've talked about

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,809
that it was it was keeping track of is

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,480
associated with their email address and

00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:40,520
it's put into the email services

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,520
provider and it's nothing with cookies

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,840
then you can engage with customers

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:48,450
further through personalized relevant

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,890
emails and gather more data through

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,159
trigger links these triggers these links

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,499
down here when they

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,649
click on those you're there answering a

00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:59,929
question but it's also putting the tag

00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:02,179
in this in the service provider saying

00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:07,159
that what what stage are they looking

00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:09,799
for are they looking for a job and we

00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,259
continue gathering data as they further

00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:15,489
engage with your website emails you can

00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:19,159
develop a very specific persona graph

00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:21,830
and help further uncover problems and

00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,320
help them know help you know how you can

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:27,259
best help them in other words they are

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,529
better understood they feel better

00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:32,179
understood they feel like you're the

00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:34,249
only one that understands them and

00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:36,440
you're the only one that has the answer

00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:38,149
over time you can develop a granular

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,099
picture of what your customers needs are

00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:43,759
and build new products and tweak

00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:44,509
existing products to their needs now

00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,509
there's different kinds of

00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:49,429
personalizations of how you can change

00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:54,139
your website and what we're talking

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:58,789
about here is modifying a website on the

00:22:54,139 --> 00:23:02,779
fly based on the data we have on that

00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:07,279
particular customer not a segment that

00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:10,909
person's like you go to a home page you

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,710
might see a version and you go to that

00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,809
same home page and you might see a

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:19,249
different version because it's tailored

00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:22,999
specifically for you so we can do add

00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:25,519
new sections within pages crates we can

00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:28,549
change move swap out existing page

00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,090
content we can change pictures we can

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:33,590
move things from one side to the other

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,779
and as I mentioned for we can adapt the

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,799
home page to reflect a custom to

00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:42,529
visitors readiness and specific needs

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,809
now after all this data we've gathered

00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:47,539
we can have a progressively learned

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:48,549
persona graph and this is what we're

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,309
aiming for

00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:54,820
that we have a persona graph of everyone

00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:59,049
on your list that shows who they are and

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:02,649
what they need and these are three

00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:04,119
imaginary or not so imaginary some of

00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,119
the names have been changed to protect

00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,589
the innocent

00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,599
we have Roger who's a professional

00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:15,940
speaker Alison a marketer and Mike is a

00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:18,789
life coach so let's say they you know if

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,149
you come to my homepage that's pretty

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:25,529
much what it looks like above the fold

00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:29,919
but if Mike goes through that homepage

00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:35,019
it's it's different notice how it's

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:39,429
different it specifically addresses life

00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:44,709
coaches and it addresses what's his

00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:48,549
what's his main goal long term client

00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:53,159
base of loyal client base and then at

00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:56,219
the very last part it adds a sort of a

00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,829
aspirational place that they could be

00:24:56,219 --> 00:25:02,829
that is your customers experience is so

00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:08,669
remarkable they want you to lead them to

00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:11,649
success then we go on to Allison

00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:14,529
specifically online marketers helped her

00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:18,359
close more deals wait that's that was

00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:20,159
what her main goal was how'd that happen

00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,709
is it magic

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,940
you know arthur c clarke once said

00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:27,359
sufficiently advanced technology is

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,309
indistinguishable from magic

00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,049
this is we got it going on here

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,769
and then of course we can change their

00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:38,529
aspirational desire and then of course

00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:41,200
there's Roger he wants more speaking

00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:44,079
gigs and he loved it if people would be

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,950
begging him to speak at their events so

00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,889
these are things that we can do

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,559
but how do we do it now what I'm going

00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:55,169
to show you here is kind of a

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,850
combination of how we do that which I

00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:59,940
just showed you but what's coming down

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:04,440
the pipe this I'm a beta tester for the

00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:08,970
software and this is called a call to

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:12,859
action widget so this is on this would

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:15,179
be on website development page and

00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:17,609
you'll see this little pop-up toaster

00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,639
that comes up that asked about what

00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:23,429
industry they're in and you barely see

00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:26,970
it here but coaching is slightly darker

00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:28,830
because it's been clicked so they click

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:33,259
there in look they're in the coaching

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:38,369
industry and it asks what role they are

00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:43,159
they're the owner ok so now they get a

00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:46,590
they get a free ebook talking about how

00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:51,119
to develop a remarkable website project

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:56,090
so they click on get their new book they

00:26:51,119 --> 00:27:02,730
click on Cindy mice my stuff and then

00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:06,830
they get their their stuff now this is

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:09,210
what the landing page look tight before

00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:12,929
with this up this widget I just showed

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:17,179
you all that data collected on the fly

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:20,159
when they went to that landing page or

00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:26,779
that particular person the owner of a

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,779
consulting business they will go ahead

00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,420
that's what they'd see but how do we get

00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:36,370
there

00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:37,570
go back so I'm here in the what we're

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:45,280
going to show you now is the inside of

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:47,850
right message we can go in these are the

00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,880
ones not working

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,880
Oh

00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,760
okay

00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:04,710
y'all hit me now that makes it one I

00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:04,710
don't know

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:14,649
okay okay seven the little red part

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,629
there's this free guide we are in the

00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:20,879
interface now to where we're editing so

00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:20,879
we're going to edit that beforehand just

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,359
see what it says consulting we're

00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:36,869
editing the consulting consult segment

00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:39,149
so we're going to change it to say free

00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:41,519
guide for consultants and this will pop

00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:44,029
up on the rights what's doing it then

00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,549
we're gonna head it for the owner

00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:51,450
segment and we're gonna hit this area

00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:53,639
down here and this is how we do it using

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:58,320
this little doohickey and then we've

00:28:53,639 --> 00:29:01,470
changed it to that so now there's what

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,350
the page normally looks like if somebody

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,869
fills out that form and they are a owner

00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,779
of a consulting business that's what

00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:12,049
they see they see free guide for

00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:15,989
consultants a remarkable website project

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:18,690
looks is a collaboration between

00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:20,309
business owner and designer these are

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,489
just some simple examples of how it can

00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:25,649
be used now all that stuff being said

00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:28,639
all this data is recorded in the email

00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:31,129
service provider as we can see here

00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:35,730
their industry this is a custom field

00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:40,830
this consulting role owner they've added

00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:42,539
a tag for the project and then in this

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,970
particular we're talking about websites

00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:49,799
mostly here but this also dumps them

00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:52,710
into an automation and and this is in

00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:57,509
this is an active campaign automation if

00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:59,789
they're already a customer they're

00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:02,429
already a customer they just come down

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,230
here and get the email and say thank you

00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:05,999
and here's your download if they're not

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,239
a customer there you go through these an

00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:11,039
archer sequence that goes over period

00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:13,889
without a week where they get emails

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,389
that go over all the different better

00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:18,570
the benefits and so on and so forth

00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:22,919
until they get a sort of a hey you want

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:26,609
to buy copy mail so so this is how that

00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,509
works can Howard can personalization

00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:30,359
impact your business

00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:33,389
well okay steady saw me being familiar

00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:38,360
with Pat Flynn he's very popular very

00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:44,010
successful he did they implemented

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:48,060
this tool last Christmas and back then

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:50,490
it was this is this is one of those

00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,340
toaster widgets and he actually had I

00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,930
think five questions he asked but by

00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,660
implementing this and gaining more

00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:02,430
information about his customers during

00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:06,140
his blackness Cyber Monday sale he

00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:09,570
increased his sales 138 that 138 percent

00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,430
he raised in raised another earned

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:14,090
another hundred and four thousand

00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:17,690
dollars in revenue just by doing this

00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:21,840
and there's no bubble case studies to

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:25,890
like this to bring this up so how do you

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,680
sell it when customers when you go out

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:31,920
and have to sell in person you gotta

00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:37,140
make a call do the whole dog-and-pony

00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:38,670
show that takes time takes money but for

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,580
me I don't know about you but time is

00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:45,000
the most valuable thing I have imagine

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:49,590
doing that a thousand times go out and

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,390
do it a thousand times and then have

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,310
your website do it a thousand times for

00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:57,410
you

00:31:53,310 --> 00:32:00,240
that's a lot of hot times time savings

00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,290
but when you're going through when

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,970
you're working when you go do it

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,560
yourself you're profiling a person

00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,300
you're asking like you're learning about

00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,200
it you can see how the act that can kind

00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,010
of get a sense of who they are

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,250
well the website can do that for you but

00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,690
without the right tools when you're

00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:19,140
online you're forced to come up with the

00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:23,970
lowest common denominator copy and

00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:26,070
messaging your going for average they're

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,050
selling to everybody and when you're

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,260
selling to everybody you're selling to

00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:32,310
nobody

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,010
another way to sell it's the future

00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,350
benefit retailers like Amazon and other

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,000
companies are already doing this kind of

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,160
thing but they're doing it on a huge

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,860
scale with artificial intelligence and

00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:48,960
they get creepy I'm looking a book on

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,210
Amazon it follows me all over the

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,490
Internet

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,440
this used to require a lot of custom

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,210
engineering now it's achieved Chiba

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,320
Bolivia off-the-shelf software with

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:05,190
right message I was looking at a report

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,620
a couple of months ago that adobe has a

00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,410
product called Dobie experience manager

00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,240
that does a lot of this kind of stuff

00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:15,810
that do it with WordPress but was does a

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,690
lot of this kind of stuff and the

00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:22,370
starting starting the the range of cost

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:24,750
is between 250,000 and a billion dollars

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,900
this doesn't cost two hundred fifty

00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:32,340
thousand dollars or billion dollars I

00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:35,370
think right message is like 50 $60 a

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:40,620
month and then to me

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:45,190
whoops back well lose my

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:49,150
there we go to me this is key the future

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:51,250
is personal their future is personal

00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,020
that says it best

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:56,950
another way consents the awareness

00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,930
benefit by doing all this gathering data

00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,780
you're doing in source marketing you're

00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,130
a better understanding who and whether

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,840
you're engaging with of course we talked

00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,520
about Pat Flynn and by better

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,440
understanding your audience you increase

00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,520
loyalty and engagement and you're able

00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:15,070
to make your content more relevant and

00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,679
then I mentioned this just don't forget

00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:21,070
the personal touch this is a personal

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,200
story I used to waste in California and

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:26,970
I was married before and when my first

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:30,760
wife was going for a new job

00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:32,410
she went to Nordstrom's and this is

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,300
before Nordstrom Nordstrom's used to be

00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:36,130
up in north like Seattle or somewhere

00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:40,090
and they had come down to California and

00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:42,460
they or even Macy's lunch and so she

00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:46,030
went to Nordstrom's and they assigned

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,620
her a personal shopper that sat down

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,850
with her and say okay what kind of

00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,270
clothes do you like and tell me about

00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,560
this job you're going for and you know

00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,460
what kind of budget do you have what

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,240
colors do you like

00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:01,060
and all that kind of stuff and then Beth

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,940
went home came back a week later this

00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:06,340
lady had all these outfits hanging up

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,540
with the shoes and the bags everything

00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:13,600
matching and everything and so she

00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,600
picked one out and when she went to the

00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,180
job interview she got the job when that

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:24,040
personal shopper found out she sent her

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:26,290
a congratulatory bouquet of flowers that

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,210
is a personal touch and we can do small

00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,350
thing that's a there I don't know if I

00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,570
