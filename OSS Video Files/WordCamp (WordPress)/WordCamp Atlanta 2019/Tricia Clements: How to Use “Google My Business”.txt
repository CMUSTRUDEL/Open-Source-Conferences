I'm Trisha Clemons and I'm a social

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,220
media manager and marketer I also do

00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,250
reputation management online for

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,900
businesses and my business is muffets

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:19,020
comm and I specialize in pet businesses

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,740
hence the mutt buds here's some

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,730
information where you can find me online

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:27,720
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:32,309
Google my business Google my business is

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,960
a core component of local SEO so the

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,129
first thing is really quickly what's

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,770
local SEO SEO search engine optimization

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:43,350
getting found online

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:47,039
local SEO is when you're targeting a

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,500
specific geographic location so for

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,350
instance this here is my little girl

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,110
Margie she often grabs my phone and

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,239
searches for dog treats near me she's

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,359
not looking for dog treats in New York

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,680
or in Texas or in Florida she wants some

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,809
really close because she knows that

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,729
she's gonna have to walk there and get

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,770
those she's not gonna be able to get on

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,970
a plane or get in my car I'm not gonna

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,850
give her the car key she's gonna be

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,040
really close so that's local SEO if you

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,540
do targeting a specific geographic

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,820
location one thing is to remember 71

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,270
percent of customers look to confirm the

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,250
address online before actually going to

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,530
a store for the first time so it's

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,420
extremely important here's another I've

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,030
got a few different statistics you can

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,390
read over them a few of the key ones 46

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,030
percent of all searches on Google are

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:43,520
local 18 percent of local mobile

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,390
searches lead to a sale within one day

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,329
seventy-five percent of smartphone

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,970
owners they use that Google search list

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,860
first so this you can just review over

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,850
some of those as well and take a look at

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,189
that Google my business is really

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,159
crucial for a small business that's

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,530
targeting a local geographic area it's

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,689
how you get found in the searches how

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,550
you get found in the Google map searches

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,520
you've got to have your information

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,290
correct if your information is not

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,700
correct you will come up lower in the

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,709
searches you've got to have that

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,780
information correct Google will find out

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,720
if it's not you will come up lower in

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,080
the searches also this is where your

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,700
Google reviews are extremely important

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,440
we're going to talk a lot more in depth

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,599
about that a little bit later the

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,530
reviews but that's extremely extremely

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,170
important for your business so the

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,750
Google 3-pack again I said Margie's

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,209
looking for dog treats near me this is

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,370
what she's gonna find earlier if you

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,319
were here during Jenny Munz talk she was

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,870
talking about when you do a search on

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,510
Google you have ads come up and then

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,849
you'll have the map this is a lot of

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,730
times people call it the 3-pack snack

00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,800
pack and you have the top three searches

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,200
that come up and then at the bottom you

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,989
can hit more places it's got a map so

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,780
that is the Google 3-pack that's really

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:09,930
what a lot of people are the goal is to

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,450
get up into the 3-pack and as far as how

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,580
easy or hard it is to get into that

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,769
three packet really depends on the

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,040
industry how competitive your industry

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,440
is in your area as to how quickly you

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,860
can get up into that 3-pack and also

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,810
then you've got to stay there the Google

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,970
knowledge panel Google my business the

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,190
knowledge panel it looks different on a

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,450
cell phone just like all searches things

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,670
look different on a cell phone and than

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,230
they do on the desktop so you just need

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,269
to be aware of that when you're logging

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,190
into your Google my business account and

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,900
you're changing things you want to make

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,299
sure how it's going to look and come up

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,069
on the desktop versus the mobile it's

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,519
got different information you'll see on

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:54,150
the mobile right there call save message

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,280
you've got on there's the menu which is

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,970
different services and things and you'll

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,939
notice the menu all that service is

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,799
there that comes up only on mobile so if

00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,080
you're inputting services that will only

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,640
come up on mobile that doesn't come up

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,200
when you're look

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,700
the desktop so if you're entering things

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,980
and you're wondering why don't see them

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,310
check your mobile device and look and

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,709
see if you find them there okay

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,590
look at my business the first thing you

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,810
need to do is a small business or any

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,700
type of business is to set up and claim

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,120
your Google my business account you're

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,980
gonna do that at business google.com

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,270
make sure you've gone there set up or

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,980
claim your Google my business account

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:40,520
it's going to allow you to tell Google

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:43,760
your seasonal hours your holiday hours

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,680
let's see we've got Memorial Day coming

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,060
up later this month if you're going to

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,340
be closed that day or have different

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,900
hours that day you need to put that in

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,090
Google so when someone's coming in

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,370
searching they know that you have

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,640
different hours on that specific Monday

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,940
you can input your images there you're

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,610
going to also input reply to reviews you

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,290
can add events if you've got a store and

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,060
you've got a pop of it something going

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,860
on or a big special that's where you

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,440
need to put this as in your Google my

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,330
business account it's where you really

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,330
are going to have direct contact with

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:21,290
your customers so again it's extremely

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:23,090
extremely important now mirja gets

00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,460
really upset when someone else has

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,270
claimed your account she really doesn't

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,520
like it I have seen this time and time

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,100
again with small businesses that come to

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,729
me and say I want help with my Google

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,190
account and say okay so let's look at

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,870
the account make me a manager I'll come

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,240
go in and look at it they say I have no

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,830
idea and I can see that their account

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,910
has been claimed but they don't have

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,750
access to it

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,880
so that is why you really need to make

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:57,229
sure that you claim your account

00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:00,620
yourself it you can if someone else has

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:03,350
claimed it you can reclaim it it takes

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,080
time and effort and it's not going to be

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:10,160
immediate so you do need to make sure

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,710
you own it if you don't get get control

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,320
of it again

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,100
own it you

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,480
have to be the owner so let's say for

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,050
instance you have an employee that's

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,590
maybe managing your account well that's

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,730
fine they can manage it it's just kind

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,830
of similar when you think of like

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,840
Facebook you have admins and managers

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,480
different roles the same with Google you

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,490
have an owner and then you have managers

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,550
make sure it's the business owner you're

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,590
the owner of that account employees as

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,270
well you can put them on as a manager

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,560
but if you have an employee that leaves

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,880
let's say they leave and leave on bad

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,530
terms and they're the owner of the

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,740
account who news what they could do to

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:55,720
your Google account they could even do

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,760
this so I had someone come to me

00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,040
recently and she said I don't know

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,750
business is just off I don't nothing I

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,520
don't know what's happening first thing

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,060
I did was have let me look up on your

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,610
Google and see what's going on Google

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,570
says she's permanently closed not just

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,870
closed for today permanently closed this

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,460
is probably why you're having a decrease

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,370
in your business because of business if

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,790
Google says you're closed you're kind of

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:28,270
closed you're not kind of you are closed

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:30,820
so that's something that it can be fixed

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,680
but again she did not have control of

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,350
her account so she could not admit she

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,900
did not get any notification from Google

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,760
that this had been done she had no way

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,460
to go in and immediately tell Google

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,130
I'm not permanently closed so it had to

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,990
be worked with so you do not want your

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:52,230
business to definitely don't want it to

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,230
say this on Google yes

00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,890
so you're the owner the others are

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,660
managers yeah mm-hmm yeah but the main

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,190
thing is that you'll want and it'll give

00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,140
you have you picked through different

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,850
things and I theory I don't remember

00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,930
exactly there aren't very many choices

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,700
the main thing is that you'll be an

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,810
owner and someone else is going to have

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:19,440
a different role so that brings me to

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:22,410
one thing talking about google guides so

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,490
I I currently am a level seven Google

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,590
guide and what that means is basically

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:31,350
Google guys we sign up and we answer

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,790
questions do tons of reviews Google will

00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,430
come on and ask questions and I'll

00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:37,110
answer them and you got points for all

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,510
of the questions the answer is the

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,180
images the videos that you add on to

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,900
Google about different businesses that

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,500
you visit and Google the higher up you

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,810
get the more authority Google gives you

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,840
so for instance one thing that came up

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,670
recently I went to the acupuncturist for

00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,190
the first time I had a new guy was going

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,670
to and I put in Google and said take me

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:06,090
there and it took me to down the road

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,850
and it said turn left I turn left and I

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,680
couldn't find it so I was looking at the

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,190
street numbers and I had to turn right

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,920
instead of left so when I got there I

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,300
mentioned to him I said Google's got you

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,490
on the other side of the street what's

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,960
going on with that you know people

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,190
aren't gonna find you they're gonna be

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,560
late for your appointments that's going

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,650
to mess your whole day up somebody may

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,650
just go home and not come he said what

00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:35,970
I've been trying for months and months

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:39,630
and months to change my pin Google just

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:42,540
says no so as a level seven guide I was

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,550
able to go in and immediately change it

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,890
and Google accepted it and it's still

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,570
the correct address so that's one reason

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,060
having someone that's a Google guide

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,830
higher up level is important to have

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,440
that you're working with on your team

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,870
because Google looks at that their

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,380
answers as the authority because they

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,910
constantly we constantly give answers to

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,740
Google and tell Google different things

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:09,330
that are going on

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:12,540
I'm sorry um no they don't pay I'm not

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,210
paid occasionally there are different

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,630
little freebie things they'll send out

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:20,130
but however it is it I haven't even

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,960
clicked on some of them some like newbie

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,000
tickets to this or that or the other but

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:30,000
I have a occasionally you'll get

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,680
something so there's really not you

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,750
never know who's a guide and I'm gonna

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,880
get to a lot of questions at the end but

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,380
as far as the google guides that's the

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,630
thing you never know who is a google

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,160
guide so when I go into a store and I'm

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,180
like I'm a level seven guide they better

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,700
be nice to me now but but yeah you never

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,140
know like when somebody is coming in and

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,540
is a Google guide so you need to make

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,250
sure obviously that you're you're doing

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,340
your business well and treating everyone

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:59,450
the same way with respect okay so let's

00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:02,970
get into optimizing your profile again

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:06,720
business google.com you're gonna go in

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:09,540
and basically fill out everything Google

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,050
once you ask for throw all the

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,700
information out

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:18,030
first thing is your name address and

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,860
phone number on this you might just

00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,590
think oh that's easy name address phone

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,660
number no problem you've got to be

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:28,680
consistent there's things called

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:31,980
citations and when I say consistent I

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,470
mean if you are on Main Street make sure

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,320
every place that you enter Main Street

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,970
you enter that and you don't put Main St

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,740
period because if you go in to Google

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,290
and put one thing in Facebook and have

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,110
something else and they're inconsistent

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,670
other places online pick them up other

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,100
places that you haven't even entered the

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,260
information will pick that up and then

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,390
you'll have inconsistent citations and

00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,280
that will hurt you in your ranking so

00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,620
you need to make sure your name address

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,550
phone number is consistent across the

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:09,660
board and the way I like to do that is

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:12,120
figure out exactly how I want it and put

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,070
it in a document and anytime I need to

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,720
input the information that's where I get

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,830
it from I don't have to think back what

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:24,700
did I use it's right there

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:27,970
Oh before I forget I do want to hand

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,310
around my shoebox I am gonna be doing a

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,370
drawing so if anyone is interested in a

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:36,220
free 30-minute video chat with me please

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,540
put your business card in and if you

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,000
don't have a business card you can put

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,560
your name phone number email legibly on

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,990
a piece of paper and I'm going to be

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,670
doing a drawing for that and then also

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,990
everyone will get the slides and I've

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,190
got some other free stuff for you too

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:52,470
okay

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,470
so Google guidelines

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:03,490
you cannot ignore Google I mean we all

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,490
know that but the dot guidelines you

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,930
have to abide by their guidelines I'm

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,470
going to first talk about website and

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,959
phone your website they want your URL

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,670
for your business let's say you've got a

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,160
special going on and you have a landing

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,440
page you cannot use that landing page

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,899
here in your main information for Google

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,940
you've got to use your URL for your

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:30,010
business your main URL website that's

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,660
the cute first one the phone number very

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,300
same thing with the phone number if

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,279
you've got a phone number that you are

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,750
using for let's say something different

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,269
for some type of marketing that you're

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,149
doing you can't use that you've got to

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,180
use your business phone number that you

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:47,829
use every day there you also talked a

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,060
little bit later about website info in

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,269
different places that you can put

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,889
different numbers and websites but for

00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,260
this instance when you're filling out

00:13:53,889 --> 00:14:00,160
your business information it's got to be

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:04,149
your exact information okay let's talk

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,949
about name google says that your

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,139
business name listed on Google my

00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:10,589
business must be your real world name as

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:13,750
used consistently on your storefront

00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:16,269
website stationary and is known to

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:19,959
customers okay so what does all that

00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:24,100
mean let's say you have a business and

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,610
it is Joe's towing you cannot put in

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,959
there

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:31,449
Joe's 24 hour towing marietta that is

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,060
first keyword stuffing which is the 24

00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:36,970
hour and then it's location stuffing

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,130
which is the Marietta you have to put if

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:42,160
your business name is Joe's towing

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,569
that's what it has to be so that's one

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,399
thing you need to make sure that you get

00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:50,500
right on your name your address this is

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,540
a big one especially for businesses that

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,120
are more service related that maybe work

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,010
out of their home the address it's

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,709
really important to know that Google

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:03,550
does not allow a UPS Store box a p.o box

00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:06,850
or one thing that's interesting

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,529
co-working space that I do have a little

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,720
bit of a caveat on so I'll talk about

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,710
that

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,600
wants you to have your address listed if

00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:19,880
you have people come to you to a

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:23,010
storefront location co-working space

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,430
some co-working spaces will have where

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,140
you actually have a desk that you are at

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,600
about seven five seven days a week or

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,310
whatever and they'll also have where you

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,220
have a business phone where you answer

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:39,090
the phone there and you have your name

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,510
listed on a plaque that's acceptable but

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,430
you cannot have your phone answered by

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,870
what are some of these places like Regis

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,640
they'll have like the receptionist that

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,370
always answers your phone that's not

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,620
acceptable it has to be answered there

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,930
so that's the only instance that you can

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,790
use co-working space and this is one

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,610
thing to a lot of home offices so for

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:02,430
instance I work out of my home office I

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,160
don't see customers there I go out and

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:07,320
visit with them so I'm not gonna have my

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,940
home address shown now one point in

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,260
Google when I'm verify my account I'll

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,310
need to give them an address because

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,770
they'll need to make sure that I'm

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,200
actually a person that's real and I have

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:19,080
an address to send stuff to you so I'll

00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,570
give them that address there but it's

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,550
not going to have my home address listed

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,710
on my account because I don't see

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,570
customers there the only time that

00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:32,310
you're going to want to have it listed

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:35,550
is when you are going to see people

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:38,310
actually come to your home and then you

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,560
also have signage for your business

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,420
there at your home not many places have

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,880
that a lot of counties that you have to

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,330
go through a lot of stuff to get around

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,820
that but that's something that you have

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,350
to know for home businesses that you

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,630
can't you have you can give them your

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,140
address but you it has to be hidden yes

00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,140
have a question

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,189
so what you'll do if you have because a

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,350
lot of things are service based so what

00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:08,880
you'll do is Google will ask for your

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,130
service areas and you're going to input

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,689
those service areas and it really

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,970
depends on how you're going to input up

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,669
I like to do a by zip code because it's

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,799
really specific so I'll tell people give

00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:22,079
me all the zip codes and I've entered

00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:23,970
recently I did one that had like 25 or

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,549
so zip codes I don't know that there's a

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,039
limit I haven't reached that yet but you

00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:30,870
can also put cities but for instance if

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,820
you're Atlanta and you do north Atlanta

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,370
but not South Atlanta you're not going

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:39,090
to want to do that so that's one

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,440
instance but now for the pin the only

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,240
ones that will actually have a pin on

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,529
the map are the ones that have addresses

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,919
however you can show in the rankings if

00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:51,360
you don't have actual pin on there so

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,070
that's one of the main things is to make

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,690
sure that you're coming up in the

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:59,730
rankings and the short search rankings

00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:02,820
being found there now Google has

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:06,539
something called the new Google my

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:10,590
business spam complaint form and this is

00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:12,840
to basically report if there's somebody

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,059
out there who has these things they're

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,340
doing the address the names incorrect

00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,010
you can report them I haven't had the

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,269
opportunity to use this because

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,880
typically when I report something to

00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:25,440
Google I haven't had them rejected so I

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,840
haven't had an opportunity to use this

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,450
form but it is available for you there

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,760
and so like I was saying you can't have

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,950
the the name and address has to be

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,789
correct so if you're searching for

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,730
yourself

00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:44,429
you've got to what you'll need to do is

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,279
look up on the search results and see

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:49,049
are you number six and maybe like two or

00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,519
three people above you have all these

00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:55,260
keyword and location stuffing you can

00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,809
those need to be reported they're trying

00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,490
to gain the system and get above you so

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,080
that's one thing that you can do is

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,610
search and look and make sure you're

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,610
working on a level playing field

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm sorry a location something so

00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:13,200
earlier when I said if you were Jose

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:17,160
towing you can't put just towing

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,430
Marietta Jose towing Midtown you've just

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:24,480
got have Jose blowing Plumbing toing

00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:25,500
toing see location stepping is putting

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,960
the globe patience so let's say for

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,700
instance a big one Petsmart they don't

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,250
do this but let's just say Petsmart

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,320
they've got a location in Kennesaw and

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,600
they want to emphasize that so they'll

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,850
put Petsmart - Kennesaw that's not

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,550
allowed they don't do that because I've

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:45,060
checked but but that but that's not

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:48,330
allowed categories when you're inputting

00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,590
your categories this is one thing that

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,230
you can really take a look at your

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:56,430
competition and see exactly what they're

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,380
doing and maybe gain some insight from

00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,720
that so is there something that they're

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,730
putting in as a category that you don't

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,770
have and you're missing out on something

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,110
or is it there something that they don't

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,690
have and you do and you can maybe

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,820
emphasize that and gain some of their

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,560
traffic away from them

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,300
another thing with this I'll say is when

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,780
you're looking at the competitors for

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,750
categories and things like this do not

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:25,500
copy what they're doing for instance if

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:28,760
you have a veterinarian some

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,830
veterinarians do grooming and boarding

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,970
some do not so if you've got a

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:39,390
competitor just down the block and and

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,950
they've got in there boarding and also

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,470
grooming and you're so I'm gonna add

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,240
these into mind don't do it Google will

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,980
find out that you're lying to them and

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,220
you'll come down further in the ring so

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,220
basically it's a tool to use not to copy

00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,770
now your business description this is

00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,360
something that's really important it's

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,650
where you're going to stand out from

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,320
your competition it's where you're going

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:06,200
to tell Google what it is that makes you

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,580
different unique the different services

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,840
products whatever it is that you're

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,520
offering that are different and unique

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,260
you need to make sure that you input

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,250
this information here this is the one

00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,270
place that you can enter that

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:19,100
information tell them what you offer and

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,510
one thing is you need to take some time

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,460
working on this because it's seven

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:26,240
hundred and fifty characters or less

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,670
characters not words characters so make

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,690
sure you're spending some time figuring

00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:34,670
out what you're going to put on that the

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,940
next thing they're different things

00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:39,830
services I said earlier when you enter

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,780
that go and look at it on your cell

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,070
phone because when you go and look at it

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,630
on the computer afterwards you're gonna

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,120
say well I just spent time entering all

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,970
my services and nothing shows up it'll

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,140
show up on the when you're looking on

00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,610
your phone different things attributes

00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,200
these are things basically if you click

00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:01,340
on that or not attributes highlights

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,560
you'll click on that and Google will

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,310
give you a list of things that you can

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,140
choose from you can't pick your own so

00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:11,150
basically I've seen women LED veteran

00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,330
LED if it's like something a restaurant

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,800
it might say Wi-Fi available so

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,870
basically you're going to be able to

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,820
choose what from there

00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,260
google allows you to and when I

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,540
mentioned that I also want to go back

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,910
and talk a second on the categories

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,910
that's also something when you choose

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,950
your category you can't just decide what

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:34,130
what you do you can't say this is the

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,660
category I think I am Google has a list

00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,540
of categories and you have to choose

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,310
from them so that's something you might

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,760
want to spend some time looking down a

00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:46,750
huge long list of categories and see

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,750
where your business fits

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:53,230
okay your holiday and seasonal hours

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,640
these have got to be correct if somebody

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,220
comes by your business and you say

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,440
you're open and whatever you've got

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,880
something seasonal hours and they've

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,260
changed and you're closed

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,970
you're not going to have a happy

00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,820
customer they're gonna get pretty ticked

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,830
off holiday hours as well again I said

00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,630
we've got Memorial Day make sure you've

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,840
got whether you're open or closed on

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,700
that day your specific hours you don't

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,400
want people coming by your store I know

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,920
I went a while ago I was probably a year

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,820
ago to Pyke lift him up on Google they

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,670
said we're open

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,650
I went by they were closed they had

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:30,160
seasonal hours they had not updated

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:32,890
their Google my business okay so because

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,720
of that the goal of my business is not a

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,580
set it and forget it you can't even put

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,690
all your informations that I'm done I'm

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,930
finished

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,890
no it does not work like that you have

00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:48,040
got to consistently keep on top of it

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:51,070
there are also things Q&A so on each

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:55,000
business anyone can go in and ask a

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:57,340
question anyone out there can answer

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,960
that question so let's go back and say

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,300
the holiday hours let's say somebody put

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,190
in there what are your current hours

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,020
this weekend and somebody else goes in

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,940
and answers them and they're wrong

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,000
because you've got just new holiday

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,270
seasonal hours as the business owner you

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,540
need to go in look at that and answer it

00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,430
correctly as the business owner no we've

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,830
got new seasonal hours and this is what

00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:23,710
they are and this is when they last - so

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:27,040
it is not a set it and forget it type of

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:30,610
account and then I want to get to the

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:34,060
reviews again not a set it and forget it

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:38,590
type of platform reviews you've got to

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:43,200
consistently ask for Google reviews few

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:46,360
things not to do you cannot incentivize

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,570
basically that means you can't do any

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,500
contest and say leave us a review and

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,520
you're going to be entered into a

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,610
contest that's a big no-no no giving any

00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:00,270
discounts for leaving reviews

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:02,670
none of that the other thing is no

00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,620
review gating so I'm not sure if you

00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:08,580
were familiar with what review gating is

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:10,320
but that's basically when you send out

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,700
something to all of your customers and

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,510
say how did you like our product or

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:18,240
service and if somebody says loved it

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:20,850
leave us a review hated or didn't like

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,190
it had a problem they'll go over here

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:26,010
and it'll say take them down a whole

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,170
different path that's considered review

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:32,400
gating and Google is strongly against

00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:34,980
that there is here it is there was one

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,809
company I write about online they did

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:41,190
review gating they had 464 reviews

00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:44,250
Google found out they were review gating

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:47,280
and when Google got done with them they

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,690
had 78 reviews left so I'm sure they

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,980
probably paid a company because there

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,500
are companies out there that will read

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:55,410
gate for you probably paid for all those

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,179
reviews had all these reviews and then

00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:59,400
they got them taken down and not only

00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,620
that the business said we had more than

00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,820
78 before we started this review gating

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:09,240
google says we're Google we don't care

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:12,990
so no mu gating the other thing you need

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,480
to do is make sure you consistently ask

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:19,650
for reviews and you want quality reviews

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,440
you don't want just a review a five-star

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,360
review is great as a 5-star review but

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,090
you really want something with more meat

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,610
to it not just great job you want

00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:32,100
something you your real key is to have

00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,540
something with your keywords in it so

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,720
when you're asking them to leave a

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,540
review whatever service our product it

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,549
was that that you provided mention that

00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,890
and try to trigger them to use those

00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:46,140
keywords in your review because when

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,510
Google does searches I've searched

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,880
numerous times and a keyword will come

00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,860
up and they'll say this is why we gave

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,840
you this result and it'll be from an

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,460
answer in a review and they'll have that

00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,280
keyword let's see the and reply to all

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,290
reviews positive reviews of course

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,700
you're going to want to reply to

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,530
negative reviews these are the ones that

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,100
a lot of people cringe on they don't

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,610
want to

00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:15,120
with you have to the main thing I will

00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:17,100
say about the negative reviews don't go

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,440
overboard don't let them take you down

00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,280
the rabbit hole and leave a huge long

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,830
review response to their negative review

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,120
basically be short concise and pleasant

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,160
businesslike with them and just

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,080
basically ask you to say I'm sorry you

00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,570
had this experience I would love to talk

00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,540
to you further to see what we can do

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,200
about this because when you light your

00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,080
response

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,240
you're not only writing it for that

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,460
person you're writing it for everyone

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,730
out there I'll tell you one of the first

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:51,510
things I do when I look at reviews I

00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:54,360
sort it by the lowest score people do

00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:56,490
that I'm not the only one and look and

00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,060
see what the negative reviews are and

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,770
see how the business owner responded so

00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,330
if you're like oh it's one crazy person

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,130
they just evidently don't like anybody

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,290
and they just left a review bad review

00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,550
because they had a bad day well a lot of

00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,770
times people can kind of read through

00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,630
and tell this is might be unusual and

00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,770
and if they see you just go down a

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,940
rabbit hole with them they said well

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,990
this business owner they might be a

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,790
little bit crazy too

00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,230
I don't want to do business with them so

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,450
that's why you want to be it and

00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,150
basically be polite and just short and

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:29,160
try to get it offline and and deal with

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:33,120
it that way few more things for

00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,820
different statistics 68% of customers

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,920
have left a local business review that's

00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,870
one of the things a lot of people

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,580
they've had a good experience they'll

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,840
want to leave your review just say can

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,150
you help me out leave me a review I'm

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,550
trying to get up help me out on Google

00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,520
I'd really love you to leave a review

00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:54,300
people are really willing to do that

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:57,570
let's see 91 percent of 18 to 34 year

00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:01,470
olds trust online reviews as much as

00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:04,050
personal recommendations that's a pretty

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,150
big number I know a lot of times if

00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:08,550
someone if I get a recommendation I

00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:11,880
might then go online and look them up to

00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,590
see what it says online so that's

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,680
something you definitely need to keep

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:19,020
into in mind also like I said earlier

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,100
82% of customers seek out negative

00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,750
reviews they want to see

00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:29,200
what the negative review was and how the

00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:32,590
business owner responded to it post this

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,920
is something that Google right now has

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:39,150
is your free advertising you can post as

00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:42,790
often as you want I recommend at least

00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,650
once a week at a very minimum once a

00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,230
week because these posts stay live for

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:50,710
seven days so you need to post at least

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:53,470
once a week you're going to post images

00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:56,170
you can also post some short videos this

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:59,590
is your free advertising you can post

00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:01,990
your specials your promotions your

00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:04,000
events make sure you're posting events

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,730
that you've got on there post them on

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,520
your Google my business profile any type

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:15,760
of promotions also when you're posting

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:18,130
it it will say add a link optional no no

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,050
no that's not optional that's just

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,240
google telling you it's optional it's

00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,860
not optional for you that's where you

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,630
can put a link there that's different

00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,330
than your URL so let's say for instance

00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:31,090
you've got something going on and you've

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:33,580
got a sales landing page you can use

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,460
that and put that information there so

00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:39,490
make sure you're using the posts in

00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,580
Google my business the other thing

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,650
you'll want to do is embed your Google

00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,930
my business map on your website because

00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,390
has a nice pretty little map there and

00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,670
you can see the stars people can look on

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,850
there and see so you definitely want to

00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:57,910
embed that on your website now I've also

00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:01,300
seen people put a button on their site

00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,950
that says leave us a review I typically

00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,410
don't like doing that because that's

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,330
kind of like for everybody and I don't

00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,280
know that you're my customer I want to

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,530
send my direct people that I've had

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:15,850
direct contact with directly to leave a

00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:19,470
review so I typically don't do that one

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:23,680
thing is if you do that please make sure

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:26,920
you are leaving a link to your Google my

00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,350
business profile so I had a client come

00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,780
to me recently and she said she's

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,400
starting a business and here's a website

00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,980
for a competitor and this is what she's

00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,200
going to be doing

00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,240
so go Kay let me take a look and see see

00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,299
everything that's going on for this

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,580
business there was a link a button on

00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,900
the site that said leave us a review so

00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,890
I'm going to check out for Google my

00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,840
business page so I clicked on it my

00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:54,320
client and her competitor are in

00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,900
California the place that it took for

00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,679
the customers to leave reviews all the

00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:03,980
way in North Carolina it was a very

00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:06,770
similar name somebody had simply set up

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,990
the website and searched on Google found

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:11,480
a similar name and stuck it in there and

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,040
said give us reviews and that place had

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,740
over a hundred and some reviews I'm like

00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,570
how many reviews did this business in

00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,850
North Carolina get that are actually for

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,860
this business in California so make sure

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,660
you're checking things like that and

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,059
again when you're asking for reviews

00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:29,179
definitely give them the direct link to

00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:37,490
your Google my business to leave a

00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:40,460
review ok so again it is not a set it

00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:43,250
and forget it people can go in ask and

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,950
answer questions and again anybody can

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,679
report something as incorrect you need

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,470
to make sure you're going in

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,480
consistently and checking those make

00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,370
sure sometimes Google will say you have

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,770
a pending edit you need to take a look

00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,720
at that decide is this something that

00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,540
that needs correcting or is this

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,880
something that is incorrect and I need

00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,549
to let Google know no this is not right

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,740
so it is not a set it and forget it

00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:14,380
you've got to spend time on it ok so

00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:19,970
what is next with Google my business

00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:21,620
it's Google who knows recently they this

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,600
week actually they came out with a

00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,250
survey and I know a lot of people are

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,530
freaking out saying because the survey

00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,850
was talking about Google monetizing

00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,220
Google my business

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,110
possibly charging for the account all I

00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,820
can say that that is right now they sent

00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,640
a survey out we have no idea what's

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,690
going on with it no idea if it's going

00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,850
to be something that's paid in the

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,090
future or not and if it's paid how much

00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:45,320
it would be so the main thing is and and

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,260
the other thing they just sent a survey

00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,150
out they could change it next week

00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,610
they could change it next year who knows

00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,950
so basically get in claim your account

00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:56,880
optimize it make sure you're using your

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,880
