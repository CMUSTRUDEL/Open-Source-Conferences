00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:12,929

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:22,970
you look at this image what are the

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:22,970

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,780
a thousand words

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,570
why should this saying matter to

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,660
businesses do you use photos on your

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,460

local restaurants which one are we going

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,990
this one or this restaurant your photos

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,090
can turn people away which is loss of

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,180
customers loss of referrals trust

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,939
credibility loss of revenue or your

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,700
photos can inspire people to do business

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:40,860
with you say you need to have surgery

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,939
using these actual photos from LinkedIn

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,509
and Hospital websites

00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:51,189
let's choose that surgeon which one are

00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:54,490
we gonna go with the recent graduate the

00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:59,950
fisherman or the lady having drinks at

00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:02,289
TGI Fridays all too often we choose

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,090
photos that are ain't good enough

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,280
we need a photos so we take a quick

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,640
snapshot or grab any old photo that's

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,090
available not realizing the message that

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,549
it's sending but people just start

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,470
searching for hotels and restaurants and

00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:21,879
doctors they're searching for our

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,650
businesses to an 80% of people will

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,160
research you and your company online

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,840
before making a decision and on the

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,360
Internet people don't have to make

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,720
excuses to walk away and choose someone

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,970
else so while it said you shouldn't

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,790
judge a book by its cover the reality is

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:43,359
we all do it it's just how our brains

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:48,040
function imagine searching for a recipe

00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:49,920
without the photos what are we cooking

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,950
for dinner tonight

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,609
it's the photos that inspire us to

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:02,739
connect to learn more imagine Amazon

00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:08,079
without any photos what are we going to

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:10,120
buy it's the photos that connect us the

00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:14,019
make us want to click to learn more to

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,060
read more about what is being offered we

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,120
all thread over which words are just the

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,459
perfect words and even which font I just

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,569
spent two days picking out a single font

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:28,840
for my business card but we can't spend

00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:34,120
all our time on one that we completely

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:38,650
ignore the other your photos are a vital

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,129
part of your marketing 90% of

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,919
information transmitted to our brains is

00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:50,340
visual visual information gets to the

00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,340
brain 60,000 times faster than text

00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:01,480
in the deepest part of our brain the

00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:05,340
survival part it is hardwired to form an

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:10,480
impression to the instant we see someone

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:15,129
your subconscious brain makes a

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:19,389
conclusion about a person unless someone

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:21,400
half of one tenth of a second so how can

00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,740
we win someone over in less than a

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,190
second what's going to make someone

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,660
searching online stop and then all the

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,139
people that are available and say that

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:37,360
they want to do business with you

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:39,039
the simple answer a connection people

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,900
want to do business with people that

00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,380
they like know and trust

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:48,099
not faceless websites especially when it

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,780
comes to a service based business so

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,570
let's start with your business portrait

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,500
it's commonly referred to as a headshot

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:59,020
or a profile photo it is the most

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:03,340
important photo on your website and

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:06,070
social media because it's the photo the

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,449
photo that represents you it's the first

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,729
thing that people see when they browse

00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:13,330
your profile and it's the mental image

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:15,400
they are going to recall remember we are

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,310
hardwired to form an impression to the

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,199
instant we see someone so let's look at

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,009
some common missed opportunities that

00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:27,820
people do with those profile photos from

00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:32,380
a psychology standpoint arms crossed say

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:37,229
I'm closed off leaning away says doesn't

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:40,030
care too far away hits it insecurities

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,570
it's hard to establish trust with this

00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,570
person

00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:49,819
we don't like it when somebody's in our

00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:51,979
personal space even in a photograph too

00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:55,179
high asserts dominance while too low

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:57,799
shows weakness and lacks confidence

00:05:55,179 --> 00:06:01,939
selfies often have too many distractions

00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:03,709
especially the bathroom ones think about

00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:07,579
all the information that is in front of

00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:10,039
our eyes color shapes lights movement

00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:13,519
words texture all vying for our

00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:16,279
attention remember you have less than a

00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,379
second and anything that distracts the

00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,349
viewer takes away from you establishing

00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:24,349
that connection the opposite of the

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:28,089
selfie the everybody photo which one are

00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:31,099
you there's no personal connection and

00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:34,369
my personal favorite the disembodied

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,989
friend there's no connection because

00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:39,860
we're all wondering who that person was

00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:42,129
and covering your eyes there's no

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,989
connection what are we hiding and

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:50,299
looking away we tend to follow the gaze

00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:54,110
of others and wide eyes this makes us

00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:56,119
uncertain and eager while tired eyes

00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:00,949
there's no confidence it's hard to trust

00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:02,749
this person and clothing says so much

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:04,299
this is I would rather be anywhere else

00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:07,369
than working today

00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:12,169
these people would rather be anywhere

00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:18,049
else than doing business with you actual

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:20,149
LinkedIn photos poor lighting it creates

00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:24,259
wrinkles and it ages us and makes us

00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:27,049
less trustworthy nobody wants that and a

00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:30,439
fake smile most people can spot it it

00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:32,059
doesn't generate trust but you have that

00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,639
opportunity to make that connection in

00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:37,189
less than a second how do you do that

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,489
you do it with your headshot with that

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:42,319
profile photo you narrow it down to just

00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:44,689
your head and shoulders because you

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,399
reduce unnecessary distractions giving

00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,449
you a better chance of making that

00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,449
instant connection

00:07:54,409 --> 00:08:00,119
remember it's about you just you

00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,009
connecting with your target audience so

00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:05,659
look directly into the camera because

00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:05,659
that communicates credibility

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,370
and a warm expression says I'm open to

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,370
connection

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,750
and a genuine smile makes us more

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,670
approachable and has been said to

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,670
generate trust instantly

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,560
and good lighting makes us more

00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,170
trustworthy more approachable more

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,110
radiant and a good photographer can take

00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:48,570
it a step further because while this is

00:08:44,110 --> 00:09:00,940
reality that is marketing reality

00:08:48,570 --> 00:09:03,280
marketing reality marketing we live in a

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,450
highly competitive world and what you

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,820
mark it with matters all of your photos

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,950
from your headshot to all the photos on

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,140
your website and your social media they

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,190
are a significant part of your marketing

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,130
strategy marketing is about standing out

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,730
from your competition connecting with

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,800
and engaging that target audience

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,380
building a brand reputation and boosting

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,320
your word-of-mouth and communicating

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:36,760
that you are worth every single dollar

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:40,570
that you are charging the right photos

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,760
can give you a competitive edge but you

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,650
have to make the effort to stand out

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,140
from the competition and connect with

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:50,470
the target audience think about this

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:54,190
you make the extra effort when you go on

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:58,500
a job interview you make the extra

00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:01,210
effort when you go on a first date why

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,650
because we care about the impression

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,370
that we're giving to the person sitting

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:09,580
across from us your headshot is that

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:14,710
first impression an online it represents

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:17,650
you 24/7 365 so you have to choose it

00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:21,280
carefully how do you choose just the

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,980
right headshot here's a brainstorming

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,750
exercise that I do with my clients for

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,880
the sake of time I'll put this back up

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,230
at the end so everybody will be able to

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,670
take a screen capture but for the sake

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,060
of time we're going to narrow this down

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:36,640
to just two I want you to think about

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,370
your words write them down put them in

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,810
your phone when somebody describes you

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,540
when you describe yourself in your

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,290
business write down three positive words

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,080
I am

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,510
fill in the blanks my business is fill

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,700
in the blanks this is a vital to your

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:56,150
marketing this is what you are wanting

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,340
to convey to the world the ones that I

00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,070
most often hear from my clients are I

00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:04,040
want to look professional friendly and

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,380
approachable those are great words but

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,440
your words are going to vary based on

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,940
your profession your unique personality

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,740
and what it is that sets you apart

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,870
for example defense attorney might want

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,570
their words to be confident no-nonsense

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,490
on top of their game whereas a

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,810
veterinarian might want theirs to be

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,350
friendly respectable and knowledgeable

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,430
think about it

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:34,310
what are your words write them down then

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,680
show that headshot to five to ten people

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,380
preferably your clients your target

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,290
audience even total strangers people

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,840
that don't have a vested interest in you

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,310
don't show it to your family and friends

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,740
one they're not your target audience and

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,260
two they're biased by your their love

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,660
for you rightfully so they're gonna tell

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,200
you what you want to hear and three they

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,720
are not your target audience write down

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,950
all of their words make a list of what

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,300
they see when they look at your photo

00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,250
then it's time to tally up the words

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,570
pull back out your words and look at the

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:14,200
list what words did you use and what

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,120
words did they use is there a disconnect

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:21,140
are you showing the world what you think

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,020
you're showing the world you might like

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:28,040
your photo and it might be well lit but

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:30,860
is it sending the right message is it

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,430
connecting with and engaging your target

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:37,850
audience even the slightest variation

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:42,850
and facial expressions can turn people

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:45,470
away or inspire them to connect with you

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:49,400
by a show of hands which one do you

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:52,310
prefer let's choose a headshot a

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,820
come on raising high or be there's no

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,960
wrong answer here what if I told you she

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,720
is a real estate agent

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:04,220
A or B

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:11,480
what if I told you she was a book editor

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:17,779
A or B how about an attorney

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:19,610
A or B how many of you changed your

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,210
opinion based on her profession in her

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,640
target audience with every photo that

00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,980
you use on your website and social media

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,960
you have to think about your target

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,200
audience what's going to connect with

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,200
them what's going to engage them once

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,300
you've chosen that right photo it's time

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,250
to update it in all the places that your

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,490
headshot is it isn't more places than

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,930
you even realize customers come to us

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,339
from different channels so you want to

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,110
make sure that you are connecting with

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:52,400
them and engaging them no matter how

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,510
they're finding you and for those that

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,550
came in late we had a little bit of

00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,520
technical difficulty so the aspect ratio

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:01,490
has been changed here so I'll provide

00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,660
this information later let's talk about

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:07,100
your about page you need to have a

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,290
really good engaging photo on your about

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,390
page when somebody lands there why do

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,860
they go to your about page exactly

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:19,279
capture them don't make them bounce with

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,170
that photo update it on social media

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,730
again people come to us from all

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,380
different channels and you want to make

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,600
sure that you are connecting with them

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,520
also make sure that it looks good

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,839
especially on LinkedIn that little tiny

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:35,150
oval that they give you specialty

00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,480
websites where do you have your services

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:42,529
listed you want to make sure that you

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,630
are winning that job that you are spar

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:49,100
surpassing the competition that is also

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:50,959
on there extremely important I cannot

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,330
stress this enough if you only take away

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,920
one thing from this you have to have an

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,170
engaging

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,569
really really good headshot on your job

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,389
proposals because this is how you put

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:04,309
yourself in the room connecting with the

00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:10,429
person that is making a decision about

00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:13,339
who to award that job to and on your

00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:18,069
reviews by placing a headshot on your

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:20,089
reviews like the LinkedIn like the

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:22,399
Amazon thing that I showed you earlier

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,619
you're increasing the possibility that

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,509
somebody is actually going to read those

00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:28,429
reviews you're increasing your

00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,169
credibility by placing a photo with it

00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,850
and the all-important they be heard

00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:36,379
about today those conversion rates

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:38,089
you're increasing that as well your

00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,790
product or service is just one of many

00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:42,999
the consumer has to choose from many of

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:47,359
you in this room offer similar services

00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:49,600
these are essentially all sodas and yet

00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:52,790
they all market themselves differently

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,669
one you're sharing with a friend another

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:59,360
you're jumping off a mountains

00:15:54,669 --> 00:16:01,850
how are you marketing yourself are your

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,019
photos connecting with and engaging your

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,910
target audience it is important that you

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:12,559
use images that are relevant and

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:16,100
cohesive to your business these are both

00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,779
clothing companies clothing company a is

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,470
doing a really good job of using

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:25,189
relevant and cohesive images clothing

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:28,220
company B it's confusing

00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:31,610
you should never confuse your target

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,489
audience it's important that you use

00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,309
images that show what you offer and the

00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:41,239
problems that you solve these are both

00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:44,929
architects if you were in need of an

00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:46,850
architect architect a is showing you

00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:49,239
some pretty inspiring photos about what

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:53,299
they might be able to do for you

00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:58,069
architect B does not show us even one

00:16:53,299 --> 00:17:00,589
photo of what he has to offer you it's

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:03,210
important that you use images to inspire

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,250
that connection and that engagement

00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:08,100
this is a heat map it's a tool used to

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,010
show user behavior the red is where the

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,220
viewers eyes linger the most what can we

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:16,680
learn from this we tend to follow the

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,150
gaze of others so when you have a

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,450
headshot and you want somebody to

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:24,390
connect with you where do you look

00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:27,600
directly into that camera you're

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:30,300
inspiring the connection with you when

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,610
you have a product or something really

00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,820
important you turn your body in your

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:39,210
head towards that product like the

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,620
all-important call-to-action button you

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,910
want to turn and face that

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,560
call-to-action button because you're

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,820
going to increase you're going to

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:51,570
increase your conversions your contact

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,180
information is important never ever ever

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:57,300
turn your back on your contact

00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,950
information you are lowering the

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:03,450
likelihood that somebody will actually

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:05,460
reach out to you your photos should do

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:09,180
their job which is to connect with and

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,060
engage the viewer so how can you get

00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,920
those photos you can hire a professional

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,670
you can purchase stock photos or you can

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,620
do it yourself

00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:20,100
so let's talk a little bit about each of

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,710
these so stock photos there are do's and

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,200
don'ts of stock photography first don't

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:29,160
choose cheesy images they just don't

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,740
connect with most people don't select

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:35,100
images for yourself this is not what we

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,230
do in an office that looks more like

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,970
what we would actually do in an office

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:43,710
so choose images that actually look real

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:46,310
don't choose random images this is on

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,630
over 200 different company websites

00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:51,150
while it might work for the travel

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,110
company it's kind of confusing for the

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,110
oil change company

00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,140
do your homework

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,390
right-click on that image and find out

00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,760
where else it is on the internet before

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:08,810
you purchase it this photo the girl in

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:11,720
the car is over 300 different company

00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,370
websites 100 car rental company is a

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,710
hundred and twenty five car insurance

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,410
companies the whole point of having a

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:22,550
website is to say I'm different from my

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,840
competition do business with me what are

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,630
you doing if you're using the same

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,300
images as everybody else when you

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,800
right-click on her photo on the stock

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,150
site it'll show you all of the other

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,630
images in case you like that particular

00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:39,200
model over ten thousand different

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:43,880
companies are using her as their

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,560
spokesperson and I'd be dropping the

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,600
ball at this point if I didn't explain

00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,000
to you that when you swap out those

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,860
stock photos with actual images of you

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,710
and your business your conversion rates

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:58,160
increase there's study after study after

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,530
study that shows this the top one is a

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,500
moving company these are the people

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,660
coming into your home loading up your

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,960
worldly possessions and leaving your

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,190
house with them when they swapped out

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,680
the stock photo with the real-life

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,200
movers doing that their conversions went

00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,940
up by over forty five percent your

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,890
clients are giving you their password

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,660
their life their business their

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,570
likelihood they want to do business with

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,490
somebody that they like know and trust

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,500
the bottom photo was actually confusing

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,500
while this laptop is a pretty good stock

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,820
photo when you look at a laptop and

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,380
you're signing up for a conference would

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,340
you think this was an online conference

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:39,200
it was an in-person conference when they

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,000
swapped the photo out with the previous

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,530
year's conference photos their synapse

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,410
went up by over 40% just don't choose

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,300
cheesy stock images and if you still

00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,570
want to at least use the ones with Vince

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,570
Vaughn

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,890

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,159
their pocket don't go out and buy

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,400
expensive equipment when you're posting

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,580
images on social media these things take

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,850
really really good pictures but you have

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,950
to learn how to do photography at least

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,720
the basics good lighting and good

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,750
composition when I was learning

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,520
photography twenty-something years ago

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,679
they didn't have YouTube they didn't

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:33,090
have all those resources available you

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:35,820
can learn photography for free just at

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,559
least learn the basics and then learn to

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,909
look at the details in those photos

00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,250
what's distracting

00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:43,110
what can you eliminate what's gonna add

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,900
to the story what can you put in that

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,640
photo look at the background are there

00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,020
palm trees sticking out at the top of

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,340
people's heads is that taking away and

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,720
then everybody's you know we get in a

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,120
rush and at the last moment we're

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,669
posting a blog post and that's why we

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,030
end up using those really bad images you

00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:06,690
can stockpile your own photos as you go

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:08,190
about your day today and you see

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,280
something go ahead and pull out your

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,419
cell phone and take a moment walk around

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,429
different angle is there a different

00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:16,710
approach something you can add and take

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:19,289
that photo and then hit the favorites

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,490
button later month from now when you're

00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,510
going through and trying to find that

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,090
photo you don't want to scroll through

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:27,780
thousands of images you already have it

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:29,850
save yourself time and effort and then

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,179
as with anything just practice practice

00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:35,610
practice and have fun photography is fun

00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:37,830
and then if you choose to hire a

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:40,460
professional photographer which I highly

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,169
recommend for at least your headshots

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,179
it's really simple make a list of the

00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,880
photos that you need you need a headshot

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,770
it's everywhere you need something

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,450
that's going to connect engage and show

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,490
that you're worth what you're charging

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,010
how many pages do you have on your

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,730
website for okay now you're up to five

00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,039
photos

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:01,840
there's no excuse you can knock that out

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,630
in a couple of hours

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,600
research ask around who else photos do

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,980
you like find out who they hired

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,960
research the photographer actually get

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,450
on their website look at those facial

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,530
expressions do they connect with you if

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,090
a photographer ever asks you to smile

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,580
gather your stuff and leave pretend you

00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:25,669
have an emergency it's not your job it's

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,350
their job to engage you to make you

00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:28,520
comfortable in front of the camera and

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,289
comfortable with a photo that they're

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,360
giving you has something that's actually

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:34,010
gonna have a genuine expression that's

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,280
gonna do its job to connect with your

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,820
target audience and then get it on the

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,650
calendar

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,230
if you're like me it doesn't exist

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,090
unless it's on the calendar and

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,799
everybody asks how long I've got my

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,600
headshot how long should this last me a

00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,970
good headshot should last you three to

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:55,159
five years so if you can't invest one

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:56,960
hour of your time for your business save

00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,600
time when you get your photos from your

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,990
photographer ask them for the sizes that

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,130
you're going to need don't waste time

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,289
Facebook Instagram linkit they all

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,970
require different sizes don't waste your

00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:09,710
time on it have them for fight that's

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:13,520
why you're hiring a professional to take

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:17,510
care of you no matter where you get your

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,820
images from you really need to seriously

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,250
look at those photos and say is this

00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,950
photo going to help me or hurt me before

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,919
you put it on your website before you

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,620
put it on social media imagine you're at

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,190
a networking meeting and somebody pulls

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,690
you to the side and says we need to talk

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,500
I've been referring my clients to your

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,850
business I heard back from a couple of

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,299
them that they checked out your website

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,770
and you just didn't look professional

00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:47,870
that happened to one of my clients it is

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,669
the sole reason they reached out to me

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,210
and hired me to update their headshots

00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:55,130
on their website after the photo shoot

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,630
they said you know would you mind

00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,240
looking at our website and see if

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,840
there's any other photos that we might

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,710
need to change out I looked at their

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,390
desktop and I looked at their mobile

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,700
version and I found this on their mobile

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,750
version I actually grayed out the name

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,100
of the company because it's not

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,429
important it can happen to any

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,660
thus this basically says you don't own

00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,950
this image we're going to keep it

00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:22,480
watermark until you pay for it that was

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,549
on their website for five years

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,850
think about that nobody is going to tell

00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:31,010
you that your images are bad or hurting

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,780
you that was a rare unicorn that

00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,179
actually came up to them and told them

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:40,610
five years it took one person to tell

00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:44,990
somebody you have to look at your images

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:48,440
honestly and say should I even be using

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:51,080
this for my company you're the

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,059
gatekeeper it's ultimately up to you

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,600
what you post for your company and what

00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:57,799
you throw away so there's a quick

00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,299
checklist we can go through of

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,010
everything we talked about today you can

00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,380
do this in a matter of 30 seconds when

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,240
you have a picture quickly do it a

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:10,789
once-over and decide are you even going

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:12,770
to use that image any image from now on

00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:14,510
go through the checklist but for the

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:17,809
sake of today so everybody's on the same

00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,130
page think about your hero image what is

00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,960
that big image on the front of your

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,400
website that greets visitors come on

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,730
seriously everybody think about your

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,679
image everybody have that in mind what

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,200
you're currently using okay let's go

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,799
through the checklist what is the

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,650
purpose of that photo is it to entertain

00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:38,210
educate inform inspire and vote engage

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,080
is it doing that

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,080
be honest

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:51,830
with that photo in mind what does it

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:53,600
actually say is it confusing is there a

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,660
person in it what is their body language

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,010
like what is their facial expression is

00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:04,820
their body towards what you want the

00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:06,650
viewer to engage with are there any

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,970
distractions are the things that should

00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:15,470
have been eliminated and not in that

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:22,040
photo at all is that photo on message

00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:26,420
cohesive with your brand is it going to

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,460
connect with your target audience this

00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:32,690
might work well for spa but not so much

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,740
for an energy drink company that photo

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,960
that you have in mind

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:42,350
is it grabbing people's attention or is

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:44,480
it making them bounce have you looked at

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,160
both the desktop and the mobile version

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,800
to make sure that something hasn't gone

00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,540
wonky words over people's faces squished

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,730
like today's presentation which I have

00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,610
no control over but have you looked at

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,020
both of them and then something we

00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,240
haven't thought about or talked about

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,660
have you thought about the all-important

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,430
SEO that search engine optimization

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:07,640
naming and tagging your photos properly

00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:10,130
nobody searches for IMG underscore what

00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,680
ever dot jpg they search for your

00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:15,290
specific type of business or service

00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,960
what are those keywords that people use

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:21,140
to find you on the internet you need to

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,140
name your photos that before you ever

00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,240
upload them to the Internet what are

00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,520
your keywords get them into the file

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,320
name so then by the time you do get it

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,690
up to your WordPress site you're

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,630
entering those same keywords into that

00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,790
all-important alt text that alt text

00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:42,020
improves your SEO and the accessibility

00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:44,630
of your website more people than you

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,600
realize use Google images when searching

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,630
for a specific type of business service

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,950
or product

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,780
naming and tagging your photos can

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,559
actually help your business show up in

00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:59,510
those all-important search results so

00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,059
that by the time somebody does land on

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,480
your website like restaurant a you're

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:06,890
actually inspiring that connection

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,659
instead of like restaurant B where you

00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:13,159
want to bounce and go back to restaurant

00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:15,650
a you're not hitting them with a wallet

00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,590
X like the recipe website that I showed

00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,850
you are Amazon without any photos while

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,559
words are important

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,980
it's the photos that are going to

00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,570
connect inspire that engagement what

00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,659
were those words that you thought about

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:38,270
earlier are your photos expressing that

00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:40,850
and conveying those words a picture is

00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,669
worth a thousand words but make sure

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:46,730
yours are also worth more customers more

00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:49,850
referrals and more revenue what you show

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,770
the world is ultimately up to you so you

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,590
have to choose your photos with care

00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:57,260
because they market you everywhere and

00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:00,740
as you go about your day today always

00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,220
remember a picture is worth a thousand

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,500
words

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:12,169
what do you want your business photos to

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:16,250
say thank you this is the checklist

00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:17,809
bigger I'm gonna grab a drink and then

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,350
we'll start with questions if anybody

00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:20,350
has any

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:32,340
and then this is the oh go back okay got

00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:32,340
it thank you all for coming

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,750
some of them yes and the websites a

00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:40,120
whole nother issue I'm not a wordpress

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,480
person so I have managed to erase my

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:46,120
website twice this week thank God for

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,129
backups but it's a year old backup Jason

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:52,570
is going to be working on getting my I

00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:54,250
actually built the website this is a

00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,789
third time I built it and I erased it

00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,289
twice so a little stressful but the

00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:01,809
images on there so really good and on

00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:05,080
the blog I do have some of these slides

00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:07,840
that I went ahead and quickly most of

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,190
them got erased but I tried this morning

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,110
in the parking lot to at least get some

00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,850
of them back up there for you and this

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,159
is the longer ones that I do with my

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:18,460
company when we're going over

00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,559
brainstorming sessions with clients we

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,669
do this along with a story brand I know

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,070

00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:26,889

00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:46,120
tube down the middle

00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:48,610

brand by Donald Miller and then

00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:04,929
everything else you've learned over the

00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:06,309
course this weekend that SEO and all the

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:09,190

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,480
to learn to grow you've got this you can

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,470
connect and engage that target audience

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,470
yes

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:29,580
it should be updated next week he's

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:37,710
really busy so I'm gonna have to like

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:40,080
try to slide in there yes here's the

00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,760
list of and this is actually on I did

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,540
make sure that at lunchtime I got this

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:49,730
blog post up Mary and Davidson /blog

00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:53,610
it's like one of the recent three yep

00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:56,280
who here loves doing photography taking

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,320
pictures something that I actually

00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,290
thought about while standing here

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,020
waiting for all of this next year which

00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,190
I'll be willing to wake up early

00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,040
unscheduled not on the thing and maybe

00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,809
do a photo walk to learn a little bit of

00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,470
photography you've come all the way into

00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:14,820
town

00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:16,020
show hands okay let's see if we can make

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,700
that happen there's a couple of

00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,280
organizers in the room so now that we

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,290
know let's make that happen let's let's

00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:31,130
learn to take better photos and be able

00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:31,130
to use them alright questions yes

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,900
and one that I've added to this recently

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:39,010
is my superpowers because everybody

00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,650
likes that like I don't know if you

00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:43,540
noticed but on the Amazon slide I had to

00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:49,480
slip in the may the fourth be with you

00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:51,700
on the Amazon what's your biggest

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,590
struggle with making sure that you have

00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:58,920
photos is it time is it just the energy

00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,920
to do it

00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:08,100
nobody's photogenic but you have to get

00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,350
somebody that's going to to help you

00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,660
because nobody is naturally photogenic

00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:16,290
you want to know why can we get out for

00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:18,610
a moment here's why we're not photogenic

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,280
think of us have you ever heard your

00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:23,020
voice do you like your voice it's the

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,460
acoustics of your brain it makes you

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,550
sound differently what you actually hear

00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,950
is how you sound okay when you look in

00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,450
the mirror you're actually seeing a

00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,450
reflection of yourself right if you have

00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,680
a t-shirt on all the words are backwards

00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:38,620
that's what you're used to seeing since

00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,390
birth and the crib you see a reflection

00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,130
over a hundred times a day so your brain

00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:45,340
is used to everything being completely

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:47,470
the opposite of what it actually is in a

00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,700
photograph that's why we can't connect

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:51,700
with those images and think we're not

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,740
put in it so if you take an image and

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,790
you know you've been there your friends

00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,110
are like I don't like this image of

00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,000
myself and you're like no it's a really

00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,560
great image it's because they're seeing

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,020
a reflection it's that that voice

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,700
problem so if you take that image and

00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,480
actually mirror it there's app so you

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,610
can do that

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,130
you will actually connect with your

00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,810
images and then if you can get somebody

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,490
to engage with you and actually get a

00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:15,790
genuine expression and not just say

00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:18,880
smile you you will I promise you would

00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,260
like the photos of yourself yeah and

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,840
body language in all of those little

00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:27,690
things yeah

00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,700
you need one headshot think about it

00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,560
if somebody's finding you in a cafe and

00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,510
you're wearing a bright yellow shirt

00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,730
with black stripes and then they're

00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:37,920
finding you you know your business card

00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,450
somewhere else and your look completely

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,940
different they want that familiarity

00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,500
when somebody a networking event event

00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,540
says you should do business with this

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,170
web designer oh I've seen them somewhere

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:51,450
before they must be good you want that

00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,910
same headshot everywhere there are

00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,800
variations like we did Jason's his was

00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,840
the blue shirt which I actually

00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,150
photoshopped he wore an orange short

00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,060
shirt which looks really good on his

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,680
Facebook so we did keep it only one

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,710
person has realized it's the exact same

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,290
Edmunds with a different color shirt but

00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:14,040
you really want that same image so take

00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:17,280
the time to get one really good image

00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:22,830
it's really important yes sir you had

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,750
your hand up no don't purge you know why

00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:28,890
you don't purge it makes it overwhelming

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,240
right we eat our dinner one forkful at a

00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,220
time you don't want to dump your entire

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,690
plate in your belly at one time it's it

00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,920
really is overwhelming and I do not

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,960
recommend that to anybody

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,060
start with your hero image start with

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,390
your headshot at least do those two and

00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,040
then as you go back and repost those

00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,560
photos and change them out just go

00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,110
through that checklist you know I

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,150
personally have a private Facebook group

00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,150
as myself and nine other so there's 10

00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:56,370
of us I've had it for years the keynote

00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,900
speaker this morning said somebody find

00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,690
somebody that will tell you you're

00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,580
stupid that really resonated with me

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,770
because before we post anything on

00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,780
social media our websites I actually use

00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,760
it for my clients like the two headshots

00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,110
that I had up with her permission I

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,480
actually put him into that group and

00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,610
said cuz those are two she chose she's

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,440
actually a veterinarian and an attorney

00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:20,240
talked about an amazing woman she's a

00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,460
doctor in an attorney so find those

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,440
couple of people that say you should

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,150
update this image and then you should

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,490
update this image just start with one

00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:31,020
how are people finding in your headshot

00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,720
is everywhere your hero images on your

00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,970
website and then just start little

00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,150
pieces at a time

00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:47,720
and then start from now by posting

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:49,339
better images going forward you have

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,160
less than a second that's how our brains

00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:54,619
work so for the hero image and things

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,450
like that you want that personality you

00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:01,970
want that engagement we actually did it

00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:03,650
with for those you you really want a

00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,510
little bit of personality you want

00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,069
people to linger you notice he's

00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,990
actually leaning his name of his

00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:11,839
company's leaning is the same as logo

00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:14,030
he's a Disney person we made sure his

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,770
personality is in there but when you

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,420
have that headshot and it's on LinkedIn

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:19,760
and it's on Facebook and it's on and

00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,319
it's this little tiny oval the planar

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,050
the background the better it doesn't

00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:24,770
have to be white who's your target

00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,750
audience

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:29,180
what is your branding what is your

00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:32,390
colors what are really think about those

00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:35,900
and then that's your that's your plain

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:39,640
background but yes you want to grab that

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,640
attention and keep it on you

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,140
how important do you feel it is to have

00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,700
that headshot on your personal Facebook

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:58,190
your personal Instagram

00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:59,930
not printing so she asked what's the

00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,270
difference between posting photos on

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,670
your personal and your business I have a

00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:06,829
personal Instagram account I have a

00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:09,140
personal Facebook account

00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:10,609
that's not linked those are completely

00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,079
different photos think about it that's a

00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:14,210
completely different target audience

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,950
that's your family and your friends with

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,329
every single thing you do the first

00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,250
thing that you need to be asking is

00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:21,740
who's your target audience and as long

00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,299
as they're not I go to a lot of websites

00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,130
and they actually forget and they have

00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:27,650
the link to their Facebook but it's not

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:30,049
their business it's their personal so

00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:31,760
just check little things like that you

00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:35,240
got to show your personality though even

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:38,180
in your business photos you know so if

00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,160
you're taking really good images you're

00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,619
only gonna want to post those just those

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,200
but yes you can have personal photos on

00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:47,599
your on your personal but know that

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,319
employers have gotten really smart and

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,210
they'll Google you and I was sitting

00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:55,430
with some attorneys at the time I

00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,869
usually go to the clients office and

00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,549
I'll wait all day just as people are

00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:00,890
coming out and get their images because

00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm there on their time and they were

00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:06,440
actually looking to hire somebody and I

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,599
saw them they were googling people while

00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,150
they can't hold that against you people

00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,210
still do that so you don't want those

00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,579
drinking photos like my poor husband we

00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,770
actually reenacted link actual LinkedIn

00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:20,359
photos my poor husband so that holding

00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:23,390
the drink and that was an actual

00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:28,820
LinkedIn photo so yeah it was another

00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:31,590
question in the back ok

00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:36,840
it's very nice to see you again oh it's

00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:39,930
nice to see you too oh thank you I have

00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:42,750
been a business and training coach the

00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:46,650
better part of 30 years I'm a licensed

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:48,300
are certified life coach as well so when

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,520
I'm dealing with the business owner

00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,240
who's getting started or somebody whose

00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,240
job change

00:40:53,470 --> 00:41:00,460
my career I have always reminding them

00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:02,380
to them good example was the young lady

00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,530
straight-a student previous daughter's

00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,540
Pike private college as she went out on

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:10,780
spring break and they showed her in a

00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,180
wet t-shirt along with a drink in her

00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:16,060
hand and she had a job offered from

00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,260
multiple schools and every one of them

00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:21,550
disappeared

00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:24,369
yeah so even though you think well my

00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:28,300
business life is very structured ultra

00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:31,329
professional everybody searches for who

00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,859
you are in the world today 80% of people

00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:38,470
are going to research you online before

00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:40,599
making that decision yeah and they can

00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,890
even type in your phone number and find

00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,290
you everywhere they can type in your

00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,079
email address and find you everything

00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:49,150
that pops up I'm actually very careful

00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,829
about even who I friend on LinkedIn as a

00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:53,500
photographer that had those really bad

00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:55,900
images I have found out that if I

00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,990
comment on or a friend of them if

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:01,450
somebody Google's my name their profile

00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:03,849
photos from LinkedIn actually pop up as

00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:10,020
part of mine that's how powerful the

00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:10,020
Internet is yeah yes

00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:21,410
learn lighting natural light here's a

00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,320
good example to see if everybody can see

00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:26,630
see how dark my face is on this side

00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:31,760
three dollars from Walmart then my face

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:35,150
just light up on that side right just

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,860
learn learn lighting the further into

00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:41,090
the room you go the darker something is

00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,820
taking this and putting this in half

00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:45,680
this is the size that it comes I always

00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,930
cut it in half if I'm taking a shot of a

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,140
product I set it down I bounce light

00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:54,380
back into that into that product three

00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,120
dollars will significantly improve walk

00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,270
over towards the light if harsh light is

00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:02,120
coming in shower curtain sheer curtain

00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:09,140
just diffuse that light and then bounce

00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:18,260
light back into the sea do you see the

00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:28,040
difference say I'm dark yeah any other

00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:33,110
questions so what type of products

00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:35,540
industrial hoses I actually worked with

00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,580
a box manufacturer recently they make

00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,440
all the boxes for any product you see at

00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,000
Home Depot like little boxes of screws

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,830
and stuff so that's actually pretty

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,810
exciting so is it in a warehouse just so

00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,420
it doesn't look like everybody right is

00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:53,180
it in a warehouse yes open up the bay

00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:55,190
door yeah let some light come in bring

00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,540
it back where it's not harsh you know

00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,970
you take photos you have like a bright

00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,800
white spot just light use too harsh kind

00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,300
of bring it back and at least get that

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,430
all-important photo that you'll need for

00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,720
like Amazon or anything like that and

00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,720
then who is your target audience

00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,310
hydraulic

00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,990
right now can they sling it over their

00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,720
shoulder and maybe take a product photo

00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:19,160
showing like the guy with the the thing

00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,020
on his shoulder because it's actually

00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,770
showing it in use

00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:26,180
what's its final product what problem

00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,600
does it solve where is it at what does

00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,390
it do

00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,880
suction axes and suctioning water

00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,440
discharging water as an example

00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,160
it's like city streets or something like

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,170
that so city street flooded and then go

00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,060
lay the hose with it dry and you've

00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:43,280
solved the problem you're showing the

00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:46,810
issue and how your product actually

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,810
solved that problem

00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:52,990
if you need more help grab a card I'm

00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,990
gonna open a book you can text me

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,620
rafi implementations

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:15,260
well I thought I did pretty well today

00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:17,060
with it going walkies that's why we have

00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:20,390
that hero image to make it really big

00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:22,880
and you also want to make sure that the

00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,619
photo is gonna look better smaller and

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,450
so the one thing that I tell my clients

00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:28,099
with photography is once you get it up

00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,320
there and you decide it's kind of still

00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:32,510
hard to see just take a step forward and

00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,250
take the photo again take a step forward

00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,599
because as you get closer that whatever

00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:39,160
that is it's gonna get bigger and bigger

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,050
then you're really gonna tell that story

00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,820
and then resize it a lot of times before

00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,220
you ever get it up there so that nothing

00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,470
goes awry you can do that in your

00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,119
computers all kinds I'm not a tech

00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,920
person but there's plenty of people in

00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:53,540
the room they'd probably be able to tell

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,630
you the different apps and software that

00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:58,340
will resize photos since I do it myself

00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:01,609
I don't use those but there's some

00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:03,050
really good do you know any three sized

00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:05,270
pictures I'm gonna put you on this

00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:07,099
business mark do you know any the resize

00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:09,170
photos before they ever get up to the

00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:12,320
you can use something simple like canva

00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:15,050
as you know the dimensions Adobe spark

00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:19,310
yeah yeah there's there's tons of them

00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:22,910
there's ones even plugins and WordPress

00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:24,650
that will resize your photos for you and

00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,200
compress them and still keep them

00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,730
looking clean and crisp and not and a

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,380
lot of times when people take pictures

00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,970
with their cell phones they think that

00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,910
it's gonna look good blown-up as a

00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:36,349
billboard it's not that's why you really

00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:38,240
want to hire a professional if you need

00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:42,349
something really big it's gonna be blown

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:45,560
up crisp and clear and then stabilized

00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:47,690
if you it's a little just even like if

00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,800
you just take your phone I don't know a

00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,180
lot of you probably see me running

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,650
around the camera all weekend you'll see

00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,740
me I'm always like up against the wall

00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,910
I'm stabilizing myself I'll even put the

00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,400
even the camera up against the wall

00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:03,670
figure out a way to stabilize and make

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,670
sure you're taking a photo that's clear

00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:11,220
resize them for the internet yeah you

00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,589
want to resize them for the Internet and

00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:16,470
then when you talk with your web person

00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:18,300
they'll know the size of that box that

00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,520
is there you want to go ahead and have

00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,050
it sized for that box but you still want

00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,359
to keep the original in case you decide

00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:26,400
to use it somewhere else and then the

00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:28,170
great part of having images and not

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,089
wasting your time is you can repurpose

00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,190
that that can become a Facebook banner

00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:34,050
that can be this place you can crop it

00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,820
you can zoom in and the little piece of

00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:38,099
it can be something else so when you

00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:55,980
have the high resolution images you can

00:47:38,099 --> 00:48:00,330
do that when you call the photographer

00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:03,330
do they ask you questions it's all about

00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:05,700
you when somebody calls me and they say

00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:07,440
I need images for my website the very

00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,990
first question I asked them is who is

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,450
your target audience because I want to

00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,650
make sure that I'm capturing that not

00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,960
just throwing you up against the wall

00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:17,640
and taking your picture who's your

00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,920
target audience do you need to lean

00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:23,790
forward do you need to be the judge that

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,099
is stoppable do you you know figuring

00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,990
out who your target audience is so when

00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:31,859
you call a photographer if they don't

00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:33,890
ask you questions they're really not

00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:37,589
gonna do right for your business and

00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:38,940
then that's a good question because I'm

00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:41,160
usually the one usually asking all the

00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,650
questions when somebody calls me so I

00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,720
usually say who is your target audience

00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:48,540
what is your branding what are your

00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,369
works and let's make sure we're

00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:55,130
capturing that either in your products

00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:55,130
or in your images with people

00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:06,790
so you can probably type in an an iPhone

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,080
mirror image and it will flip and if you

00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,790
have an image you want me to mirror

00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,470
we've got about two hours before the

00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,610
after-party you can text it to me and

00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,610
I'll flip it and you can look at it

00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:22,420
[Music]

00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:35,520
grading so

00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:52,790
you can right-click on the stock photo

00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:54,530
online and do Google search or 10i and

00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,330
it will tell you at all the other places

00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:58,520
that it's available on the internet

00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,770
before you use any image you just want

00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,380
to go through that checklist because

00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:04,940
again what resonates with your target

00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,340
audience might not resonate with my

00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:09,200
target audience so I can't say what's

00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:11,330
going to work or not work for you like I

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,820
said the buck stops with you you have to

00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:22,070
decide who your target audience is is

00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:25,370
that image going to work for you who's

00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:27,050
in control okay

00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:29,840
can you sit down and have a meeting with

00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:37,070
them and explain to them and mmm I feel

00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:39,380
you I know with maybe you can show them

00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:41,960
a really bad photo and then show them a

00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,730
really good photo maybe you could take

00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,680
the Clint Eastwood photo and say what do

00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,850
you what do you say when you look at

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,990
this image what do you see what do you

00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,210
see when you look at the stock photo

00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:53,810
because what if I had come in here just

00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:55,100
immediately said when's the last time

00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:57,590
you judge something based on how it

00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,540
looks no hand would have gone up right

00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,220
so maybe if you just like show them a

00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:07,990
couple of images and say here's what our

00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:11,200
site can look like so yeah anybody else

00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,200
one more

00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:32,520
thank you you're welcome the more

00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:33,990
question yes no I sit down with them and

00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,040
I brainstorm with them

00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:39,750
so again who's your target audience I

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,550
check out their website and I look to

00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,960
see what's not working and what is as

00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,150
soon as I know who their target audience

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,130
is who they're you know what is their

00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:48,390
branding what are their words what it is

00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:55,320
they're wanting to convey to the world

00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:57,300
and then I have them do this and then

00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,060
I'm able to I have to climb inside their

00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,800
head I that's my job I have to climb

00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,990
inside their head and help them figure

00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,510
out how they can connect with engage

00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:08,100
their target audience but figuring out

00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:10,470
who their target audience is like the

00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,200
photo you know the book editor the

00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:15,060
attorney like both were good images but

00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,510
which is going to be right for your

00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:21,420
company so figuring out those little

00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:25,320
details is really really really

00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:27,720
