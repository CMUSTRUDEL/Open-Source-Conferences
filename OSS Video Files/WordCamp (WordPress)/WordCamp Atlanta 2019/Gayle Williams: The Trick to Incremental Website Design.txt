Title: Gayle Williams: The Trick to Incremental Website Design
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	The term “incremental website design” was first introduced to capture the reality of constant new content creation and adjustments inherent in the inbound marketing methodology. Gone are the days of building the website and leaving it alone for months on end. This workshop will focus on packaging and selling monthly retainers for incremental website design and maintenance specifically for small business owners. We will discuss contracts, monthly strategy meetings, goal setting, and the array of service options, and pricing.
Suggested questions:
How do you manage expectations and control scope creep each month?
What are the downside risks of incremental design?
When is it best not to suggest incremental design?

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:17,190
seventh Ward camp this season and so far

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,980

wonderful so thanks for for being here

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,000
this morning and I'll try to keep the

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,369
energy up and I'm going to rely on you

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,980
to help me with that

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,359
the trick to incremental web design

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,120
we're gonna talk about a few things but

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,130
first let me do real quick a little more

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,410
background on me I'm from Orlando

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,770
Florida although I live in Sarasota

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,170
Florida now and I was born there before

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,020
the mouse y'all know what I mean

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,550
it was before Disney and it was great it

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,390
still is good but I wouldn't want to

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,489
live there I'm actually trained as a

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,820
performing classical musician I'm a

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,670
flutist and for many years ra and for

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,489
many years I was a principal flute of an

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,409
orchestra yeah it was really cool I

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,390
loved it but it never really paid all

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,049
the bills so I developed some other

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,000
skills so I could do this and while I

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,909
was at it I'm also a music critic for

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,460
The Herald Tribune so this is imagine

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,710
this this is the oldest school thing you

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,159
could do I'm writing about classical

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,650
music in print you know for print

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,229
newspaper although they do have online

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,939
sources but it I love it

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,040
and it's fun so it's just a little

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,720
sideline something I do when I'm not

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,780
doing all the other stuff I do which is

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,229
I've been in marketing for most of my

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,140
career marketing and education but as a

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,329
marketing consultant I've been doing

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:54,450
that for about 20 years and I've owned

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:58,770
my own agency now streamlined just me

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,479
for 11 years so I've been through a lot

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,700
of things I've been on the client side

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,210
I've been on the agency side I've been

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:12,230
on the freelancer side and I was doing

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:15,650
all of this from about 2001 which was

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,769
nations before WordPress and on through

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:22,340
this whole digital evolution which means

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:24,440
I've seen a lot of things and I am boned

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,879
tired of keeping up with everything but

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,800
I still have kept up with everything

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:35,989
y'all understand that so I'm still doing

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,060
this almost watch it anyway that was not

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:41,510
planned all right this is what we're

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:44,060
going to cover today gonna just take a

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,500
look at website design redesigns the

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,099
reality check of what that looks like

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,099
and talking about the definition for

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,840
incremental design who here knows just

00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:57,590
knows exactly what I mean by incremental

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,540
design okay just a few handfuls we're

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,819
gonna go we're gonna kind of circle

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,430
around this topic so that you have an

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:08,510
understanding of the various legs it has

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,870
and what it can mean for you what it

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,760
could mean for your clients and then how

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,739
to implement it so that you don't get

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,870
yourself in trouble and then that you

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:23,780
keep your clients happy

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:26,269
sound good awesome website redesign you

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,220
know it's been my experience that I

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,870
frequently get approached by a client

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,510
who says oh my gosh

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,049
we built our website five years ago six

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,519
years ago we haven't touched it it's

00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:40,280
yeah we don't we don't want it anymore

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,819
so we'd like you to build us a whole new

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,030
website now if it's really old they

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:49,100
really do need a whole new website but

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,989
if it's something where they've we built

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,810
it two three years ago we haven't

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,989
touched it and but it's built in

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,900
WordPress but I want you to build a

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:03,470
whole new website and by the way I only

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,400
have a thousand dollars to do it okay

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,919
I started having that conversation about

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,180
doing it a little differently because

00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,609
tearing the whole thing down when the

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,160
structure is good when we know with a

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:19,070
wordpress structure good hosting

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,169
environment you've got that foundation

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,630
and why do you want to tear down all

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,350
those pages and lose whatever search

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,610
engine visibility and credit

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,740
you have let's let's keep it but this is

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,160
a graph of what we have been seeing for

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,970
many years you build it you spend the

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,710
big budget item you coast and then you

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,990
do something big because the marketing

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,010
department or the owner finally goes I'm

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,410
getting complaints about the website and

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,300
you can see if you think about the best

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,720
websites are always getting better and

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,530
better with time you lose your momentum

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,750
and it's been my experience that a

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,470
website left alone doesn't just stay

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,670
static

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:09,290
it atrophies we all know that right

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,290
that's why we have maintenance programs

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,690
it is also my experience that another

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,550
big problem is that our clients don't

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:23,040
really understand this whole website

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,910
structured construction what it can mean

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,560
for them and so they approach it like

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,790
this one big project we're all going to

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,980
have to have committees or I'm gonna

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,780
have to really spend a lot of time

00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,410
working on this that I don't have

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,280
because I'm running my business and so

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:43,830
they they spend a lot of time in angst

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,440
trying to figure out what they want and

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,830
they don't make a lot of decisions they

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:54,180
think it's going to be a big budget

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:57,360
ticket item and they procrastinate or

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:02,220
they hire you and then they make you sit

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,440
while they're deliberating and oh it's

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,130
money and this time and there's a bit of

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,640
fear in it so you have to think about

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,950
that

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,280
when you're talking to clients usually

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:17,310
those are all right there although they

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,140
may not say they're afraid but they are

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:25,650
afraid of the money they are afraid of

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:27,390
all those decisions they have to make so

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,300
we're going to come at this from a

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,160
totally different standpoint money

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,170
Python fans

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,710
yay so we're going to come up now for

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,300
something completely different I'm gonna

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,840
sound like I'm going off on a tangent

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,850
but Kaizen it's used in industrial

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,170
settings this is a phrase that you learn

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,940
in MBA classes

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,650
Kaizen in Japanese means small

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,680
incremental improvements continuous

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,440
change for good and I think of it like

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,480
bonsai tree you don't plant a bonsai

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,320
tree and watch it grow you have to

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:10,290
continually care for it to make it be

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,570
what you want it to be so Kaizen then we

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:15,120
have the incremental or reiterative

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,100
design process that is taught to

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,980
engineering students and project

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,830
managers in industrial settings and it's

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,630
also for software development and these

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:29,280
software developers in here who are

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:33,810
familiar with this yeah it's it's so

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,490
common sense it is so common sense you

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,750
figure out the initial planning and and

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,820
too often initial planning requirements

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:45,060
analysis and design implementation and

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,540
then you shake hands you get your check

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,200
and you walk away from a client and they

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:57,980
don't benefit from testing and deploying

00:07:52,200 --> 00:08:01,230
new content and evaluation and new ideas

00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,750
so what you see I'm going to continue

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,020
with this I'm taking the trends in the

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,960
process that have been in place and in

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,530
action for years in the business

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:17,340
community and we're putting them to use

00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:21,210
in our little world Eric Ries the Lean

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,040
Startup how long ago is this a New York

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,680
Times bestseller it's it's been a while

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,470
but the Lean Startup a lot of talk about

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,340
that and the big part is build measure

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:36,330
learn feedback loop it's the same thing

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,280
just different words really important

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,870
for continuous innovation and

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,540
improvement and now any hub spotters in

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:49,490
here anyone

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:56,430
Wow yeah yeah okay I became a HubSpot

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:59,310
agency partner in 2010 and that was

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,770
still fairly early in their development

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,360
and one of the big things that we were

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:08,790
all being trained to talk about was

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,010
incremental website design and in their

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,470
training in their world what they were

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,600
talking about is I'm just gonna throw

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,970
out numbers you build the initial

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,350
website it's gonna be $10,000 build that

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:26,700
website and then get them on them client

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:29,880
get them on a monthly retainer for

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,890
developing new content tweaking a be

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,200
testing all of this evaluation and

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:41,880
continue continue your adding content to

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,090
the funnel and this was the way that a

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,790
lot of agencies really grew it's not

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:56,490
that they kept that initial website

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:59,610
build down to a real beneficial level

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,530
for the client they it was a way to

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,100
really build your business and it's a

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:07,200
smart way to build your business I'm not

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,060
against it but this is when I first was

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,500
introduced to incremental website design

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:16,260
but the reality of my clients was they

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,130
have a budget like this and they're

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,810
trying to build something and when I say

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,330
okay we're gonna build this and then

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,810
we're gonna do all sorts of than that

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:29,520
but I thought that the concept of

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:32,060
incremental website improvement was

00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:37,400
something that was so important just for

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:41,820
my clients to understand how a website

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:45,660
needs to grow and evolve and I wanted to

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:48,240
move them away from that belief that we

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,860
build it and then we kind of ignore it

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,170
for a while while we do the rest of the

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,050
business I wanted to get them into that

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,210
every month looking at how's my website

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,220
doing what's it what's the conversion

00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,580
rate

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,570
what can we do to help it build more

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,630
business and here the guys at wider

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,640
funnel made this wonderful graph and

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,570
this is really what we want rather than

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,450
that stair step thing we want little

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:21,140
bits of improvement all the way up so

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:24,320
that ideally for my clients I'm helping

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:29,390
them build their search engine

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:32,180
visibility their content base testing

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,700
their calls to action probably kind of

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,970
building the productivity of their

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:43,780
website ongoing and you know long beyond

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:46,400
this that's my goal for my clients

00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:50,750
anyone in on that do you think that this

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,280
is what you want to do okay yeah no no

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:56,390
we just want to let um atrophy then they

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,890
come back to me so I begin this

00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,630
conversation with clients I start

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,810
talking about when they're saying I only

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:07,550
have a thousand dollars to to build a

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:10,040
website I'd say okay let's look at this

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,590
in a phased approach what do we need to

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,200
have initially and maybe if it's an old

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,660
website I and I've done this and it's a

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,790
little cumbersome if it's an old website

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:25,910
and I have to flip it over into a more

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:29,300
robust theme or building the environment

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,450
like Divi or whatever I will flip the

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,830
whole thing but I'll really focus on

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,750
making sure that their homepage they're

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,860
about their contact maybe the services

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:46,160
the core pages are really strong first

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:52,130
and then for the next phase and paycheck

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:55,430
or whatever they can budget we do more

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:58,880
we get into product landing pages or

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,220
whatever detail they need and then phase

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,110
three this is an example you know we

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,530
memorize my tree aliy start activating

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,060
their content marketing aspect of their

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:12,080
website if they're going to be doing

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,700
that and this makes them

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:19,200
relax a little bit like I don't have to

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:24,290
do all of it at once I can stage it over

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:27,710
time this helps me it helps them

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:32,610
I'm not overloaded with a huge website

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:35,430
design I also get money in phases rather

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,460
than feast and famine a bunch of money

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,950
than none for a few months it's all good

00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,710
very important when you're a freelancer

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:49,170
or a small agency is to be looking at

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:51,480
ways to deal with your cash flow so this

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,500
is actually something I've been doing

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,430
more and more lately

00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:01,410
I had an orthopedic surgeon who had been

00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:05,670
with a large medical practice and later

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:09,510
in his career he wanted to just go solo

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,730
and have more of a concierge practice me

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,770
and he really didn't have a lot of money

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,360
at first because he was submitting it's

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,270
like a startup he was spending all this

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,430
other money on all the other things he

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:25,520
needed to set up a separate medical

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:30,930
practice so I agreed to kind of like a

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:35,730
larger initial payment not quite 50% but

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,650
a larger initial payment and then spaced

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:42,560
out the rest of the payments over six

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:47,280
months there's a risk to this as we know

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,950
because if you do this and the client

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,640
disappears on you you've already built

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,820
off a lot and they're gone so I'm very

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,720
careful to vet these folks and make sure

00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:04,110
that there's language in my contracts

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:07,770
that absolutely make this clear what it

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:10,590
is and I try to impress upon them that

00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm doing most of the work here and then

00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:17,550
you're paying on in in payments for that

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,890
suit that you have on you're still

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,890
