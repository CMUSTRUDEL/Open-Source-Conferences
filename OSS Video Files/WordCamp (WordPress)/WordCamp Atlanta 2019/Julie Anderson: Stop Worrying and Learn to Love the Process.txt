I'm Julie Anderson I'm a project manager

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,270
with sideways eight we're a digital

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,240
marketing firm in Atlanta in the Atlanta

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,960
area but we do work all over the country

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,920
and I've been there for about two years

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:19,320
so that's kind of a brief background but

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,449
when I know a lot of times people just

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,640
worried so much about starting a project

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,080
and getting through a project and one of

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,170
the things that I found helped was

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,359
making processes so which I love trying

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,910
to say a million times um so that's why

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,410
I started this I wanted to do this talk

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,469
let's see if I can get this thing

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:43,440
working we may or may not there we go so

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,920
what we're gonna cover is basically what

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,520
is a process why you need one how you

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,469
should develop one next steps and

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,660
Thanksgiving I'm a big analogy person

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:59,340
I've got to have an analogy Thanksgiving

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,500
has put the 1 for this so as project

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,870
managers and who in here is a project

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,240
manager like that's your main role ok

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,070
and then if you're on your own

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,890
are you also managing your own projects

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,409
as well ok yeah so you guys were two

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,750
hats I try not to wear the other hat so

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:21,840
but project managers always want to talk

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:27,960
tools you know are we sorry do you do

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,490
use JIRA or Trello teamwork what's

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,689
evident know if anybody uses the new

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,770
Monday one or just scraps of paper

00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:40,229
somehow you have to keep track of your

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:43,189
project right but the truth is that your

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,750
process means more than the actual tool

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:47,909
and you need to determine what's going

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,590
to work for you and your team before you

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:55,470
actually choose a tool ok so let's talk

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,750
about what is a process so I had a you

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,000
know go to the go to dictionary.com and

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,280
look one up right it's a systematic

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,719
series of actions directed directed to

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,459
some end so it's repeatable steps a

00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:11,190
roadmap to create a site essentially and

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,800
I'll I am will share my screen my slides

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,000
at the end of as well as some templates

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
you don't have to do all that if you

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,670
don't want to yeah we've got a link for

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,450
that

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,420
so just repeatable steps things you can

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,670
do over and over but we tell our clients

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,440
that every project is unique right and

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,610
we don't work on an assembly line

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:36,030
so are these repeatable processes even

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:41,150
necessary does this make sense yes and

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:43,260
no okay there's lots of similarities so

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,370
there are lots of similarities and that

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,910
we there are a lot of steps we should

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,520
take or we do take but we really should

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,870
take in order for every project to me

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,840
this is like Thanksgiving different

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,910
dinner you may have different people

00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,540
some different foods but lots of

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,330
similarities so when you land a project

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,710
after you celebrate right what's the

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,270
first thing you do when the contract is

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:11,370
signed what's next skipping way ahead

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,080
what do you do to launch the site you've

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,750
got to have a process all of these

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,610
things are the same for prop for each

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,490
project you need it written down and

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:24,840
ready to go okay so why do you have a

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:28,190
process knowing where to start and how

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,790
to finish having a repeatable

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:36,270
customizable process will allow you to

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:40,020
start quickly not miss the important

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:43,740
stuff handle more projects at a time

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,840
that's making more money right evolve

00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,800
find you find your mistakes and move on

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:54,750
to it not make them again and then also

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:59,610
go on vacation I leave on Friday for a

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:03,810
week so as on the side when I first

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,790
started at sideways eight one particular

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,140
co-worker used the word process process

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,800
process all the time

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,239
and Previn is crazy in fact another

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,010
co-worker and I decided that we were

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,080
going to start a drinking game and every

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,200
time Brett said process we were gonna

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,609
take a shot hahaha you know great well

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,740
instead of becoming alcoholics and

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:27,360
getting fired we decided to actually

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:30,000
codify what we were already doing

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,009
analyze it and then grow from there so

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,770
it's been a year and a half process of

00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:40,229
building processes but and that's how I

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:42,659
came to love processes okay so how do

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:45,659
you develop your process for your team

00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:49,759
okay to me you start with the big

00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:54,680
picture overview and for any project

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:58,439
you've got onboarding discovery

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,979
design-build Quality Assurance user

00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:05,129
acceptance testing launching in

00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:07,050
evaluating I used this process for

00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:09,060
Thanksgiving dinner I use it for home

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,849
improvement projects drive my family

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,189
crazy but we have something going

00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:17,580
through all the way through we know what

00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:20,789
the next steps are okay I put evaluate

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,810
last but I honestly evaluate often

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:26,370
through the project stop every couple of

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,529
weeks and say what went right what went

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,379
wrong write it down because if you've

00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:33,690
got a project even if it's only a three

00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,250
month project you're not gonna remember

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,469
something that went wrong at the

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,389
beginning you don't you you're blocking

00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:41,219
it out you don't want to make that

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:45,000
mistake in the next project so write it

00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:47,520
down as you go along okay so the first

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,930
thing you do is onboarding so this is

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,360
like planning your Thanksgiving dinner

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,900
who are you going to invite what do you

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,659
want to serve things like that okay so

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,490
for us what accounting software do you

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,719
use that's the first thing we do is get

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,029
the clients in the accounting software

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:05,610
because you know when it's time for them

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,509
to pay you you want to be ready for them

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,819
to pay you yes

00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,949
so then you assemble your team and make

00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,839
sure they're all on the same page we

00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,750
have an internal meeting with our with

00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,279
our staff to know you know if you're

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,990
gonna be my designer and this is a

00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,849
really small project you need to know

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,639
this is only going to be five or ten

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:25,680
hours if it's gonna be huge and I'm

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,449
gonna need you 40 hours a week for the

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,879
next three weeks I need you to be able

00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,669
to sign off on that so everybody has to

00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:37,259
totally understand the project really

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:38,849
review the proposal okay we are you know

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,770
the sales people we have a sales person

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,220
they send out their proposal I look at

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,530
it before

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,600
goes out but I go back over it with a

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,670
fine-tooth comb and makes sure that we

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,900
have touched everything I would say even

00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,510
if you are the one who wrote the

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,950
proposal go back over it list it out

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:57,660
what have you promised to do okay at

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,240
this point I set up my milestones and

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,430
tasks based on the proposal this may

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,410
change as you go through discovery you

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,970
may find other things that you need but

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,580
make sure you set up the tests and

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:12,720
milestones just kind of a preliminary

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:14,850
elimin airily the the launch date is

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,650
pretty far out you're not really going

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,290
to be sure of that milestone and when

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:23,340
that is but set it up is and explain to

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:26,100
the client that it's tentative don't let

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,790
them start you know by an air time to

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:33,090
their based on your launch date we'd set

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,740
up a communication plan as well I'd like

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,860
to have all the information in one place

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,990
the one time I didn't have the phone

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,460
number of our client like two days

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,020
before we were supposed to launch and I

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,540
couldn't get a hold of her I sent her

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,919
emails she didn't respond we had to

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,260
delay launch because I could not get a

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,410
hold of her I write because we do all of

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:55,560
our check-ins via conference call so I

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,240
just didn't have it so I write it all

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,740
down I also make sure they have it I

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,780
call it the communications cheat sheet

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,760
they have everyone who's on their team

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,740
they have linked to our to the projects

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,000
everything's right there and again I

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,050
have a template for that that I'll share

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,770
at the end and start determining who you

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,470
will need to be consulted for approval

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:22,590
this is something that I stress over and

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,180
over is nothing like finding out that a

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,000
board of directors needs is going to all

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:34,860
chime in right before launch had that

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:39,440
happen oh all right so see if I can work

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,440
this thing there we have

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,990
the other thing you want to do is start

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:51,040
a racy chart loosen cards so racy stands

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,740
for responsible accountable consulted

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,100
and informed we've really just started

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,710
using this and I love this the first one

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,150
you make your heads gonna spin but then

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,670
you start handing it out and people love

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,190
it responsible is the person who's

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:09,340
actually going to do the work not the

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,590
project manager okay so who is the

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,060
designer who is this content strategist

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,290
make sure that they know what they're

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,920
gonna stand for or what they're going to

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,120
be doing accountable is most usually the

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,090
project manager I've got to make sure

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,920
that work is getting done consulted as

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,550
anybody you're going to talk to to make

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,350
sure that they are there their input is

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,980
taken into consideration

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,990
so and then inform is somebody who just

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,560
wants to know what's going on but we

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,210
don't need their opinion so here's an

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,490
example like I said the first time you

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,170
make one you know your heads will spin

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,110
and I do give you a template for this as

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:50,620
well by the way so when we begin the

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,440
site map that's we have a Content coach

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:57,720
which is the greatest invention ever um

00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:02,530
she walks the client through this the

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,120
how the site map should be set up so she

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,620
does that but we also talked to the

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,200
digital other to the designer and

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,090
developer on the team we talked to the

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,280
digital marketing strategist and of

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,380
course the client is consulted so those

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,870
people are consulted content coach is

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,270
responsible and the project manager is

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,570
accountable you should always have

00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,730
somebody who is accountable sometimes

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,580
especially on your if you have a small

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,770
team the accountable responsible person

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,930
is probably going to be you that's why I

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,110
use roles instead of people at the top

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,210
so if you are the designer developer a

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,550
designer or developer and the project

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,740
manager you'll be responsible in one

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,550
area and accountable in the other okay

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,290
so like I said these I have a great

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,510
little template for this and you're more

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,640
than welcome to try it out but you just

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,220
put your tasks down the left hand side

00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:01,630
and I'd like to do the big breaks like

00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:03,820
the milestones in the middle yeah and

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,350
then this was there was a whole bunch on

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,390
the client-side so yes there should be a

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,810
responsible and accountable consulted

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:13,990
and informed is kind of you know

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:17,530
optional but yeah responsible and

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,150
accountable on every row like the list

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,060
of the functionality I don't think I had

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,920
an accountable for that and I should

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:32,470
that's really me I do both those things

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:34,690
so you could split the box I would you

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,230
could almost split the task like who's

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:41,020
gonna be responsible for writing it and

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,880
whose upon responsible for I don't know

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,590
I haven't really done it it's except

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,510
that I would do um you know I've really

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,800
honestly I have not done that but I make

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,870
sure there's at least one responsible

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,930
and I think because it's me I know if

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm responsible I'm also accountable

00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:06,240
because I'm in charge of the project

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:06,240
okay approver okay

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,649
well and I think you could also do

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:20,230
develop like we have developed style

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,630
guide approved style guide and then that

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,940
they would be responsible so you just

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:31,389
add another task as well but that's a

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:34,079
good idea okay okay so for discovery is

00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:36,639
our next step on every project this

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,889
going back to my Thanksgiving analogy is

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,930
developing the shopping list to make

00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,029
sure you know who has allergies what

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,949
this is people need to have associated

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,750
with Thanksgiving I mean you know we all

00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:49,389
know we have to have mashed potatoes my

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,709
children believe that even at 21 and 23

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,980
that they have to have some sort of a

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,870
whipped cream jell-o salad thing so you

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,519
know it's not Thanksgiving if that's not

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,510
on the table that's got to be on the

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:05,079
list right okay so back to digital

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:08,320
projects I have a list of questions that

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,000
I run through with my team on my own

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,709
just making sure we've covered

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,079
everything before anybody starts

00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,930
designing a building okay so we go

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,569
through this huge list if we are not

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,120
sure if we think the client has told us

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:24,459
or think they may have told sales we

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,980
reiterate it back to the client

00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:29,290
there have been times when when we

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,940
thought the the sales person told told

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,250
us that the client wanted a they

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,410
actually wanted B we needed to clarify

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,290
that in Discovery so we just say you

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,120
know you know Brett told us this Brett

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,170
you know and then they go oh yes that's

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,730
right and it's all fine but so this is

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,170
just a little bit of the list of the

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,560
questions again then I share with you

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,389
guys that you'll want to build on things

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,579
that you that make more sense for your

00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:57,100
own team but what key messages will be

00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:59,410
communicated what's the one thing we

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,240
want people to do feel you know and so

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,730
asking the client about that at the

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,040
beginning and really getting that down

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,420
there's a lot of functionality questions

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,800
as well okay so we make sure that we go

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,510
through that before we really start

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,339
talking to the client and then when we

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,600
get onto the discovery call with the

00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,339
client we're not wasting their time

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,380
everybody knows what they need to ask

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:24,300
and we're good to go we've got

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,300
open up my rolls too so that helps too

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,280
so at the if you've got something more

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,290
than just a basic brochure website

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,270
you've got some functionality going on I

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,790
bring my developers in to gather the

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,930
requirements I think I know everything

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,960
and I can ask you all the questions

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,330
these guys have built stuff that you

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,700
know make my head spin so they know the

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,130
questions to ask but even if it's a

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:52,330
simple site I have found that we need to

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:54,190
ask about contact forms we generally

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,810
just build a contact form where if you

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,850
filling out a form on the site you get a

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,480
thanks you know there's just a note on

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,520
this on the site well we had one client

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,460
we were launching and he realized that

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,170
it didn't send an email and so you know

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,330
we had to stop and do that so if you ask

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,870
what do you need from your contact form

00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,980
where is it who's it going to go to um

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,800
what kind of reaction do you want from

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,160
the club from the from your client so

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:25,030
just get really specific les will come

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,460
up and bite you later on we finish with

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,560
a signed statement of work when we first

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,150
started our proposals were considered

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,010
our statements of work we go through a

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,320
discovery and a lot of things would

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,600
change and then we wouldn't have it

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,410
written so we do the proposal and then

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,150
we do the statement of work in that

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:46,710
again I specify who's going to approve

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:49,720
each milestone lesson learned

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:52,270
specify the rounds of revisions all

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,370
right I did have a client make a very

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,320
good point to me once about rounds of

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,060
revisions rounds of revisions are not

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,040
you made a mistake and you need to fix

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,890
it you as the person who's developed

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,720
it's they want to change something and

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,190
we have made mistakes I'm like oh that

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,350
was a round revisions he's like Tim it

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,960
wasn't you didn't follow the design yeah

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,760
you're right so but specify how many

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,960
rounds of revisions because we've also

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,460
had a guy wanted me to change the

00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:22,710
picture about 25 times so on to design

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,710
and my Thanksgiving I got it you know

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,990
make sure for for me design would be all

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,970
of your recipes are printed out because

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,640
you know you can't you got to be able to

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,939
hand them out the day you're cooking

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,189
everything's ready

00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:39,579
everybody's approved all the silly

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:42,309
little nuances are nailed down you've

00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:45,369
chose the colors of your of your

00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:48,429
tablecloth you picked out the China all

00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:51,999
those kinds of things for us in in our

00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:54,069
everyday building projects because we

00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:56,889
now with WordPress we do most of our

00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:59,739
designing in the browser we don't do as

00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,659
much with the PS PS DS anymore but I

00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:04,389
still want to give the clients something

00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:06,250
to look at what kind of general idea are

00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:08,379
you they going to have on the page so we

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,209
don't do the full-blown PS DS but we'll

00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:12,639
do AB wireframe or what we call a text

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,539
wireframe to me this is the time when

00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,889
you start talking about the

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,809
functionality that's going to be on the

00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:19,959
page you're going to you know this is a

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:21,250
picture and it's got donate and it flips

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,500
over and it tells you something about

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,699
the donations this is when you tell them

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,819
that you're not going to do a slider

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:31,360
because sliders are silly you know

00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:34,419
they're gone don't don't do them we've

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,070
also started doing mini brand guides if

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,570
your client has come to you with a big

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,779
brand guide I mean some of the big guys

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,279
come with these huge 30 page brand

00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,110
guides and you've got oh my god who

00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,899
thought of all this we just do a two

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,779
pager for our smaller clients and they

00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,919
love them they just put down the fonts

00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,360
that we're going to use kind of use some

00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,070
of the content that we're planning on

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,429
using so they can see what it's going to

00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:00,129
look like we give them the color schemes

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,750
if they don't have one already and then

00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:04,539
we kind of pick out some images some

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,129
stock photos that we feel represent them

00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:07,539
what they want to have the look and feel

00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:09,909
and we just give them it's a two pager

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:11,909
they a lot of them use it for other

00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:14,679
media other things that they use so

00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:17,259
other promotions they're doing so that's

00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,360
really been great it helps us hand

00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:21,549
things off within the project for other

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,049
people working on it but it also helps

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:27,549
the client alright

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:30,730
so build now we're cooking our dinner

00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:34,090
right the first thing we do is set up a

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,490
staging site we add all the plugins at

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,139
this point because that gives you more

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,059
time to find out what plugins are gonna

00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:41,679
fight with what other plugins okay

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,419
because it's nothing like adding a

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,769
translation plug-in at the end and

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:46,580
finding out that it's going to you know

00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:48,500
jump all over the place on

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,910
with beaver builder or whatever else

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:56,240
you're using okay we build some and we

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,290
show the client some people start

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,670
building and they don't want to show

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,650
anything and they want to finish it

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,250
clients understand this is a process

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,540
okay so we do the homepage where you get

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,120
them to sign off on the header the

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,000
footer and the homepage before we move

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,600
on make sure I show it to them in

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,510
different screen sizes as soon as we are

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,040
ready to do that because different you

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,809
know they might think the order should

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,610
be different on the phone so just go

00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:26,290
ahead and build it some show it to them

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:29,690
if you get approval on the phone call

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,370
make sure you write a note afterwards

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,920
that says just to confirm you said the

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,490
header looked great you know glad you

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,920
liked it

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:42,429
we're moving on it just keeps it clear

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,490
then you build some more okay

00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:47,809
continually check your sitemap and make

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,040
sure all of the pages are getting done

00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:50,090
we had one where we thought we were

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,790
almost done and we realized there were

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,230
ten more sub sub pages like oops no

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,960
that's but the launches are going to

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,500
move back a little bit and then we get

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,700
weekly updates we do them on the phone

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,590
we do a conference call we'll show

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,920
things we do weekly updates throughout

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:11,690
the project but we also do know status

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:13,850
reports okay so I started off with the

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,890
project vision just so you know we know

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,860
the client knows we know what they want

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:22,429
done we talked about the project health

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:26,780
what's currently if it's good average or

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,460
way behind what we're you know kind of

00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,770
where we where we are in the projects

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,590
there's a quick overview what week of

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:36,679
this this one was week two of eleven and

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,870
we were 15% in those should coincide if

00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,340
you're at week eight and you're 15% in

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,860
you and the client need to have a talk

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,670
and they bill but they'll see it right

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,110
there what we've completed this week

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,480
that's usually several bullets but it

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,370
wouldn't fit on that um if we're in the

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,950
middle of a project several bullets but

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,200
that wouldn't fit on the slide what we

00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,299
complained what we plan to complete this

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,159
week if nothing else that holds

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,889
us accountable you know we've got our

00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,269
internal project plan and whatever but

00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,950
we're telling the we're telling the

00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,749
client we're gonna get you these three

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,409
things by the end of next week you can

00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:13,970
expect that issues and roadblocks what's

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:15,919
the main thing that we always get

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,309
blocked on with with projects what holds

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,059
your project up is it you content still

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:24,259
need content for this page in this page

00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,789
bright orange and because that's our

00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,279
company color I've actually sometimes

00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:30,669
used a client's color if it's something

00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:33,499
that they're due that we need from them

00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:35,840
just another couple of coming tasks and

00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:38,029
milestones and then I'm trying to avoid

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,600
talking about tools but I've linked to

00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:42,950
our tool or project management tools so

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,489
they can be provided of the full

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,619
milestones and where we stand and giving

00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:50,779
them links to it toward the end I also

00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:54,200
give them links to the staging site on

00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:58,220
the bottom of that if you're doing a

00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,980
hourly project I'd do this instead of

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:04,190
underneath the health we do this little

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:07,429
block and I just showed you need budget

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,200
hours actual hours so if you've got a

00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:10,970
month Lea retainer or something for

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,230
somebody this is what and then I just

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,279
put down what we've already accomplished

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:18,350
for the month and what we're playing to

00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:23,889
accomplish for the month okay internal

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:27,739
QA who has a checklist for internal QA

00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:30,200
yeah and do you yeah so

00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:32,269
and I've actually provide you one in the

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,549
old templates something for you to start

00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,470
with this is not something that you you

00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:42,499
need to build your own but start with

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:44,960
something some internal QA can be like

00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:47,440
in some ways when you go shopping and

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,580
you know you've got a checklist oh

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,379
you've got a shopping list and you run

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,059
through must be hungry or something but

00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:54,409
you run through the store you know

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,840
pulling the things that you need and

00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,220
then you look at your list and go oh man

00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,359
I forgot to I forgot to get the

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,879
spaghetti on aisle five

00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,139
and you go back and get it we all know

00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,309
we're gonna look at the header we're

00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:05,929
gonna look at the footer we're gonna do

00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:08,840
it but there are some things oh shoot I

00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:11,929
forgot to check Internet Explorer which

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,120
if you have corporate clients you still

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:15,370
need to check in Internet

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,820
because they're still stuck in Internet

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,170
Explorer I customize it by the client

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,580
like I said you know if it's corporate

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,260
and I know that they use Internet

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,350
Explorer internally a better check in on

00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,300
that before I send it to them and then

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,640
project specific ones I don't

00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,640
necessarily do a user story because that

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,670
unless it's a huge project but hey we

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,860
need to make sure we double-check that

00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:42,550
this this plugin is working this way

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,440
just kind of add to it within within our

00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,330
team we use team work and within our

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,800
project management tool I'll just add

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,010
another task in there just to make sure

00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:54,670
I remember okay make sure you're

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:56,140
updating it as technology changes and

00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,120
then remember what's burned you in the

00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,560
past just stop before you send it out

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,360
before you sign off on it

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,370
what What's in burned you in the past

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,910
what are you would you be embarrassed if

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:09,040
the client saw okay

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,450
we had some temporary picture in one

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,190
time and I went to send it went oh no we

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,080
need to take that out before me it was

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,490
just something goofy teen thing and I

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,970
think now we need to put at least some

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:21,130
sort of stock photography in when you

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,920
send it to the client

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,930
give them specifics okay so right now

00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:31,300
we're working on a project where the

00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:33,100
there is a ecommerce / part and so I'm

00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,290
going to make sure they have pretend

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,090
credit card numbers you know they're not

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,370
going to think to do that and they can't

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,600
they shouldn't be putting in their their

00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,180
real ones with because you don't have

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,490
SSL setup right so give them specifics

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:48,690
and not you could go as far as user

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:52,210
stories if you've got a big enough

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,490
project but even just tell them pretend

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,350
your client checking out here

00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,260
pretend you're a client scheduling

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:02,260
something and just ask them to think

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,270
that way also we're in the business we

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,360
know to check on every different screen

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,770
they don't they don't think that way

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,510
they'll pull it up on the first device

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,070
you know then they get your email that

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,990
says go in there they're gonna pull it

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,830
up on the first device and then they're

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,660
probably not going to check in on

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,130
anything else and I'm not it maybe it's

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,690
we're in the business we should know

00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:24,760
that remind them and this goes back to

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,080
the revisions rounds of revisions we

00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,830
don't want a boxing match with our

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
clients

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:32,710
but you might as well like hold up the

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,120
Sun and say this is round one hey we're

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,770
ready for your first round of revisions

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,800
let us know what you need

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:41,530
oK we've addressed that ready for your

00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,390
second round and then they it's very

00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:45,190
clear and all I say I had a client tell

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:49,450
me I had no idea I was I had

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,040
overextended and so that was my my

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,760
miscommunication I didn't want to be so

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,970
specific and that wasn't fair to him all

00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,350
right

00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,350
so launch

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,810
[Music]

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,610
okay so launch back to my Thanksgiving

00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,980
analogy is putting everything on the

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,540
table right so you've got to go back and

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,000
look at your menu make sure you didn't

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:17,110
leave the broccoli in the in the

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,370
microwave been there so even though you

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,370
have done this a million times

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,750
you need that checklist again like the

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,580
shopping list in the store go back and

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,470
you'll find something that you forgot

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,020
you do not want to be caught with the

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,210
checkbox for discourage search engines

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,830
three months from now that's not good

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,480
and but that's you know something you

00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:42,160
would do on autopilot but make sure

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:45,120
you've done it and then again change it

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:49,840
as you as you learn from your mistakes

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:52,510
okay evaluate like I said I do this

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,730
throughout so you know we had some issue

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,920
with a design the other day I went down

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,990
writing in immediately and set up and

00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,310
wrote something down because I know I'm

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,320
not gonna this cut this project that

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,330
we're working on right now it's if it's

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,510
done in six months I'll be amazed so I'm

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,800
not gonna remember that right so if

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,800
you're really brave

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,420
ask the client they want to tell you

00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,520
what ask them what do you feel like we

00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,800
did well what do you think we could

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,200
improve in they want to hear that I mean

00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,640
wouldn't wouldn't that make use look

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:26,620
better you know you're trying to get

00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:29,140
better ask them ask your team what do

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,460
they like what do you like what did they

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,890
like about the project what did they not

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,300
like about the project we have a lessons

00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,570
learned meeting at the end of every

00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,549
project what we're supposed to we've

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,129
planned that it's in our process

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:44,049
um if you've got a large team and you

00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:47,320
want to do it anonymously as a survey

00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:51,519
that might help because they might be

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,820
more forthcoming look for ways to change

00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,289
and improve okay that's really what it

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,369
comes down to you know and one of the

00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:59,529
things I forgot to mention about the

00:27:57,369 --> 00:28:02,409
team some of the best advice I've gotten

00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:05,019
is from some of our contractors because

00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:07,029
they are they see other things and saw

00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:10,559
how other things have been done so

00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:13,419
they've really been helpful to ask them

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,320
so you know this is the storytime part

00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:18,489
some of the lessons we've learned

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,730
thoroughly bet any other party involved

00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:24,279
we've waited months for logos we have

00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:27,519
waited months for marketing messaging

00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:29,049
materials we had one guy tell us that he

00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,429
could do anything with the stream that

00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,039
was supposed to incorporate into our

00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:35,379
site and that ended up really being a

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,989
problem it delayed the project by almost

00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:39,399
five months so really know who you're

00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:42,340
working with I would suggest if you have

00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:44,440
some other external that somebody else

00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,179
you're depending on build them build

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,149
them into your AC chart and include them

00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:50,230
in that because your client your client

00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:52,090
needs to note because they're the ones

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,710
probably paying for the other company

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,330
they need to know where it's coming from

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,739
and they otherwise they just feel like

00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,619
they're being tossed between two people

00:28:56,739 --> 00:29:01,059
and you don't want them to be that way

00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:03,759
all right

00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:05,619
get everything in writing love when you

00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,809
have this really nice point of contact

00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:10,419
and they say oh it's no problem we don't

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:13,600
have to do a let's do B B sounds good

00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:15,399
and then you do B and her boss comes

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,889
back and says heck no we're doing it

00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,989
doing a and it's that was what was

00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:22,869
writing writing so guess what we had to

00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:24,220
do a and B so get everything in writing

00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:28,179
and make sure you know who should be

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,950
approving that one of the nicer things

00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:34,029
we've learned is that we allow clients

00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:37,029
in to make some changes before we hand

00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:39,190
it off so while we're still building the

00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:41,470
sub pages they can go in and do make

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,659
changes to some of the upper-level pages

00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,340
one it makes them feel more comfortable

00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:47,230
when you hand this side off and one of

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,570
the reasons we use a content management

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,220
system is so that we can hand it off to

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,149
the client we want them to feel

00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,729
comfortable when they

00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:58,759
when you hand them the keys we do

00:29:55,729 --> 00:30:00,259
install a plugin called stream so which

00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,659
does let us know if they start deleting

00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:04,369
pages and you know we have to restore

00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:07,070
them or if they've made major problems

00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:09,830
but it does allow them to feel more

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:13,509
comfortable before we get before we hand

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:17,659
it off all right so that's our process

00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:19,309
where do you start I would say start

00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:21,529
with what you have you know it's not

00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:23,570
perfect but you know you have some ideas

00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:27,169
of what you do on a daily basis a weekly

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,330
basis write it down all right you know

00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:31,659
it's not going to be perfect that's why

00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:34,729
you have the evaluation part all right

00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:36,979
start with the overall broad plan the

00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:41,769
one that I use for everything onboarding

00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:44,899
discovery design build Quality Assurance

00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:51,859
your user acceptance testing launching

00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:54,739
and evaluating get specific include

00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:59,239
template links in your process okay so

00:30:54,739 --> 00:31:02,179
like the one where we use for the other

00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:03,979
sorry project update in my process it

00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,899
says here link you know set this up and

00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:07,549
it links straight over to that template

00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:11,950
so if we make changes to the template

00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,950
it's easy to get to it's all right there

00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:19,609
as you build your process get get input

00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:21,379
from your coworkers find online

00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:23,509
resources and I provide some links to

00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:25,489
these guys but I use a girl's guide 2

00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:27,320
p.m. she does more than just digital

00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:30,739
marketing marketing but she's got all

00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:34,609
kinds of great suggestions and templates

00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:36,499
the digital project manager this guy's

00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:39,559
saved my life I probably would be in a

00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:41,960
hole by now I actually took a class from

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:44,839
him last fall and he does a podcast and

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,899
I live which I listen to on the way down

00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,820
here and so it's got all kinds of great

00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:53,539
resources highly selective because

00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,070
suggest his work track your mistakes and

00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:58,700
again I'm going to give you a template

00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:02,299
to do that keep going and keep updating

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,309
and if all else fails remember why you

00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:06,380
have a process in the first place ok you

00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:09,450
want to be able to hand things off

00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,039
so that as your team grows you know you

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,299
got another project manager this is

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,149
