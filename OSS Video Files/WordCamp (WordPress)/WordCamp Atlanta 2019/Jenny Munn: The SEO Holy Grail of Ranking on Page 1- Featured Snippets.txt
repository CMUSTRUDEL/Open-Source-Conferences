Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	What is a featured snippet and why should you care? If you woke up today thinking you can succeed in SEO doing the same thing you did yesterday, you would be wrong. In 2019, the answer to ranking at the top of Google and driving more traffic is this: optimize for featured snippets (aka “Position 0.”). Come to this session and find out what featured snippets are and how to optimize for them, how to start showing up for voice search, and how to drive more traffic without creating new content or getting more backlinks.

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,030
one like I'm talking a big game right

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,649
like we're gonna have to I'm gonna have

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,210
to really prove myself on why this is

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,950
such an important topic but it is very

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,899
specific we're gonna get a little bit

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,230
tactical and a little bit technical and

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,180
a lot nerdy right because it's SEO so

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,059
let's go ahead and get started I am

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,370
Jenny Mun and this topic is ranking on

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,780
page one featured snippets and when

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,549
people were asking me what I was talking

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,869
about I was like well featured snippets

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,640
thinking that everybody knew what that

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,510
was but I was really surprised the

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,909
amount of people like what does a

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,580
featured snippet so that is the topic of

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,790
the day so what we're gonna be

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,670
discussing is the evolution of SEO and

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,409
really why recent changes have kind of

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,299
culminated and in what we're seeing

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,100
today and why things are the way they

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,710
are and and why this is such an

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,140
important topic we're gonna be talking

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,689
about featured snippets 101 the who what

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,549
why where when how all of that

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,320
information to really provide you guys

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,439
with a good comprehensive overview on

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,450
this and then I give lots of case

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,979
studies and examples as a hopefully none

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,390
of my clients are in the room I mean I

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,040
know they're not but hopefully they're

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,600
not because I give a lot of

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,220
behind-the-scenes information which i

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,140
think is really important and talk about

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,509
the approach that I know organizations

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,630
have used or that I've used myself which

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,950
have or have not worked so that's going

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,409
to be today there will definitely be

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,360
time for Q&A again at the end if you

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,159
want me to expand on any particular area

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,160
because I will be talking about terms

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,229
like backlinks and click-through rate

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,530
and some specific data so again if your

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,270
loss to make sure to to ask at the end

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,740
as well so just a quick note about me

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,870
WordPress and WordCamp is very near and

00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,420
dear to my heart because I started out

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,490
my dream 10 years ago now as a website

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,260
copywriter and when I say and I launched

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,000
my business I pretty much like hit

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,130
publish on my website my beautiful

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,140
wordpress website that you see over here

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,360
which I totally I took some trademark

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,840
images with the coffee cups like in the

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,209
steam going and I pretty much have the

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,950
happiness bar of technical geniuses to

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,430
thank because I came to my first word

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,840
camp in 2010 I believe and I plunked

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,760
down my laptop and I was like help me

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,310
because I wasn't technical but thank

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,220
goodness for WordPress you don't have to

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,690
be it just so gives you so much power to

00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,470
do wonderful things like this and to

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,180
follow our dreams so I quickly had my

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,130
website up I waited for all the business

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,870
to come to me business does not just

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,640
come to you just because you published

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,520
your website right which I totally

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,989
thought it would and so being an

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,459
introvert I didn't want to have to make

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,070
cold calls I didn't want to have to

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,110
network and I you know you do have to do

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,790
that I did end up doing that but I also

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,640
found out that what people were telling

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,810
me was they googled Atlanta copywriter

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,610
and that's how they found their

00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,790
copywriters and so I figured out and

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,410
this was again 8 9 10 years ago I had to

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,780
get up to the top of Google in order to

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,870
get more clients and avoid that up and

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,640
down that many freelancers often face so

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,280
fast forward I started teaching others

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,100
how to do SEO today I'm a Google partner

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,750
which is for ads I speak on behalf of

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,450
AMA and part of their faculty for their

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,480
digital marketing conferences and I work

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,769
with clients in the k-12 education world

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,690
ok so enough about me

00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:56,540
let's get to the evolution of SEO and

00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,980
website traffic and I've got four trends

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,620
I want to talk about today so back in

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,110
the day the SERPs which stands for

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,049
search engines results page was pretty

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,120
basic right but would you guys say that

00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:13,329
is it a fair statement to say that SEO

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,940
has changed a good amount over the years

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:17,820
yeah and this is where we get the term

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,230
that

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,400
and little blue links if you've ever

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,770
heard that because this was pretty

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,620
cut-and-dry this is what the results

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,710
looked like in google but fast forward

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,990
to today this is a search for organic

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,390
meats that was back in the day this is

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,090
the current view for what it looks like

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,490
for organic meat today okay so pretty

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,520
different so let's explore some of these

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,110
elements if you googled organic meat

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,820
again depending if you were logged in

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,230
what your search history is what

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,450
websites you've clicked on where you

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,270
live your results may or may not look

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,970
somewhat like this so the very first

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,920
thing we see is you know one two three

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,100
four ads okay and this is one of the

00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,750
biggest changes over the years you know

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,610
people get so mad at Google but Google

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,070
is a for-profit business the way they

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,110
make money is through ads so a couple

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,570
years ago the ads used to be kind of off

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,250
to the side and the right column now I

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,720
think what the changes being mobile

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,850
first everything is streamlined

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,770
Google is definitely prioritizing their

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,170
ads so they take up a very prominent

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,470
chunk above the fold of the search

00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:25,140
engines results page so you see for ads

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,970
you also see Google shopping ads as well

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:32,130
okay so that takes up the whole first

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,900
half then you see the map result and

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,370
local listings underneath that which is

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,340
so interesting and this has happened

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,070
also a lot over the past year or two I

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,290
didn't type in organic meat Atlanta I

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,810
didn't type in anything geographically

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,460
orienting the search but I do think that

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,950
Google is trying to interpret the intent

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,260
of people and what they're looking for

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,490
this search is kind of ambiguous so

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,650
they're like well let's throw the map on

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,930
there I have a client ranking for

00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,700
organic pecans and it's his map result

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,050
that comes up which is very you know

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,300
it's again it's kind of strange but I

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,670
see this more and more and a couple

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,590
years ago I stood up here and I said the

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,630
number one worst keyword you could ever

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,430
try to target was the word weight loss

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,350
okay because you're never gonna beat out

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,270
the big companies who are ranking for

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,950
that keyword and say hey I stand

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,620
corrected because you google weight loss

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:22,590
and you see local Atlanta again based on

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,040
where you are you see local results okay

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,980
so never say never okay so you see the

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,440
local results right very interesting

00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,080
then you drop down and you get your very

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,140
first true organic little blue link

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,360
listing just just one of them and then

00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,970
you get the PAA the people also ask

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,650
search box okay and I feel like I see

00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,560
that feature do you guys see what I'm

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,380
talking about that little toggle can't

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,820
see yet but you open one and then a

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,860
couple more drop down and if you open

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,900
two or three forget it like the Gordian

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,790
style takes up the whole screen which I

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,290
like that that's pretty good and as a

00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,730
side note you should pay attention to

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,860
those key words because those are words

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,630
that Google is emphasizing as good

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,140
keywords you might want to target for

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,600
your topic

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,130
so you see listing number one with a

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,030
pretty big Meta Description right and

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,740
then you see people off their app then

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,090
you can see the arrow which is a little

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,820
bit more than halfway down the page the

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,370
page that's when you finally see the

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,130
listings for spots two through ten okay

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,660
so very different before you even get to

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,610
the website results which is where we

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,320
want to be you have to get to a lot of

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,330
you have to get through a lot of

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:35,190
information and most people just aren't

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:37,890
getting that far anymore okay let me

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,380
show my video which is super not

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,820
exciting but I also because we're mobile

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,370
first right I just want to show you guys

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,860
what the same search looks like on the

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,380
mobile screen

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:53,510
well it didn't like that okay

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:56,630
maybe okay

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,990
I this was me recording my finger

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,800
scrolling down so not high-tech

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,470
basically I just want to show you guys

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,900
it kind of mimics desktop with a few

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,270
changes there's a couple am particles in

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,790
there there is a feature that says

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,440
stories which is articles from health

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,600
experts right there

00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,740
and you can click on more stories and it

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,540
takes you to a screen with more

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,970
interesting articles from health experts

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,740
and organic meat debates right because

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,330
what's more controversial than I said

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,830
this topic right now that's not

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,870
controversial but whatever okay there's

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,610
a lot of opinions and so the mobile

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,290
surfs looks like that too you have to

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:37,640
get through a lot of elements before you

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:40,130
get to the organic search results okay

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,860
so what this is all leading to is that

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,750
the SERPs is a very diverse place to be

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,640
besides just those features you might

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,710
see one of these other many features

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,440
that are just you know it's what the

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,210
world of SEO and and Google looks like

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,190
today so depending on the type of query

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,290
if it's ecommerce you'll see a lot more

00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,480
google shopping ads you'll see these

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,160
reviews in here if it's a local search

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,860
you'll see you'll be inundated with

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,870
local map pack results also so again

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,850
depending on what space you guys are in

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,590
you really have to understand who are

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,810
the competitors who you're competing

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,060
with that click for and this is just one

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,700
of the biggest changes is that your

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,500
website ranking on page one is not the

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,270
end-all be-all it used to be you might

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,770
have to have more videos you might have

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,660
to optimize your images and have those

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,160
more so you just have to understand the

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,940
space you're playing in and what is

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,460
ranking for your keywords so the second

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,840
trend is that Google has been very

00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,850
forthcoming which is a little bit

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,100
unusual for Google right and talking

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,690
about some of the the things that

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,700
they're focusing on and how they want

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,260
marketers and webmasters and

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,010
stakeholders and businesses to step it

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,440
up what they say is that people want the

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,630
answers to questions and they say you

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,140
know we've really changed from a search

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,360
engine to an answer engine people don't

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,160
want trillions of web pages and I know I

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,590
sure as heck don't want to go to page

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,750
two three four or five to get to the

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,940
answer that I want

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,610
one things a lot faster right we don't

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,350
have time for that so Google knows we

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,720
want the answer not trillions of website

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,040
pages so all these changes in evolutions

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,260
they've been making over the last few

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,390
years are designed to help get people to

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,340
this because Google has a lot of

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,800
competition these days I think there's a

00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,290
statistic out there that says that 80%

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,390
of the time that we spend on our phones

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,770
are spent in apps we're not spending it

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,860
on Google and we're all on our phones

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,870
most the time I know I've been Pinterest

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,090
a lot sometimes Instagram definitely

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,280
inaudible like I'm not on Google

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,230
searching for things and this is kind of

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,570
a fight that we're see going on every

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,180
platform everybody wants to keep people

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,190
on their platform so Amazon is taking

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,840
over the world Facebook is trying to

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,940
keep people in their platform a lot

00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,070
longer they're starting to roll out and

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,420
publicize a jobs feature similar to

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,070
LinkedIn because they're trying to keep

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,470
people Google's trying to keep people

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,570
and they know if they're not instantly

00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,680
providing people these answers people

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,780
are going to leave and look elsewhere

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,490
like I know that I go to my Facebook

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,650
groups a lot to get the answers I'm

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,390
rarely in Google looking for specific

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,280
things anymore so they recognize this

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,540
and they're trying to scramble to keep

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,650
up with what we show that we're wanting

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,270
and one of the things they said that

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,370
they're going towards is a queer ulis

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,050
way to get information and when I first

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,730
saw this I was like oh we're e-list well

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,280
does not mean voice search but it

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,380
doesn't what they're saying is that they

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,170
want to provide people with enough

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,110
content and in some comprehensive

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,180
answers and some content around the

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,220
topic that people can keep following the

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,230
rabbit hole without having to go back to

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,900
the search bar and change their their

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,520
search so again how can they get more

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,320
information and more and more and more

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,570
without having to type or speak

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,730
something in and I think one of the best

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,720
examples of this is this search I know

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,270
it's a little hard to read you don't

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,100
have to read it necessarily but this was

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,710
a search I did for the keyword common

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,440
core mask because I had just gotten a

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,970
new a new client there are a math

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,089
curriculum provider based out of

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,440
Australia and so one of their target you

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:07,930
know of our most important keywords is

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,760
Common Core math and so of course I was

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,230
doing my SEO due diligence I was

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,330
googling our most important keywords

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,089
trying to get an idea of do we need

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,100
videos do

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,720
need more images do we need content you

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,089
know what do we need in order to start

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,809
knocking the people who are on page one

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:25,309
off and try to get us up there so I kind

00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,949
of saw this interesting result to the

00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:30,110
right you know you're familiar with the

00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:31,730
knowledge graph and Google's kind of you

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,519
know box to the right giving a bunch of

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,499
information what I saw though was this

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,449
little feature here where it's almost

00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:40,129
like a people also asked a Corgan of

00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:42,649
other topics within common core math

00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:45,110
that you might find interesting and when

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,910
I opened it I toggled one you can see

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,800
they were providing this snippet of

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,930
information right there to the right and

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,279
I had never seen that before so again I

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,110
don't have to I could keep going down

00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,420
the rabbit hole without having to change

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,920
my query and my keyword in my search and

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,499
get all the information I could ever

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,540
want and this is how Google is trying to

00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:06,050
provide people with information to keep

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,639
staying on their platform and again I'm

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,290
not ever really surprised by anything I

00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,240
keep seeing these weird features on my

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,889
phone and in desktop and you can't ever

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,809
be surprised by these different features

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,189
but you have to be aware of them and

00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:19,490
make sure you're adjusting your strategy

00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:22,279
to meet these trends so try number three

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,529
is makes me laugh here's what Google

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,290
came out and said last year about the

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:30,649
search behavior today all of us and how

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,079
we searched and what we want impatience

00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:34,399
immediate action instant gratification

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,809
even some impulsive NIST's are just a

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,879
handful of descriptors for behavior

00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:40,879
today we are empowered and emboldened by

00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,470
information we can pull our phones out

00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,860
and get whatever we need at the drop of

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,779
a hat and in 2019 searchers want more

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,649
useful information more personalization

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:53,209
and more immediacy and I kind of think

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,429
that this makes us sound like little

00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,990
toddlers right we want instant

00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:59,089
gratification we're having temper

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,240
tantrums we want what we want when we

00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:04,069
want it what we need to think of is

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,360
business owners and marketers and

00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:08,689
webmasters and stakeholders and

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,029
organization is we can't we can't have

00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:13,040
websites that load in 11 seconds okay we

00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:15,110
can't have outdated elements on our

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,509
website I have a client with so many

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:20,240
flash player videos that don't work and

00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,829
has like that big puzzle icon like we

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,720
can have you know we can't not have

00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,360
mobile-friendly websites you can't have

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,910
copy

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,920
that's not on point and vague because

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,779
you can't expect people to go down the

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,999
rabbit hole and go to from your homepage

00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:35,100
to your blog post and learn all about

00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,420
how awesome you are we don't have time

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,040
for that and that's not what searchers

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,350
want so you have to make sure that you

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,299
really understand your consumer today

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,040
and you're meeting these needs with the

00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:47,670
search behaviors that we all have like

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,759
little toddlers and then this last trend

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:54,420
so 0 click searches is anybody familiar

00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:57,239
with this that name 0 click searches

00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,970
it's relatively new I think it was

00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:02,129
coined here by Rand Fishkin and what

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,410
this is is when the answer is displayed

00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:07,319
directly in the search results without

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:11,579
attribution or a link to the source

00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:13,589
credit so here's an example just of this

00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,420
direct answer the 0 click search you're

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,389
seeing is that this client who I just

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,029
had the math company in Australia when

00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:23,429
we meet when we talk we do our our

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,559
webcam or a screen share I know it's

00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:27,600
gonna be 7 a.m. or it's gonna be 9 p.m.

00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,999
at night because of a time difference

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,069
they are way across the world so when

00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:33,809
I'm composing times I'm always like okay

00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:35,759
well we just changed time zones in March

00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,559
did they change or did we just change

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,169
and how does that work out so I'm always

00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,809
going to Google and Google e est versus

00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:44,189
a est which is her Australian timezone

00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,379
there's several in Australia cuz it's a

00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:48,600
big country and thank goodness I don't

00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,129
have to go to a website anymore plug in

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,889
my time because that's what I used to

00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,089
have to do to do the time conversion

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,220
Google tells me right then and there

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,689
Australian Eastern Standard Time is 14

00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,980
hours and it gives me the time and I'm

00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:01,110
like okay thank goodness I can do this

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,829
now I don't have to click anymore which

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,569
to me as a consumer this is like

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:08,189
glorious right like I don't have time to

00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:10,829
click through and do a website you know

00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:14,149
converter as a marketer it's a little

00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:16,799
bit less glorious and it's a little bit

00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:18,929
scary that answers are being provided

00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,269
right there and if you can see Rand

00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:24,179
Fishkin face like he's super fired up

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:26,100
about this Rand Fishkin if you guys

00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:30,089
don't know him he is the founder of Moz

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,889
he is like the godfather of SEO he is

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,649
super disturbed by this and I put a

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:36,149
couple links here he did a really great

00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,910
whiteboard Friday which talks about here

00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,190
are some things you

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,130
do to combat this because this is a very

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,050
increasing trend that we're seeing

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,340
there's a lot of 0 click searches you

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,320
don't have to click anywhere

00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,080
the publishers information was taken and

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,210
put directly onto the SERPs I also see

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,100
this because in analytics I'm always

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,530
having to double-check my data my

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,140
mindset I'm like ok how do I measure the

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,640
growth what is the growth percentage of

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,810
analytics for this keyword and I'm

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,310
always looking at number in data and I'm

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,980
having to check myself to Google how do

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,480
you do growth percentage increases again

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,460
and it'll tell me right then and there

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,230
so in that instance again we're getting

00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,630
instant answers and it's pretty great

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,280
from a user experience from a marketer

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,550
it's a little bit scarier and you will

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,020
see these more and more so what does all

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,840
this mean all these new trends that

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,670
we're seeing it means that attention

00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,020
spans have gone down we already know

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,850
that you know there's been a lot of

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,580
studies our attention span is less than

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,860
that of a goldfish our users and our

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,320
customers and our prospects have this

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,650
mindset as well there is more than ever

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,750
competing with attention I think just

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:44,080
the changing SERPs it's just a lot less

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,700
quiet less likely we saw that those 10

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,500
little blue links like that's all the

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,300
options people have if you were spot one

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,610
or two or three chances are pretty good

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,790
and you're gonna get the click today not

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,230
so much so again a heck of a lot less

00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,960
clicks than ever and that is something

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,480
I've seen over the years clients are you

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,640
know upset they're like well our SEO

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,680
traffic has gone down and I say well

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,080
we're still ranking on page one the

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,670
ranking hasn't changed but people aren't

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,380
coming to your website you might have to

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,180
have videos it's going to be a longer

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,860
sales cycle and you're gonna have to get

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,630
your content in front of people multiple

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,720
ways things are changing and we just

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,100
have to adjust and so what are one of

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,640
those things that we can do to adjust

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,930
and that's featured snippets so now

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,430
we're going to kind of get into the

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:31,000
whole point of this talk and the who

00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:33,190
what where why when how so what is a

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,050
featured snippet this is a featured

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,810
snippet it is at its most basic

00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,180
definition an element in the SERP it is

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,400
a box that contains the answer to the

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,470
query but how this is different than my

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,930
Australian Eastern time zone conversion

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,270
is because you see

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,980
the website link right there pretty

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,670
prominently so this actually provides

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,920
attribution for people to click through

00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,300
so there is there's three elements the

00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,060
first is you'll see a little text

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,560
snippet the second is you'll see an

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,630
image and something really interesting

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,960
well I think it's interesting to note

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:09,660
about this is half the time the image

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,450
URL is different than the text snippet

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,910
URL so you have the the text result from

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,370
one website and the image pulling from a

00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,100
second totally different website both

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,140
are awesome people can click on both but

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,010
that's something that I see too so we're

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,800
going to talk about image optimization

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:30,330
as well and then the third is that

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:32,250
source attribution link so that is that

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,650
is featured snippet 101 and you might

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,960
hear me call this position 0 because I

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,330
think the term featured snippet is a

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,250
little bit too close to some other SEO

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,420
terms that I won't say because I feel

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,590
like I don't want to confuse you guys so

00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,450
I'm not even gonna go there but if you

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,790
do have a question about that after let

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,650
me know so I might call this position 0

00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:53,280
more than I call it a featured snippet

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:54,780
but but it's the same thing so okay why

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,490
again we kind of talked about why these

00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,980
are so important but let me go a little

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,300
bit more into depth about why you know

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,620
cuz I want to convince you guys here's

00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,310
some of these things that you should pay

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,340
attention to

00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:08,580
so we talked again about evolving SERPs

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,220
0 click searches those reports coming

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,570
out all the time paths interactive which

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,370
was reported by search engine journal

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,320
just came out with a study that said

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,630
younger audiences are more likely to

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,190
skip the click and for everything we

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,200
kind of know about Millennials and the

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,630
younger generation who's even you know

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,970
more instant gratification and then

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,440
maybe some of us that seems a lot less

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,820
likely right they are not gonna spend

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,560
the time to go to our website if they

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,850
can't quickly find the information they

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,400
want

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,810
in fact spark Toro which again I'm sorry

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,800
to talk so much about Rand Fishkin but

00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,660
he's awesome

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,090
this is his company he's spun off of

00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,470
laws and he did a study reported also by

00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,880
search engine journal expect I have to

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,890
say that so there's some credibility to

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,710
it

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:53,970
34% of all desktop searches result in no

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:56,010
click on mobile 63% of users never click

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,350
on results ok so that's a little bit

00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,750
right we're working so hard to get our

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,030
content found invisible and people

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,550
aren't even going to click on it right

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,720
so that's happening the second reason

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,640
and I'm going to go into a little bit

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,080
more about the second and third voice

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,120
search and higher than average

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,780
click-through rates that come along with

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,180
this featured snippet position 0 so

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:20,430
let's get in a voice search a little bit

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm not going to talk too much about it

00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:25,080
besides it's funny it just seems to be

00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,640
this like mysterious topic that nobody

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,080
knows what to do with everybody's

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,800
talking about it but nobody knows how to

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,080
make it actionable

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,170
and us SEO is you know we're still

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,270
trying to figure out what we do with

00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,340
these smart devices and voice search

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,110
right now how you optimize for voice

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,580
search is getting to the top of Google

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,160
and trying to get into these featured

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,370
snippets and I'll give you this specific

00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,690
example so I have a client I consult

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,760
with occasionally they are called

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,410
brainscape I went to high school with

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,180
the founder Andrew and they're in New

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,860
York and they're like one of these ten

00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,600
year old startups gave they've been a

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,290
startup for ten years which is probably

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,090
pretty common right and he was saying so

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,500
they do online flashcards and they are

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,710
super lucky they've got a lot of

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,750
user-generated content which is on super

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,320
specific terms a lot of longtail terms

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,050
they rank so well they have certified

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,630
flash cards like they have bajillion

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:20,190
like a backlink like an SEO dream of

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,360
like what a backlink profile looks like

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,940
and they rank for like hundreds of these

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,680
featured snippets okay and and he was

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,870
all sad because his biggest competitor

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,940
ranks for thousands and so that's like

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,110
first world SEO problems right like he

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,110
was lamenting the fact that he only

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,300
ranks for hundreds of these but you know

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:42,000
again putting it all in context and so

00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,070
he was telling me that his investors

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,230
think it's super impressive when he goes

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,900
to do his quarterly you know pitch decks

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,720
and he's going to them that they really

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,430
do perform so well on SEO and he says

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,920
it's super impressive when he can pull

00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:58,140
out his phone and talk to it and Google

00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,090
reads the results so let me see if I can

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,070
mimic that and make it happen and and

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,390
the mic can pick it up just to show you

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,660
guys exactly what we're talking about

00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,660
here

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,870
what is the hardest part of medical

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,870
school

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,050
according to brainscape

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,000
the board exams to become a certified

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,860
medical doctor are universally regarded

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,010
as one of the most difficult parts of

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:24,770
medical school the first day okay so

00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,170
that okay so that's it but when it says

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,420
according to brainscape like the

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:33,340
investors are like oh yeah great job you

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:36,320
know and so so that happens I remember

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:39,440
going to a voice search event a couple

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,850
months ago at April's meetup which was

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,440
super awesome you guys definitely make

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,470
your way to the WordPress meetups around

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,420
town and and we had some smart devices

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,340
to play with and I was said to Amazon's

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,920
Alexa I said Alexa what are the best

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,380
plug-ins for WordPress and she goes hmm

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,180
I don't know what that is okay and then

00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,710
I go to Google like hey Google what are

00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,290
the best plug-ins for WordPress and

00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,270
Google so smart it goes according to

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,690
wpbeginner the best plug-ins for

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:07,400
WordPress are a lot and so you know that

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,080
well wpbeginner a very recognized

00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,490
website like obviously they're rocking

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,170
it they probably have a lot of these

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,480
featured snippets so there is a lot of

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,700
street cred that comes along with your

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,710
result being a top one that's red and

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,270
the more you can do in that as more

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,670
people or doing their voice search it

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,520
has a replaced text search but it is

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,870
growing so again that is it's the result

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,400
that's read in voice search so it's

00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,520
another reason why this is so important

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,460
okay so this is where we get a little

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,070
bit nerdy with the data higher than

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,780
average to click-through rates so here's

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,010
an example from a company I worked with

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,410
and again maybe that's a little hard to

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:45,260
read but I'll explain it they are a

00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,430
language advocacy organization so what

00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,070
that means is you know everybody's all

00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:50,750
big with steam and stem and technology

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,830
and kids need to learn and I'm probably

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,150
at the wrong conference talking about

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,190
this like everybody has to know how to

00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,780
code but this organization came to me

00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,820
because they're trying to balance that

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,680
with learning a second language is

00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,360
important there are so many jobs that

00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,060
come along with knowing another language

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,890
and so we need to get our message out

00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:10,220
there and help amplify and balance that

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:12,470
with all the same stem conversations so

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,200
I came on board and when the very first

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,350
things I saw was they had not optimized

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,779
their website in any form or fashion

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:23,870
and they were part of a larger

00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:26,210
Association so they had they had a lot

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,039
of credibility coming to them because

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,499
they were linked for lots of doctor

00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:31,879
websites they had some great backlinks

00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:33,799
okay so that was not their problem they

00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:36,620
just had never done foundational SEO and

00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,169
a little SEO could go a long way so when

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:42,019
I was making a list of URLs and content

00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:43,340
to optimize of course homepage came

00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:45,889
first the home page is the most

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,509
important page of your website but soon

00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:49,610
after they had linked to one of their

00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:51,259
core articles which was the ten benefits

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,580
of learning a second language so that

00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:55,039
was second on my list so I quickly

00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,809
optimized that one and pretty soon we

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,519
started to move on to page one pretty

00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:01,070
quickly and again the reason I mentioned

00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,529
why they had some good backlinks because

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:05,690
moving to page one pretty quickly

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:07,580
doesn't always happen if you don't have

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,190
some of the right foundational SEO for

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,600
them it did happen quickly so we moved

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,159
up to page one pretty quickly and we

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,409
were hovering around the middle of page

00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,299
one I remember doing in their monthly

00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:20,419
analytics like a month or two later and

00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:23,480
I was comparing month to month and I saw

00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:25,519
that the click-through rates went

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,200
through the roof for that same keyword

00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,450
benefits of learning a foreign language

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,999
it jumped from an 8 percent

00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,309
click-through rate to a 25 percent

00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:36,559
click-through rate and I was like ok wow

00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:39,679
that's really big we only moved up two

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,809
spots and so we moved out we were at

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,179
spot 7 on page 1 and we bumped up to

00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,799
spot 5 okay so that incremental change

00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:46,999
should not have produced three hundred

00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,309
percent click-through rate so

00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:50,990
immediately I went incognito mode and I

00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,710
googled our keyword benefits of learning

00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,990
a foreign language

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,539
and sure enough I saw that we had gained

00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:59,389
the featured snippet spot position 0 and

00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:02,119
there was no other change so that alone

00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:04,039
was like okay Wow we totally jumped up

00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,570
we were still halfway down there was

00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,399
still other websites that organically

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,889
ranked ahead of us but because we had

00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:12,230
that spot we got so many more clicks and

00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:13,429
again you think that well the snippets

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,200
right then and there why would people

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,299
click through but for a lot of searches

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,700
people do need more information but

00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:21,350
having that spot gives people such peace

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,879
of mind that okay well if Google put

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,440
that there it's an unconscious thought

00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:26,809
if Google put that there then that seems

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,980
credible I'm gonna click that we have a

00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:32,390
question

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,309
you can create that for pay for that is

00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,600
such a great point the question you guys

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,540
hear the question the question was you

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,679
can't pay for it it's not like I mean

00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,419
that would be kind of cool but not

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,450
really you know like you can't pay for

00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,190
that spa you could pay for an ad which I

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,270
don't even think the ads take up you

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,030
know most the time they don't take the

00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,309
sign nope you don't pay for it it is

00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:53,570
programmatically it's algorithmically

00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:56,600
calculated and that's the other reason I

00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:58,370
didn't want to use another word schema a

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,110
lot of people think schema generates

00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,630
this and it does not this is an

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,850
algorithmic calculation how Google

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,320
decides what to emphasize and so we are

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,700
going to talk about well how do you get

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,320
this more because you can't pay for it

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,030
you can't inject code in the backend

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:16,580
this is something that's got to be done

00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:18,260
through a few specific areas you can't

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,750
necessarily from that perspective yeah

00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,720
yeah yeah you can't you can't guarantee

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,830
it you know okay so so this is what

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,270
we're seeing here and what we're dealing

00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,370
with and I was like this is awesome

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,570
and so just continuing on with the data

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,780
again may be a little bit hard to see

00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,520
but that article it ranks for several

00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:39,110
keywords it's got really great

00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:41,900
click-through rates 30% 21% 17% forty

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:44,030
percent click-through rate whereas their

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,440
brand of course has a 68 click-through

00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,030
rate because that's the brand people are

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,429
searching on that organization they're

00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:51,770
probably going to click on it but it's

00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:54,169
up there and the clicks that they get

00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,210
are have surpassed even their brand name

00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:57,799
clicks and I see that a lot when an

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,230
article or a blog post or a piece of

00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,600
content does really well it will surpass

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,690
your brand name which for an SEO person

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,630
that's pretty awesome okay so here's a

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,970
second example I worked with an

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,260
e-commerce client a couple years ago and

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,980
they had already been through several

00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,809
SEO people they had great SEO they would

00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,510
they did they had this cosmetic product

00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:24,080
that covered up face scars and they

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:25,820
relied on SEO so heavily because when

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,190
people had this makeup you know they

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,929
were trying to give an embarrassing

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,520
topic that people don't talk about on

00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:33,440
social media like something like an

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,820
embarrassing product like a swimmin use

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,250
but we don't want to like tell everybody

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,900
we use it okay so this was one of those

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,100
where people just don't you know oh my

00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,320
gosh I love my

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,539
I make up that covers my scar from my

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,400
surgery or my dog bite or an acne scar

00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:48,080
so they didn't have a lot of people

00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,570
talking about it openly they had a lot

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,799
of customers who are huge advocates but

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,210
it wasn't something where they would get

00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,500
a lot of word-of-mouth so they did rely

00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,750
on SEO

00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,390
they had great SEO for people looking

00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,860
for makeup to cover scars and they said

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,100
okay well we aren't we're already on

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:06,620
page one but how can we grow from here

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,789
so when I came in I said okay well

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,350
you're already number one for all the

00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:11,299
keywords that perfectly describe you

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,370
what we have to do is go higher up the

00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:15,169
funnel and think about what are the

00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,970
keywords people are using before they

00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:18,470
realize they need a makeup like are they

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,240
you know and will be discovered as

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:24,110
people google the words cream

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,669
they google other treatments besides

00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,960
they ever think of makeup because that's

00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:30,590
kind of an unusual product so they

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,450
google gel and creams surgeries a lot of

00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,480
alternatives but we went and did was we

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,190
created content around these other areas

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,990
before people even realized that they

00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,000
needed a makeup and I call this sideways

00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,429
SEO so it's when you come in and you

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,320
approach SEO and growth from not

00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:48,770
directly head-on they had already

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,120
cornered the market and in scar makeup

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,860
it's coming in from what are the other

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,720
perspectives your target market has in

00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,390
mind and how can we now go after those

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,760
and introduce people to you so we create

00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:02,390
a ton of content around some of their

00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:05,630
competitor products so for example this

00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:08,780
keyword is what is this how to use bio

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,610
oil on acne scars we had a fantastic

00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,140
copywriter and I think I should point

00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,000
that out like you cannot underestimate

00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,650
the importance of having a really

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,940
fantastic writer so had a great

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,299
copywriter who knocked it out of the

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,429
park bio oil for acne scars we had so

00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:24,860
many longtail keywords start to populate

00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,570
in position one and you can see here you

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,909
can see our featured snippet and then

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,950
how to use bio oil for acne scars is

00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:33,799
getting a 40 percent click-through rate

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,059
whereas before it wasn't on the board so

00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,679
we very quickly kind of got into

00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,630
position Wan this is a very long tail

00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:40,700
keyword super specific to their niche

00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,169
and this started happening you can see I

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,370
blurt out the other keywords because I

00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,440
did with them to be mad at me that I was

00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:48,049
giving away all their secret but you can

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,260
see you know 46 46 42 41

00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:53,150
those are very high click-through rates

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,190
okay so here's the how of how we get

00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,480
into this because you know fortunately

00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,930
you can't pay for it

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,300
Google is very vocal about saying you

00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,940
know you can pay for ads all day long

00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,770
but you cannot pay to get organically on

00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,480
the top because they don't want just the

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,190
big brands like Home Depot and the Coca

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,440
Cola's of the world to dominate they

00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,000
truly want the companies who deserve to

00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,560
be there who are experts you know

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,680
smaller organizations in their niche to

00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,600
show up so let's talk about how there

00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,190
are certain conditions you know not

00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,900
every search is going to produce a

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,640
featured snippet and so this is kind of

00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,530
what you have to understand you happen

00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,290
first and foremost you have to be a site

00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,610
worthy of ranking and that's why this is

00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,680
what I say a little bit more of an

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,660
intermediate topic if you have not done

00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,220
your foundational SEO if you have never

00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,800
researched your keywords if your

00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,290
technical side of your website is a hot

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,810
mess this should not be the first tactic

00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,510
that you pursue but if you are

00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:50,510
authoritative and you you do have a good

00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,830
niche you have done some stuff then you

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,530
should absolutely kind of start thinking

00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:57,170
about this so identify a common question

00:32:54,530 --> 00:33:00,530
related to your to your area in your

00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,900
industry and the type of queries that

00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,340
are keyword searches that usually come

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,380
up with a featured snippet is the

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:10,240
questions okay these are questions there

00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:12,500
who what where when why which how best

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,300
those are the type of keywords that

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,010
they're more longtail they have less

00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,470
monthly searches but they can be super

00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,640
valuable to your organization those are

00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,410
the ones that generally right now

00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,270
produce a featured snippet not all the

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,190
time but a lot of the time and people

00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,780
are asking questions Google knows ok

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,870
people want a quick answer we're gonna

00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,550
throw up a featured snippet some keyword

00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,230
research tools I wasn't gonna go into

00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,490
keyword research a whole lot but I did

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,200
want to provide you guys with some of

00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,050
the tools and you can use to kind of dig

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,150
out and unearth some of these keywords

00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:42,350
answer the public is a good one there is

00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,720
definitely if you go to answer the

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,090
public there's a very sketchy guy on

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,430
page one who yeah sue everybody's like

00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,770
oh yeah that guy it's very strange but

00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,960
you will always remember that you can

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,940
type in your keyword and it'll produce

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,470
like it's designed to produce every

00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,880
single question around that specific

00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,799
keyword and topic that you've ever

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,779
thought about in keyword tool i oh

00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,129
is a good one also but here's the

00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:07,080
problem with some of these free keyword

00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:09,780
research tools they don't give you the

00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,359
data they don't say well how to use bio

00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:16,349
oil for acne scars produce 20 searches

00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,839
per month versus how to apply bio oil

00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:21,299
for scars you know that only produces 10

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,190
searches so you don't get the data to

00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:26,190
help make decisions and at some point

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,869
maybe it's not as important but you it

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,220
generates a list of questions that

00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:31,139
people ask her on your topic and then

00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,059
you can go and plug it into another tool

00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,839
but just to start wrapping your mind

00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:38,520
around this idea of questions and I do

00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:40,200
have a second keyword tool you could

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,450
pair along with that but I didn't want

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,470
to get too specific to this ask me at

00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,179
the end if you guys need more

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:47,099
information on how to use these free

00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,720
tools because we all like free and I

00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:51,419
have a super awesome free tool that I

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,669
use when I pair it with these Moz

00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:55,230
keyword explorer so that is free but

00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:57,359
they do make you register for an account

00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:00,180
like obviously I'm a big Moz fan and I

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,130
used to use them if you do have a paid

00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,140
account it's around 99 a month I think

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,700
for a certain number of sites but they

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,619
do how you can get access to their tool

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,990
you will get the search count but you

00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:13,290
just do have to have an account and then

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:15,839
SEM rush is who I use now but that's

00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,819
premium you can do it you can do a trial

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,020
and you can do all your keyword research

00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:21,839
and export it and then cancel your

00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,640
credit card but if you are getting

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,530
serious about SEO and it is becoming

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,599
increasingly important or you manage SEO

00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,520
for clients at some point you should get

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,349
a pretty good comprehensive tool and

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,540
that's 99 dollars a month too

00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:35,609
and that will give you of course all the

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,540
monthly search count data plus more

00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:41,819
things you could ever even want to know

00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,980
okay so tactical on-page tips so besides

00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:47,790
the right conditions for producing a

00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,400
featured snippet if it's not too spammy

00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:53,369
and it makes sense use the question as

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,160
the URL now that's provided that you're

00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:57,599
the only the only point of that blog

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,400
post is specifically to answer that

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,650
question if that question is just a

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,589
small subset of a larger article maybe

00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,390
don't do that but if you break up the

00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:09,299
question and the URL and of course if

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,460
it's not 50 words long I've seen that

00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:13,109
you know work before again it's not

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,680
guaranteed but maybe just a really

00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:15,539
emphasize

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,000
that this post answers this super

00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:20,190
specific question restate the question

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,170
and I kind of say this is gross like you

00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,210
need to regurgitate the question like

00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,400
throw up the question on the page you

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:30,180
have to put that question on to the page

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,369
physically in text use that question in

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,410
a subhead or in a title you might be

00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:36,720
able to just use it as part of the

00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,369
normal text paragraph text but you

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,089
should probably emphasize it more with a

00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:45,000
subhead so put it there answer the

00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:46,980
question in a succinct clear manner and

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,319
I've had to go back and do this over the

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,760
years because I tried I try I went

00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:52,200
against my own advice and sometimes when

00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,119
I'm describing something I use an

00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,799
analogy I try to get all clever and cute

00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,079
that is not going to work for a featured

00:36:55,799 --> 00:37:00,180
snippet you have to be clear and I

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,670
always tell people you know what is my

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,410
thing that clarity Trump's cleverness

00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,299
every single time and that is totally

00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,279
this like Google wants clear succinct

00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:10,970
answers because that meets the users

00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:13,230
needs featured snippet so be clear

00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,660
include a you know relevant well

00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,819
optimized images on your pages compress

00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:21,630
your images don't make them be you know

00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:23,789
huge upload them with keywords or a

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:27,150
keyword phrase in the file name if it

00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:29,579
aptly describes the image use alt text

00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:32,640
make sure the the copy surrounding the

00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:34,470
images is relevant to this topic because

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,940
again you saw that the image was right

00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,220
there next to the text and you can get

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,069
your images to rank you use a natural

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:44,940
conversational tone the bottom line easy

00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:47,099
to read an authoritative answer and then

00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,289
just foundational on-page SEO because

00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:51,960
you know again most of the results that

00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:54,150
are featured snippets are already on

00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,920
page one in some form or fashion it

00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,170
doesn't have to be the top result like

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,089
I've seen results down on page one like

00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,980
page seven and that's the featured

00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:04,170
snippet so you don't have to be at the

00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,270
super top but you do have to generally

00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,680
rank well and when you rank on page one

00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,829
it's usually those results that get

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,960
pooled somehow so foundational on-page

00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:14,579
SEO at a page level because if you think

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,140
there's things you do to your individual

00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:18,630
page or post and then there's things you

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,480
need to do to your overall website page

00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,829
level quality valuable unique copy you

00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,990
have to choose the right keyword

00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:27,550
selected and use it right

00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:30,340
a well-written title tag in a meta

00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,230
description thoughtful subheads scan

00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,300
ability and overall page content

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,420
structure again you can't just throw up

00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,520
all your text and big giant paragraphs

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,740
you have to have small paragraphs you

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,930
have to use concise words you have to

00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,700
use bullets or number lists you have to

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,850
break things up with sub heads and if

00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,830
you guys have Yoast SEO and this is why

00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:52,840
WordPress is just the best I half of my

00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,040
clients do have custom CMS's which is

00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,200
awful and I'm always like I don't

00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,760
understand why I can't optimize alt text

00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,470
on these images because they're produced

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,590
from some weird database that's like 80

00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:05,260
years old and WordPress just makes

00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:07,060
everything so easy so being able to be

00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,330
done by laypeople is that the right word

00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:12,280
who aren't technical you can structure

00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,140
you can use sub heads if you use Yoast

00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,080
Yoast is always yelling at me because I

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,510
had too many sentences before I added a

00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,040
sub head so the Yoast reminder is so

00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,650
fantastic when you go down that traffic

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,660
light media optimation again

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,060
optimization if you have if you embed

00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,730
videos you have to optimize your videos

00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,630
and the titles also like optimize as

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,250
much as you can

00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,020
thoughtfully don't stuff your keywords

00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,780
everywhere but optimize as much as you

00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,580
can on a page from a site level again

00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:43,720
the whole site needs to be quality

00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:45,970
valuable useful fast with clean code and

00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,040
I know like I know the web developers

00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:49,600
and all my clients hate me because I'm

00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,430
always like every month what can we do

00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,340
to speed up our websites because you

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:57,280
could never be fast enough so again this

00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,140
this does matter structured data usage

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,660
where it makes sense that's you know

00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,460
schema and in marking up the content in

00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,290
the backend so Google knows the entities

00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,170
and the type of content that are on your

00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,990
website having a good overall site

00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:13,480
Authority does help good site

00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,220
architecture hopefully or maybe if you

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,230
didn't attend Bobby's awesome session

00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,720
yesterday on site structure make sure

00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:22,600
you do catch the video because that is

00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,430
very important and then some good solid

00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,980
backlinks so again if you don't have

00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:29,680
these elements in place that's okay but

00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:32,170
just know featured snippets is not like

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,340
a beginner s you know SEO 101 like don't

00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,200
think that that's the very first thing

00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,170
you need to do when you know it comes to

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,230
SEO this is more of

00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,089
intermediate tactic it's not hard but I

00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,640
want you to get your you know your house

00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:46,220
in order first

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,809
so who so who can rank for all these I

00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,880
wanted to go through a couple examples

00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:51,740
of the approaches I used and the

00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,150
different types of websites I have so

00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,730
you guys can kind of get an idea for

00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:57,859
yourself optimizing existing

00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,780
authoritative content so again this is

00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:01,970
that Australian math company they've got

00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,980
math experts out the wazoo

00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:05,990
okay this so they had their experts

00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,569
write these like 80 blog posts which

00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,150
again is like an SEO dream to work with

00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:12,589
such great assets as I call it like I

00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,839
love when I've got fantastic

00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:16,880
authoritative content and I only have to

00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,609
come in and apply a little SEO and I

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,790
look like such a hero you know like you

00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:25,250
know I had if anybody knew Brad IRA off

00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,900
ear off does it did anybody know Brad he

00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,059
passed away a couple of years ago in the

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,589
in the WordPress community and he was

00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:32,420
like Jenny you only want to work with

00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:35,150
sites that are already awesome you know

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,470
like and I'm like well yeah obviously

00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,059
like you know I come in looking like a

00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:41,869
hero and all I did was a little bit of

00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:43,670
SEO the real attribution goes towards

00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:45,140
you know a good technical background and

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,329
the writers I can't say enough about

00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,160
having great content on your website I

00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:52,549
just come in and do a little SEO and it

00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,140
goes so far so I came in and they

00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:57,380
already had great content I went down

00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:59,180
the list of optimizing it and and right

00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,680
away I started noticing okay we're

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,109
moving up to page one this is a

00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:06,170
screenshot from SEM rush if you see the

00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:08,420
little crowns next to the numbers that

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:10,099
means those are featured snippets and we

00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,500
we won those featured snippets and

00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:14,930
position zeroes all we did was a little

00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:18,740
foundational SEO on top of authoritative

00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:21,260
content ok so here's another approach we

00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,359
use so here's brainscape again my friend

00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,130
andrew's company and when i asked him

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,559
okay well how did you get hundreds of

00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,450
these featured snippets and he said that

00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:31,940
he thinks it's due to two things the

00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:35,030
first one was a technical again he said

00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:38,750
our content our content wasn't that good

00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:40,849
it was written by interns it was written

00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:43,270
by a person who was straight out of

00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:45,470
college again these are very specific

00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:47,000
comprehensive topics on different flash

00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:51,079
cards like

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,030
you know what was why was the civil war

00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,099
started what were the three reasons that

00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,720
kick-started the Civil War I don't know

00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:59,089
so people create these flashcards and

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,950
they created this content so not super

00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:03,470
hard to come up with but it wasn't like

00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,089
it wasn't like a dissertation okay they

00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,579
had a ton of content that that was just

00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:09,319
written about some specific topics but

00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:12,200
he said what they did focus on was their

00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:13,970
technical SEO so their on-page SEO they

00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,770
had schema and the appropriate place is

00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:18,319
on their website they did a lot of

00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:20,480
internal linking and cross-linking there

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,609
related flashcards and content to itself

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,040
they really focused on their site

00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:29,240
architecture and he said that was their

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:32,329
major focus the second thing that they

00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,700
did so we they had the content they said

00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:36,800
that their secret weapon was they had an

00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,089
email list of hundreds of thousands of

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,440
people which again is a little bit of an

00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:41,210
unfair advantage but they worked pretty

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,470
hard for that so there's this huge email

00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,540
list so what they would do they would

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,730
take these bottom blog articles four to

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,170
eight twice a month and they would send

00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,420
them out to their hundreds of thousands

00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,010
of subscribers and those people their

00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,750
readers would click on an article and

00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,990
then they would share them on social

00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,310
media so email marketing I think broke

00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,349
you just wrote a blog post about that

00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:03,740
didn't you yes how email marketing does

00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:05,599
help your SEO because they amplified

00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,460
their content and sure enough and it got

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,839
shared and maybe it got some backlinks

00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,089
but I think more of his out and that's

00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:13,220
how he says because the content you know

00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:16,670
wasn't that well written but he had

00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:18,319
these two things going for it so are you

00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,849
currently ranking for featured snippets

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,319
and let me just take a look at the time

00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:23,869
okay awesome

00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:26,300
are you ranking for featured snippets so

00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:27,650
if you want to know if you like will

00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:31,190
where do I rank because I'm always

00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:33,380
checking my rankings a free tool is

00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,000
Google search console who here uses

00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,619
Google's search console sort of

00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,869
regularly okay good good and if you

00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:40,550
don't have that then make your way to

00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:43,760
the happiness bar and figure out how to

00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:45,170
get it it's a free it's a free tool it's

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,619
just like Google Analytics but it gives

00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:50,599
you more webmaster nerdy data and you if

00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,430
you're serious about SEO it's a it's

00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:55,730
non-negotiable and it's so funny to me

00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:57,140
how 90% of the people who come to me

00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,150
like they just don't have it yet so I

00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,320
feel like we need to do a good job of

00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,510
spreading this it's

00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,730
it's really the the free best way to

00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:07,100
understand how Google is thinking about

00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:09,680
and interpreting your website so this is

00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,690
a screenshot from Google search console

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,180
and what'd I tell you it what I say is

00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:16,640
usually look for higher than average

00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,080
click-through rates so I remember kind

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,970
of looking through this is an older

00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,090
client now but I remember looking

00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,230
through it and saying okay well what are

00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,760
the click-through rates that they have

00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,370
and I was like oh well they're

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,040
homeschooling client and Idaho home

00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:33,380
school laws has a 43% click-through rate

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,820
like that's pretty high so I googled it

00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,380
and sure enough they're ranking at

00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,600
position zero for several of these

00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,980
because they took the time to you know

00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,960
they want to be known as the experts in

00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,880
homeschooling laws so they went and

00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,330
created unique content for all 50 states

00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,980
and each state has its own URL and most

00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,630
of those ranked pretty well and several

00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,970
of them ranked in position zero and they

00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,320
have super high click-through rates I'm

00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,840
the only thing I say to do is maybe

00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,060
filter by position so you can see okay

00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,240
anything one through ten generally is

00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:04,010
page one 11 through 20 is page two so

00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,480
this kind of gives you an idea of how

00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,280
your keywords are doing where are they

00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,540
ranking and if they have a higher than

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,030
average click-through rate and they're

00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,830
not your brand then go Google those and

00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,200
see if those happen to be in position

00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:16,820
zero so that's maybe the free way to

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,520
tell besides of course you can just

00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,510
manually search your keywords randomly

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,250
every now and again which I absolutely

00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:24,890
encourage you to do it's just the amount

00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,510
of variations people search on these

00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,640
days that's what's hard nobody is

00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:31,930
searching the same three keywords you

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,930
know over and over yeah Josh

00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:40,990
this is organic position yep and I call

00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:43,630
it position zero but there's never like

00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:44,860
a zero it'll never say zero so that's

00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,360
something to note thank you did

00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,360
everybody Josh what was your question

00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:57,130
his question was is the position for

00:46:54,490 --> 00:47:00,430
organic or overall on the page and this

00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:02,800
is just organic okay so then here's a

00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,480
premium tool so again if you manage SEO

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,760
on behalf of clients if you're an agency

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,800
this is sem rush because again that's

00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,500
what I use but every tool I think has

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,100
really adapted to really showing people

00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:17,740
how featured snippets is is a part of

00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,410
your overall world with SEO and your

00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:23,110
keywords so again this sem rush shows me

00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:26,020
with the little crown what keywords we

00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:27,520
have that are position 0 if you see it

00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:29,230
in the second column you'll see I've

00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,730
highlighted in yellow at the bottom that

00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:35,230
means there is a featured snippet

00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:36,550
present but it's not us so this is

00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,410
another screenshot if I wanted to say

00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,610
okay well I want to win more featured

00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,010
snippets we've already done our

00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,870
foundational SEO now I want to go after

00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,310
and get more of those clicks because I

00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,160
already know they generate a very high

00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,810
click-through rate so there's a report

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,340
if you go over to position tracking

00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,740
again this is SEM rush but you could

00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,510
figure it out in any tool you use it'll

00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,060
tell you the keyword and it'll tell you

00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,740
which website is ranking if it's not you

00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,030
which i think is pretty awesome because

00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,700
that kind of helps you do more

00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,710
competitor analysis so again at some

00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,720
point when you get past the beginner

00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,830
phases of optimizing your website you're

00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,480
going to want to start targeting your

00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,430
competitors and figuring out what

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,210
they're doing right so that you can take

00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:17,440
over their spots okay so here's a free

00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,910
tool that I definitely want to tell you

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,790
guys about if you're not using it now

00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,860
Moz bar from Moz it's a Chrome extension

00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,600
and it's one of my favorite because when

00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,690
you install it you toggle it on if you

00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,880
go to any website page you you push the

00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,290
Moz bar button and it'll tell you what

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,330
is the title tab what is the Meta

00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:36,370
Description what is the page load time

00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,900
what is the canonical it'll tell you

00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,490
just all this great information they

00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,290
don't help you highlight your inter

00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,869
links on a page it gives you a lot of

00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:47,500
great information on a website page on

00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:48,490
the SERPs what it does let me let me

00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,770
show you what it does in the next slide

00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:53,110
but but talking about how here's how I

00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,940
pursue competitors and go after their

00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,670
featured snippets so we saw previously

00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,130
that we are not ranking where is the

00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,450
number one rigor in math okay it's about

00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,490
a hundred and forty searches per month

00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,530
and here's this URL over here core

00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:08,350
standards org that is Ray V in that

00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:09,700
place that I want to be so I go google

00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,910
rigor and math because I want to do a

00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,320
little bit of on SERPs analysis and

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:16,119
first and foremost you see okay there's

00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,940
the website number one you see core

00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:21,100
standards org but number two that's our

00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,590
image in there so we already won the

00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:27,220
image it should be relatively easy to

00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:30,790
take over the text snippet also right so

00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,410
I use Moz bar and I took a look what Moz

00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,110
bar does do you guys see that gray bar

00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:38,140
that's highlighted there it'll tell you

00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:39,670
for every website listing in the SERPs

00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,140
it'll tell you what is the page

00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,450
authority and what is the domain

00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:46,119
authority and how many links are coming

00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:48,010
in to that specific page and this helps

00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:50,530
me understand okay do we have a

00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:52,150
realistic chance of out ranking this

00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,290
website and taking over is this

00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,450
something that I should really spend

00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:58,210
time pursuing and again that's a little

00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,700
bit technical but when I did take a look

00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:04,630
okay let's see our result our page

00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:07,359
authority was 21 core standards org has

00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:09,190
a 52 page Authority which is a very huge

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,440
jump and the reason is it's because they

00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,960
are the governing body behind common

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,720
core and so it's gonna be very hard to

00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,220
beat them out they have a thousand

00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,710
backlinks going to that page where we

00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,359
have zero and so that might be a result

00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,859
that I should probably let go and move

00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:25,210
on to the next keyword because they may

00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:26,890
be pretty hard to beat out for that

00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:28,330
featured snippet maybe not impossible

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,750
but I'm gonna go after some easier

00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:34,119
targets in the meanwhile okay so that

00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:36,040
kind of wraps up like are you guys so

00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:39,170
impressed that I finished on time yes

00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:41,369
thank you okay Q&A

00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,900
my slides are there and I will

00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:45,660
definitely put them out on the Twitter

00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,579
handle as well so thank you all so much

00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,450
for getting up early this morning does

00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,759
then you bend a bit of time for

00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:55,710
questions Bobby are you pointing at me

00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:58,430
okay okay so I did anybody have any

00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,430
questions

00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:08,069
yeah okay so good question so his

00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:10,049
question was schema I touched from

00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:12,239
schema a little bit does it play a role

00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:14,160
at all and why I didn't want to confuse

00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,839
the word schema is because sometimes you

00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,519
refer when you do schema and add

00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,349
structured data it produces what's

00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,819
called Rich Snippets and the word Rich

00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:21,930
Snippets is so close to featured

00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:23,489
snippets I was like oh I'm not even

00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,660
going there because I know I'm gonna

00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:27,029
mess up and keep calling these Rich

00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,220
Snippets Rich Snippets are produced like

00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:31,410
if you guys google a product and you see

00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,239
star ratings sometimes you'll see if

00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:36,569
it's in stock you'll see the price

00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:39,569
you'll see if there's any reviews having

00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:40,739
a having structured data on your website

00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:42,839
is good because it helps Google

00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:45,210
understand but it still is not the thing

00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:47,249
it's good from an overall website SEO

00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,440
perspective and it might help contribute

00:51:47,249 --> 00:51:52,349
but it's very indirect it's definitely

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,650
not a direct correlation Josh did you

00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:58,680
have a question yep no more okay one

00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:01,170
more question right when Google made the

00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:05,130
change three years ago they added that

00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:08,099
fourth page slot it was both a sort of

00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:10,319
pain for me as a Google Ads expert how

00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:11,880
did you guys an SEO respond to that

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,039
because it pushed everything lower on

00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,569
the page and how did you you sort of

00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:16,950
qualify that with your clients and how

00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:18,900
do you still keep up with that change

00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:20,940
because it's still affecting everybody

00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,880
in search paid in organic today still

00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,410
yeah that's a good question so how do we

00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,109
keep up with the fact that ads are so

00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,519
prominent we have to have a lot of

00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:31,640
content everywhere and we have to

00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:34,680
educate it's just a longer sales cycle

00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,109
and so sometimes I will tell them go

00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,359
ahead and bid in PPC but but not always

00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:41,130
so it just depends on what the results

00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,749
are look we can talk maybe more it's a

00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,849
good question okay thank you guys so

00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:46,510
much I'll be hanging around a little bit

00:52:44,849 --> 00:52:47,810
thank y'all have a great webcam today

00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:50,929
you

00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:50,929
