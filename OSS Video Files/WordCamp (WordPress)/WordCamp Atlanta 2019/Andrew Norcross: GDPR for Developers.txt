hey everybody whoo oh yeah you haven't

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,400
even heard me yet don't get ahead of

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,960
yourselves so we're gonna jump right in

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,049
because this is an incredibly boring

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,410
topic at least it is for me and I don't

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,810
is anybody here an attorney you might

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,520
find it interesting I don't know if I

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,289
like you might find it interesting but I

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,410
don't think anybody else does so but

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,080
we're gonna talk about gdpr and how many

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,090
people here are familiar with it at all

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,500
all right cool cuz when I've given this

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,840
talk in the past it was right when it

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,340
got enacted and people kind of knew what

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,500
it was but you know really wanted em

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,110
into this is me that's what I look like

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,550
that's where I work the Twitter thing is

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,540
this it's a placeholder at this point

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,140
because they can't seem to get their

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,920
white supremacy under control

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,960
but I want to go back to something very

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,760
important here I want to point out what

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,190
my title says so more importantly what

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,350
it doesn't say and I also want to point

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,059
out the lack of letters after my last

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,739
name and those are important because

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,559
while I'd like to think I'm fairly

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,500
knowledgeable what I'm talking about I'm

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,790
not a lawyer this is not legal advice if

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,020
you have any questions regarding this

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,670
topic that you need to implement for

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,580
yourself please talk to the appropriate

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,170
legal counsel for you or your company

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,060
now that we've done that great so really

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,740
first off health is gdpr

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,970
because when this first came out I

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,430
thought it was just another four-letter

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,880
three or four letter acronym that didn't

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:28,530
have to care about remember that but

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,630
really gbr that is a great government

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,990
name for something that says absolutely

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,210
nothing but there's really one word that

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,030
we care about and that's data this is

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,170
everything about this is about data user

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:46,920
data in particular and that's why data

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:50,939
is worth a lot of money to a lot of

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,909
people and in particular we're going to

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,280
talk about user information we're about

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,350
personally identifiable information and

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,280
the way that you describes it will get

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,649
it a little bit later is any information

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,259
relating to an identified or identified

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:12,000
natural person okay we'll get into that

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,500
but we need to get like where why are we

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,720
here where we get here how do we

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:21,170
get here so some of you may remember

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:25,350
some of you don't but long time ago

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:27,570
about 25 years ago when the web as we

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,490
know it started to begin and everyone

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,170
started building websites almost

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,459
everybody had a focus on connecting

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,840
people with other people because up

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,070
until that point if you wanted to talk

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,500
to somebody that you knew in the past

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,610
you actually had to put forth effort and

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,750
you had to know where they live and you

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,520
had another phone number and their

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,770
mailing address and you had to contact

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,080
them in ways that were slow and hoped

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,600
they were home and you know you didn't

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,620
have to just search and click a button

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,390
but to do all that they had to collect

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,580
all this data and they had to figure out

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,110
you know everyone just started handing

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,750
all this stuff over and long story short

00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,410
they all these companies basically said

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,980
trust us with your data and we believe

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,620
them and that was a I cannot emphasize

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,900
how terrible of an idea that actually

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,180
ended up being because none of us knew

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,209
what we were doing with it and I put

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,739
myself in this group so let's talk about

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,040
people that care about this stuff

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,090
so there's 92% of people and I have the

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,380
numbers and links for all this stuff but

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,660
they care about their online privacy

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,790
okay who's the 8% like I don't know

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,360
anybody who is answer no to this

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:35,220
question if they use technology at all

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,900
so a great that doesn't help us this

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,380
one's better

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,690
only about 31% of people understand what

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,640
we do and how that data is collected

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,920
they don't understand what that data

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,989
even is they might understand email

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,630
addresses they might understand pictures

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,920
or address or credit card but they don't

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,769
understand cookies they don't understand

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,230
any of this other stuff and this is a

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,180
big one about three-quarters of people

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,209
have limited their online activity

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,950
because of privacy concerns so if you're

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,510
building websites and you're creating

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,180
client sites the idea is that people are

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,100
going to come to them and do whatever it

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,860
is you want them to do on your site to

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,250
do that they have you they have to trust

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,430
you

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,579
and according to this that might not be

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,220
the case and we're gonna go into this

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,750
because all these times we all know who

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,430
these people are everyone's seen these

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,389
companies and they all have exactly one

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,710
thing

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,560
more things but one thing in common is

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,409
that all of them have had large data

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,249
breaches so we have eBay had 145 million

00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:40,199
accounts hacked we had target with 110

00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:43,800
JPMorgan Chase with 83 million uber with

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,199
57 million and 600,000 drivers yet

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,689
anthem which is a health management like

00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,779
health insurance company that's 80

00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:54,389
million yet Equifax with 143 million

00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,969
member that one Yahoo with 3 billion

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,710
people and the thing is the numbers only

00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:02,069
say part of it because someone like echo

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,560
fast they had everything about us so

00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:08,099
that's a lot of information that the

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,330
other gets out there nothing really

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,550
happened any of those companies by the

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,490
way I don't maybe their to pay a fine

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,050
but so in since up Stewie you now the EU

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,310
is always in Europe in general has

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,270
always had a very different idea of

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,009
privacy than we have there was an

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,719
existing law on the books and the name I

00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:26,460
didn't write down and it's a lawyer

00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:29,729
thing but they took an existing law and

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,659
they started to build on top of it the

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:36,029
whole idea is that users have rights

00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:38,490
that you as a site owner cannot take

00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,279
away and for some of us that is an

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,620
amazingly bizarre concept because like

00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,009
it's my website I control it no not

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,810
really

00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:49,500
so the first one is the right to be

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,060
informed this one is what you probably

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
noticed visually on a lot of websites

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,210
that you go to part of it was that

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,219
cookie law which is a terrible name but

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,360
you know yes I agree to this yes I know

00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,830
what I'm doing you know all those Terms

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,629
of Service that you don't read and then

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,759
agree to the idea that you have to now

00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:08,960
explicitly tell people what you're

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,360
collecting what you're doing with it

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,189
who you plan on giving it to if you're

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,529
gonna give it to somebody later you have

00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,029
to go back and tell that person I'm

00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,740
gonna do something new with this

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,000
information that I didn't ask you about

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,199
last time so on and so on

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,419
also and we'll get in this a little more

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,919
later if you have a data breach you

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,180
legally have to tell the people affected

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,550
they don't have to find out you have to

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,319
tell them now the second one is the

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,550
right to data access and this is some of

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,719
the stuff that we might have probably

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,009
touched more release in the development

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:44,259
side

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:47,289
if I have data about you you have a

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:49,209
right to a copy of it more or less on

00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,009
demand I think there's a 30-day window

00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,499
maximum or something like that but it

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:55,929
has been a human readable format and

00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:57,819
that word is kind of vague on purpose

00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,559
because depending on what the data is is

00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,209
what would quantify it being readable

00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:02,860
but you can't just give them this huge

00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,849
database dump you can't just give them a

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,429
whole bunch of numbers on a spreadsheet

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:09,490
and say figure it out like you have to

00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:11,169
give them what they asked for all of it

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,509
you can't pick and choose you can't be

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:15,430
like oh well this data we want this one

00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:18,099
for back here but you you can look at

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,819
this stuff like no all of it is yeah the

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:24,399
show that's a big one there's a right to

00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:29,619
be forgotten so another little story is

00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:34,659
I deleted my facebook account in 2010 on

00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:39,699
their first privacy bug we find out how

00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:40,839
that's a feature but the so I didn't go

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,819
to a college that had it so I never

00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,749
really got into it and and so when the

00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,219
first thing happened I was like ah

00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:46,509
whatever I'll get rid of it like my

00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:49,509
parents are close by so they already see

00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,039
my son and platon have one four years

00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,749
and I made a fake account at one point

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,099
so I could do testing certain stuff when

00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:55,990
I was doing with meta tags and all their

00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,379
Open Graph stuff and then a little while

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:02,169
later so probably 2015 maybe 2016 I

00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,759
needed an account that was me so I could

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,169
use certain like me to log in the stuff

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,939
I needed to be able to use it to access

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,529
other data that I didn't want to make

00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,819
another user account for another service

00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,860
I might not ever touch again and all

00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,499
that other stuff so I got to make the

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,639
account and it will not let me use the

00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:17,259
email address that I do use on that

00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,729
account that he deleted and mind you

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,779
this is when Facebook actually said they

00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:22,629
deleted things now they don't even

00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,680
bother saying that lying about it but it

00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,059
wouldn't let me use my email address

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,579
because it was already in their system

00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:31,560
from an account that I deleted at that

00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:34,389
point say six years prior still there I

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,060
had no idea I had assumed that when I

00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,639
said yes delete this they would agree to

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,829
the thing that I just asked for

00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,779
apparently that was not the case so long

00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:45,130
story short the idea the idea that

00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:47,649
something lives online forever is no

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,160
longer true you have the right to tell

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:53,980
somebody get rid of everything about me

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,750
analytics data comments reviews

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,060
even to a degree or you know anything

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,070
that morally you know order history yeah

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,110
you need the data for your books but you

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,630
don't necessarily have to know who

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,329
bought stuff anymore ongoing ongoing

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,310
basically anything about me and you have

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:10,690
it I have a right to a copy of it I get

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,449
a right to see it and I get a right to

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,430
make it go away now some of the stuff

00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:18,730
ends up in court but yeah the long story

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,870
short is like data isn't yours doesn't

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,190
matter if it's in your database it

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,570
doesn't matter if it's in your cloud it

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,320
doesn't matter where it lives it does

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:30,760
not belong to you at best you're leasing

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,709
it and that's the thing and this is

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,600
actually a philosopher is also a good

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:36,250
friend of mine but that's things it was

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,540
never ours to begin with we collected

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,220
all this stuff we never scrubbed it we

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,620
never verified it we never validated it

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,300
we just started collecting it I know for

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,290
myself as a developer I would just

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,970
collect stuff I'm like this might be

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,720
useful yeah I didn't think about it

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,490
really but we won't talk about why does

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
this matter like why should I care and

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,190
and this is always one of my big

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,990
questions is like I have a limited

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,019
mental bandwidth tell me why I care

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:02,970
about the thing you're talking about so

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:04,959
who here knows who this guy is problem

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,850
all right so this guy's name is James

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,389
lang I probably mispronounced his last

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:15,160
name he I'm sorry he's sitting in prison

00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:16,899
he is a developer he worked for

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,690
Volkswagen he was one of the developers

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:21,819
that built the systems that was cheating

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,810
emissions testing for years they got

00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:29,250
caught it was young he is not the lead

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:32,010
developer he is not the CEO or the CTO

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,389
he was not even the decision-maker

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,880
according to the New York Times he was

00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,459
they made it a point to emphasize he was

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,350
not the ringleader

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:45,430
he was quote-unquote doing his job and

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,810
that job put him in jail so the fact

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,089
that we're just building what were asked

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,870
to be build isn't a valid excuse to be

00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:54,370
building what we do so cool maybe

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,040
hopefully possibly I might have a little

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,600
bit of attention so are we gonna do

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,250
about it so like how do we approach this

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,870
why do we think about it because again

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,100
it's it's a different way of thinking

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,140
and something that we've never really

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,890
approached so the EU defines data

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,980
differently than we do

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,900
in the US we say any information

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,450
relating to identify you know very

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,520
specific it's like it's gotta be you can

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,240
look at this one piece of data and know

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,850
that it's me

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,250
so like my email addresses by name you

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,870
can probably figure out that's me maybe

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,120
some other stuff but you know very

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,470
specific where's the EU understands

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,080
contacts and they understand data

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:33,740
aggregation so they say anything that

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,240
pertains to me which might in and of

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,240
itself be something that you wouldn't

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,940
even imagine is useful but again all

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,020
this stuff getting rolled up so when I

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,630
look at these it's like all right maybe

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,880
political opinions or beliefs some of

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,280
that stuff might end up and maybe I

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,360
don't know comment threats but more or

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,620
less like I'm not collecting this too I

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,440
don't want to know this information

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,090
about people frankly but now we get into

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,500
some secondary stuff because they again

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,110
they I add it on top of this we're like

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,050
genetic data I don't have any of that I

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,090
have my own like 20 that 23andme

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,650
there's genetic data you know biomed a

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,240
lot of people especially corporate stuff

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,480
they fingerprint readers they have you

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:18,500
you know you be keys and all that stuff

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,000
location data I store that every time

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,290
you log in on the WordPress dashboard it

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,650
pulls an IP address and that's why I

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:27,650
shows you events in your area cinemas

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:29,780
data I probably got that but it's su

00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,680
demise I'm not sure but the last one

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,700
there and that's the big one

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,720
online identifier because again that's

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,980
another word that doesn't mean anything

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,900
it's like okay why what about online

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,530
identifiers why do I care about this one

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,870
because we're gonna dig in IP addresses

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,120
mobile device IDs RFID tags MAC

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,470
addresses cookies yeah how many of these

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:57,530
things are on the WordPress tables right

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,760
now I think all but RFID tags and we ran

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,380
again this is just being collected when

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,390
you log in this isn't even being used by

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,010
anybody this is core WordPress this

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,110
isn't a plug-in this isn't Google

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:10,580
Analytics this is this is the stuff we

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,780
hold on to email addresses avatars again

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,160
all of this stuff gets pulled in and

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,520
we're holding information about other

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,990
people so yeah this applies to everybody

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,130
this is the first big thing we've got

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,640
well I don't have to care

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:26,120
now that I'm not a big thing it's if you

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,730
do business with the EU anybody in the

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,590
European Union so a side note of that is

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,330
I get this question every time can I

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,550
avoid this by simply not selling to

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,880
somebody who lives in the EU technically

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,350
maybe good luck figuring out where they

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,820
live

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,800
we have route you know you have tour you

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,370
have VPNs you have people that are on

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,370
vacation any number of things if they

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,650
live in the EU you're abiding by that

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,480
rule by selling to them and then the

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,430
other question I always get is can I

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,840
have people just agree not to do this

00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:01,370
kind of like you know we're like oh yeah

00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:03,350
sure I'm 18 no you cannot ask somebody

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,270
to willfully break the law in a place

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,760
that they live that it's not a valid

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,400
thing that they can do so no you can't

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,470
really get around this and furthermore

00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,630
we'll probably see this in the United

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,940
States

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,930
soonish because for certain companies it

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,060
doesn't make any sense for them to

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,440
segment their users it doesn't make

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,610
sense to build development stuff for one

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,020
group of people but not somebody else

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,620
you have to build an export tool you

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,060
build an export tool period some other

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,470
companies you know we'll get into more

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,910
of it later how they're applying it but

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:36,110
uh but yeah it applies to everybody they

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,640
have gone out of their way to say

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,490
doesn't matter how much doesn't matter

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,690
the size it doesn't matter any of that

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:46,490
stuff it matters to you so the first

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,080
part is being a data controller cuz

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,330
there's two main parts and I'm gonna go

00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,010
to too deep into this because you know

00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,440
basically data controllers is gonna be

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,450
you decide what gets collected you

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,790
decide how it's used you decide how it

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,380
shares the other one is gonna be a

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,570
processor and that's basically everybody

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,090
else but they do analytics on it they do

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,560
you know Jill glue you know follow-up

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,790
drip emails all this other stuff and

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,270
you're trying to figure out which one

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,080
you are

00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,700
you're probably both in some differing

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,020
is you're gonna be one and others you're

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,910
gonna be another you know you're very

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:21,620
well doing both of these things in some

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:23,870
way shape or form now this is where

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,140
everything boils down is we need to

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,900
start building things with privacy first

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,640
not add it on after the fact I've been

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,170
as guilty of that as everybody else in

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,550
that oh I finished

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,320
I need to do now let me make sure it's

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,660
secure now let me make sure does this

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,670
know the other way around now this is

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,079
not just another nice cool word this is

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,980
actually a seven-point design

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,079
methodology

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,079
sorry development methodology and this

00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:51,139
is actually required by the EU for what

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,730
they call data intensive projects now

00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,930
again I don't know what intensive means

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,940
because depending on what you're doing

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,610
is how much that is you have to have

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,350
this document it's a living document you

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,000
have to outline who has access to data

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,600
what data is being collected it has to

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,220
be done before you start so this is

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,399
basically part of your scope now and

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,199
part of your discovery and furthermore

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:16,310
regulators can ask you for it and you

00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:18,889
have to have it ready so yeah you need

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,420
to know everything if nothing else

00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:23,000
matters if everything else I've said is

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,940
boring that's fine but you need to know

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,130
what data you are collecting if you are

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,230
developing a site you are responsible

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,149
for knowing what comes into that site

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,589
now yes obviously people can install

00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,029
plugins and do stuff after the fact that

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:36,260
you have nothing to do with and that's

00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,140
understood but as a site owner

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,269
especially you have to care about this

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,040
you need to know what comes in you need

00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:44,510
to know what goes out you need to know

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,790
what's being stored where it's being

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:52,240
stored who can see it what can be done

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,240
with it everything and I mean everything

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,510
so there's the other thing that you have

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,570
to legally have and this is a privacy

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,610
impact statement it is this is what the

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,440
Viennese be documented everything you

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,319
need to say what could possibly go wrong

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,630
in terms of data collection and privacy

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,790
you need to say this might be bad and

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,900
outline what could be bad and outline

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,120
what you're gonna do about it

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,890
and everything from there now I can give

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,299
an entire talk on this thing and it

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,880
would be even more boring than this one

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:21,169
so we're not going to but again the

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,750
important thing is this is not done

00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:25,490
there's this law as they've written it

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,740
is still evolving because they

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,200
understand that technology moves at a

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,429
pace that law does not keep up with so

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,320
they've written the law in such a way

00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,750
that they can constantly add and modify

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,179
pieces to match what the technology is

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,040
now doing so like they've now added in

00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,510
parts about voice data that they never

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,850
had before because when they wrote this

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,110
thing voice search didn't exist yet who

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,730
knows what the hell you know I ball

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,040
search could be a thing lately

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,390
I don't know none of it yeah I wouldn't

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,130
have bet half the things we have now

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,320
we're gonna be things so I'm not gonna

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,670
guess what it is and neither are they so

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,470
you can't loophole out of it like oh

00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,340
well it was this one other thing now

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,520
they're still trying to collect

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,630
everything in there now some of you

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,610
probably like well yeah they're not

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,070
gonna enforce this stuff because why

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,890
they make these laws and they go they do

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,980
it to punish Google and that's fine but

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,700
yeah they do enforce it in January of

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,670
this year

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,540
France find Google 57 million dollars

00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,400
which again to Google's nothing but it

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,340
find a 57 million dollars for not you

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,080
know for not complying and that was not

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,850
the max that they could have charged

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,470
them they could charge them more they

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,630
can charge you up to I think four

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,190
percent of your gross or like some

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,350
number like they can really really hit

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,510
you hard if they want to and mighty this

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,730
is France this is not the EU so

00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,230
individual countries can all come after

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,940
you for GDP our if they really want to

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,710
if you're big enough to touch that stuff

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,470
but then you're like all right cool I'm

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:53,630
not Google I'm not Facebook I don't care

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:55,540
well the first company that got a fine

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,640
and this was in Germany they got fined

00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:01,180
twenty thousand pounds which were you

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,220
know euro where those in real money and

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,380
this was a data breach that happened in

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,960
the summer of 2018 they did everything

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,660
right they notified their users right

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,180
away they lock down all the data that

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,520
came out they had been they had their

00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,930
impact statement they did they followed

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,850
the letter of the law and they got fined

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,290
because of a data breach because

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,150
apparently whatever the data breach was

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,710
was something that they possibly could

00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,120
have avoided or I don't know

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,370
again I don't you know there's whole

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,530
companies that focus on this stuff but

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,080
the point being is they're gonna come

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,340
and they don't care who you are they

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,840
don't care how much money you make or

00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,150
don't make they don't care how many

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,040
things you sell that is irrelevant to

00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,680
them the only thing they care about is

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:50,060
user data and they only make care about

00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:52,970
is keeping them protected and this is a

00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:56,960
Phet last thing we you cannot claim that

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:58,610
you just don't know there's no there's

00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,760
no way to be working in technology and

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,140
not be aware of all the

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,110
choose surroundings security and privacy

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,270
it's literally impossible furthermore

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,100
many of these tools and again I could

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,080
put myself in this thing we built them

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,470
we had a hand in it so we know how they

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,600
work you know we know more than most we

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,800
have to care you know again it's another

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
thing on a list that I have to care

00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,890
about that I didn't have to care about

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,170
before that list keeps getting bigger

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,840
and bigger but this is one of the ones

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:28,290
that I actually kind of agree with

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,990
because I want my stuff secure I want my

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,850
stuff safe I want to choose what

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,830
information is made available to other

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,600
people I don't like the idea that

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,730
Facebook knows more about me than I know

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,280
about me and I don't even use that

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,600
service if you ever want to get really

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,950
creeped out Google Facebook shadow

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,240
profiles that will make you feel good so

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,860
first off we want to say thank you but

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,120
then I want to get into questions

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,950
because I usually get a lot of specific

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,930
questions maybe I won't this time but

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,930
who's got any yes

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,049
[Music]

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,889
they I know true get NAT so the idea

00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:58,049
that we have to keep getting ongoing

00:21:55,889 --> 00:22:00,179
consent that is again this is a totally

00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:03,119
different idea from the u.s. to the EU

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,799
I like their idea better how many of you

00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,450
like because every single time Facebook

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,320
changes something I have to log back in

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,570
and turn it off

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,489
because I don't use it yeah you are not

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,759
allowed to opt in people automatically

00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:20,309
at all for any reason any war you cannot

00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:24,149
check a box for them period - what

00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:25,859
that's the question that that says you

00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:27,479
cannot just say here's a blanket terms

00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,309
of statement that I might change at any

00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:31,440
given point you're just blanket agreeing

00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,080
to see that's what you can't do anymore

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,309
that's you say I want your information

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,469
for X Y & Z and that's so if you add a B

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:43,950
and C you have to go back and get their

00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:46,169
consent again you cannot opt them into

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:53,389
new choices based on what they signed

00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:53,389
previously okay okay

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,750
okay have you changed your terms of

00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,090
service between today and tomorrow

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,170
then you don't have to opt in again see

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,180
the cookies thing is different because

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,880
those get set every single time you go

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,680
and load a browser so that stuff needs

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,480
to get consented every time because

00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,030
you're literally changing the data every

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,070
time and those cookies now theoretically

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,450
contain different information based on

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,460
what you've been searching and going

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,650
cite previously but otherwise yeah you

00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,870
just can't you can't opt-in people for

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:27,330
your stuff anymore now I do want to be

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,720
clear none of this law says you can't

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:33,990
collect it you can still collect all the

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,030
data you want but you have to tell them

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,880
you're doing it you have to ask

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,900
permission just like we I tell my son if

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,800
you want something you have to ask

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,000
permission first

00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:47,100
even if I've let you do it in the past

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,780
same idea you have to do the same thing

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,100
you have to keep asking permission you

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,290
don't have to ask them permission to do

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,720
something they've already agreed to but

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:57,230
you cannot use that previous agreement

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,230
to do something new if that makes sense

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,230
so

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,109
so the idea being is like what and sure

00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:18,759
question was what are your

00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:20,649
responsibilities in terms of collecting

00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,999
data and knowing what you're doing with

00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:23,379
it

00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:25,480
the biggest question when I ask yourself

00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,429
is first off a after you've figured out

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,840
what data is coming into the site what's

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:29,980
being stored because I'm guaranteeing

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,549
there's something sort that you don't

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,249
know about

00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:36,489
I learned that myself too after you get

00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:38,710
past that is do you need it after the

00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:40,720
fact if you're running a little giveaway

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,029
so you know you're collecting a name and

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,580
an email address to give away saying

00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:48,009
give away a book once you've given away

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,269
that book now if you had them going onto

00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:50,529
a mailing list they would have had to do

00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:52,509
all the consent so for a mailing list

00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,759
but otherwise delete that information

00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:56,559
you don't need it anymore like holding

00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,720
on to all this data about people that

00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,830
you're not even using is a privacy issue

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,690
waiting to happen that you could have

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,179
avoided by simply deleting it like one

00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,039
point there was a open source analytics

00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:07,269
plort that I put on my own site that was

00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,139
used to be called Pickwick I think they

00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:10,840
change the name of it

00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:12,429
I forgot I set it up I installed it I

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,340
probably forgot about it it's running

00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,960
for five years until I realize it aired

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,850
out because they finally discontinued

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,409
the thing that I was using and that's

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,419
when I realized like oh wow I have all

00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:23,679
this data so I just deleted it to leave

00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,629
it the tracking script and I deleted the

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,970
entire cell posted platform that data no

00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:29,529
longer existed I now remove the privacy

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,379
issue that could have happened because

00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:34,840
now the data doesn't exist so yes

00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:37,720
there's the you know only keep what you

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:43,210
need and make sure you need it like

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,499
validate why you need it I mean if

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,940
they're doing yeah I mean most of the

00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:47,109
time there's some specific language that

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,119
you'll see in a lot of the forms now

00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:51,970
we'll even add that for you but if

00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,980
you're only putting them in a bucket to

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,559
pick one and then you're deleting the

00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,970
bucket I would again not legal advice I

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,379
would say you're fine now if you're

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,489
adding people to a mailing list you're

00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:02,559
gonna try and market to them later

00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:03,489
that's a whole different story and

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,659
that's something that yeah you would

00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:09,690
need to make sure that you have the

00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:09,690
ongoing consent any other questions

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,970
so so her question was she'd used to

00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,350
plug in that kind of gun like a walk

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,850
through like a wizard saying you know

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,500
pointing out where she may or may not be

00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,910
vulnerable or what she has to do that's

00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,560
a great start honest I did not know that

00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:42,690
existed I'll talk to you afterwards I'd

00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:45,260
like to see that but anyway yeah well

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,310
we'll go late you know later on but um

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,390
you're probably better off than most I'd

00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,230
say that right out right off the bat

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,510
you're probably better off than at least

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,330
80% because most dealers have no idea

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,680
but after that you know you're yeah

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,900
you're running analytics you're running

00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,240
all these things you know if you're

00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,800
aware of it

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,450
that's yeah because yeah you can't

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,160
control what Google does with the data

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,080
that is not your responsibility

00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,660
you have to make sure that people know

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,340
you're giving it to Google that's where

00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,320
your liability comes in for something

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,150
like that it's not that you have to tell

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,280
Google what to do because yeah I don't

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,410
think I can pull that off either but I

00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,840
have to tell people hey I'm letting

00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:23,820
Google know what's going on on my site

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,290
and again most people don't care like

00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,500
we're still waiting to find out if

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,430
people actually care because there's a

00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,630
whole lot of things we're like yeah I

00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,700
care until I actually have to do

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,250
something about it and then my hand goes

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,080
down a little bit more so this could be

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,980
something that only a few people care

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,390
about but governments care about it and

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,700
they have a lot of money and they can

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,110
make people pay and that's really the

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,460
only thing is like I mean I would not

00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,650
wanted you know I don't like dealing

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,360
with anything legal this is another

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,770
thing I'd rather than I deal with for

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,020
information that I could you know four

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,280
things that I can very easily avoid yeah

00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,200
just know what you're doing

00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,510
don't just throw scripts on a site

00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,590
because someone asked marketing asks for

00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:05,610
something that disparage marketing

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:09,590
people but make sure they validate why

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:13,680
they want something whoever they may be

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:16,290
push back a little bit good why just

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,370
just say why you know we need it for the

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,160
Net Promoter Score like I don't even

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,840
know if that means but yeah okay but

00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,049
just make sure that they also understand

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,230
this is the liability we're taking on

00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:30,960
as a company to have this information is

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,980
it really worth it because I think for I

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,360
can only speak for myself but a lot of

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,249
the data that I've collected and tried

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,970
to figure out what to do with it's just

00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:37,830
not good data

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,809
it's scrunt you know it's coming from

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,669
every which way it's not clean it's not

00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:43,320
yeah I can't validate that it's actually

00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:45,600
accurate so I know throwing it away

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,619
anyway so it's like yeah figure out what

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,119
you want figure out what you're trying

00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,470
to decide what you're trying to figure

00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,509
out because then you know what to

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,649
collect again we always just grab stuff

00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:54,450
in the beginning and hope maybe we can

00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,070
piece together when we're done it's

00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,840
gotta be the other way around you know

00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,070
figure out what you need ask for it and

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,779
then just make sure you know you have

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,399
that you know now sites know yeah this

00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,149
is what I'm doing well people keep just

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,220
clicking yes

00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:07,350
always you give them a button that says

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,700
yes people will click yes it doesn't

00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,809
matter what it says in the box so like I

00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,759
don't know what I've told Apple have

00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:13,919
agreed to I have no idea hopefully it's

00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:37,019
something that but is there any other

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:39,989
questions I think a big part of that

00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:43,799
problem is and all use Facebook example

00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:45,809
cuz they're really easy to pick on they

00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,100
have but they have a whole set of data

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,289
about me there's a recent article

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,289
another recent article talking about it

00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:54,809
where the the designer from Google from

00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:56,460
Facebook Reb talked about it as like a

00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:00,299
voodoo doll every bit of information

00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,549
they get about you is adding into this

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,409
little doll so eventually they know what

00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:06,749
you're going to do so they're not

00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:10,590
listening to you on the phone yet you're

00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:12,299
just that predictable and and it's

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,619
creepy to think about it that way the

00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:16,980
voodoo doll really kind of makes it an

00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:18,509
extra level of creepy but I can't

00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,759
request that data to get deleted because

00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:23,279
I didn't give it to them they got it

00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,840
from somebody else so I think a lot of

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,269
the bit like the data that I want gone

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,889
most I have no access to and the you

00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:29,909
still hasn't figured out how basically

00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:32,309
they still haven't fear how to crack

00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:34,649
Facebook yet they're working on it but

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:38,100
they don't know how to get the data

00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:39,660
about you back in your hands because you

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,450
give it to him they collected it on

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:45,600
their own using whatever means they used

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,220
which means maybe you gave them my

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,929
information because you installed

00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,210
Facebook Messenger and it synced your

00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:53,010
contacts so now you have enough Facebook

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,500
has my name picture address and email

00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,700
even though I never gave it to them so

00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,799
now Facebook knows where I've lived

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,690
probably in my entire life they have

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,010
every phone number ever had every email

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,570
address I've ever had because somebody

00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:07,140
had it in their phone and turned on

00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:11,220
Facebook Messenger so I think I think

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,809
what will happen is once that data once

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,230
people realize they can do something

00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,309
with it

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,570
because right now it's like yeah I can

00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,830
go get all that information but I can't

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,270
be the only thing I do is I pull my

00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,320
Amazon stuff because I'm curious how

00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:23,580
much money I'm wasting and but otherwise

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,039
most that information is not relevant to

00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,020
me I don't care but some people do but I

00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,909
think once that information and data

00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,830
actually has some relevant people can do

00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:34,830
something with it they'll start asking

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:41,130
for it a lot more or if there's a big

00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:43,110
thing news breach or somebody you know

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,730
somebody uses information to find

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,190
somebody that you know stalk somebody

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,870
which is a terrible thing now people

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,190
like oh wait what information exists on

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,809
me you know like I think a lot of times

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,240
people will start caring when it starts

00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,220
like hitting home more speak otherwise

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,929
like yeah it's a problem but I gotta

00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,929
take the bread out of the oven so

00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:40,520
zees oh but I beg you I will take yeah

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:41,990
we'll take probably what you're sore

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,549
Simoes like how do you handle taking

00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,380
incoming stuff to do ongoing like trip

00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:47,210
marketing and things like that probably

00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,860
what you're already doing because you're

00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,090
if you're using anything like Constant

00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,830
Contact or MailChimp or any of those

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,870
ones they're putting in unsubscribe

00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,909
links they're taking the information

00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,830
about you know if you unsubscribe be

00:32:55,909 --> 00:33:00,260
like why like I never signed up for this

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:15,110
they they see enough of those they will

00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:16,399
shut down your account usually I'm by

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,779
submitting this I'm agreeing to your

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,059
privacy policy and there's a link to the

00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:22,909
privacy policy that that should be

00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:24,260
sufficient and again it's like if you're

00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:26,210
telling people what you're doing I think

00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,580
the way that you tell them as long as

00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,230
it's not opaque by design is probably

00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,940
gonna be fine like there's not a lot of

00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,470
language about the particulars of how

00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,090
you need to present something to

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,830
somebody it's just that you have to do

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,899
it because that for us that's the big

00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:43,130
hurdle it's not what words to use it's

00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:45,429
to even bother asking and nothing's last

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,429
one here

00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:59,330
mm-hmm well--that's and there she's

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:02,150
asking a lot of websites you go

00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,860
yeah the consent to cookies that was a

00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,660
law first again from the EU that was the

00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,220
but they called the cookie law which was

00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,240
kind of a dumb name but it was that was

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,460
where it started and that's they're

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,840
already expanding on that's why I love

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,130
all the word prep all the word camp

00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,040
sites that you go to had the same thing

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:17,810
because it's built in calm yeah you're

00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,399
basically saying that yeah cookies gonna

00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,649
get said it could be a login cookie it

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,940
could be whatever you can set your

00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:24,260
browser to clear those every time you

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,020
close it you can have them delete over

00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:31,270
30 days like that again you're gonna see

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:33,290
those everywhere but then you come

00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,600
there's probably others probably logins

00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,490
there's probably stuff I wouldn't be

00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,530
surprised if court turns that into a

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:41,090
feature I know that they're just making

00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,620
sure that they build the structural

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,399
stuff for privacy before they build the

00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,990
bells and whistles

00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,310
cuz I've been working on that stuff for

00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,389
core as well so like they've already

00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,130
they've been working the stuff for a

00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,929
couple versions now but I know that

00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:53,379
they're focusing on making sure they

00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:55,280
actually structurally build it right

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:58,400
before they make it pretty

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:05,600
or even visible so

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:07,340
oh yeah there's stuff about you know

00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,890
purging people out and everything else

00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,420
so there's actually ways in there but

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,890
but otherwise yeah again you're gonna

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,960
start seeing a lot more of this stuff

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,670
coming up and it'll be like oh yeah I

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,240
have to agree one other thing just pay

00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:24,320
attention to what you're clicking on

00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:25,700
yeah cool yeah yeah y'all can talk about

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,710
talk about that afterwards Thanks

00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,710
any other questions yeah

00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:39,160
mm-hmm so yeah I apologize I this

00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,750
question was about the privacy by design

00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,670
I apologize I mixed the two leaders the

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,490
impact statement that's what's required

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:48,339
that is the document that has to say who

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,380
has access where the access is where it

00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:51,760
lives what you're gonna do mitigate

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,500
these problems that's the impact

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,720
statement I apologize I got the to the

00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,849
privacy by design is the methodology and

00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:02,109
that's basically approaching something

00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:03,970
by privacy first figuring out what

00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:06,069
you're gonna do to protect users before

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:09,359
you write a single line of code because

00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:12,430
otherwise it's a it's an add-on the best

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,359
probably won't work that well so I think

00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,359
that's it so thank you very much

00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,909
