how's everybody doing today oh good

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,059
start to camp so far awesome how many of

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,160
you are here yesterday for beginner stay

00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:16,770
alright well I hope that we got you

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,210
prepped for the weekend and you can make

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,539
the most of it I'm super happy you're

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,619
here world camp has changed my life in

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,170
many ways

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,689
many of my best friends I have met at

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,150
work camp or we became better friends at

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,489
work camp so I hope that you find at

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,980
least one of your people this weekend

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,620
and you keep those relationships going

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,390
because WordPress is a wonderful

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,370
community and one of the great things

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,780
about WordPress is and I'll say this all

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,510
the time is it's not just a piece of

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,270
software the wit mission of WordPress is

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,340
to democratize publishing because if you

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,530
can't control the voice you can't

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,640
control the message and we in these

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,309
times it's really important that

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,489
everybody's voice is heard and so that

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,340
brings us to content because if you have

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,229
a voice and you have a message you need

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,810
to provide that and publish that in some

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,000
way right how many people here provide

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,260
content or need to provide content on a

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,439
regular basis yeah okay how many people

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:22,439
struggle with content alright so what do

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,369
you think the hardest part about getting

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:32,700
consistent content out anybody

00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:41,189
the time to write the consistent part

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:47,520
okay getting ideas time management yeah

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,520
fear oh that's a good one

00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,170
now do you think it's because you want

00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:00,489
to get that right or because you don't

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:12,129
want anybody else to see it and the

00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:13,599
longer you tweak it right do you think

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,400
having a counter where you can move on

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:30,579
to the next thing right away would be

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:40,769
helpful Christina right it's yes it's it

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:40,769
can be overwhelming yes oh how bad yeah

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,569
Wow yeah so the pacing and how fast it

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,519
is because it's it's not like you're

00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,140
ever going to catch up with content

00:02:49,519 --> 00:03:00,019
because you're going to have a new piece

00:02:51,140 --> 00:03:01,550
coming right out right you know you know

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:09,739
what you're working on well you finally

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:11,450
got it right so my talk is on creating a

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,760
calendar but there's gonna be a little

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,260
window after for me to show you what

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,599
because every room is a little bit

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:22,340
different would it be helpful for me to

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,260
show you how I outsource my content okay

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,180
so y'all remind me that I'm going to

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,950
show you that and I'll just will log

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,310
right into it and I'll show you how I do

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,170
that because it's really one of the

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,090
things I have found so I run an agency I

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,220
love writing and I think I'm a decent

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,970
writer but there's just not enough time

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,280
in the day and what I have found for me

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,519
is most effective is to have a create a

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,500
Content calendar that I can then have a

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,940
Content machine now do I always do it

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,859
perfectly no if you go to my website

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,840
right now I haven't posted anything and

00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:55,190
probably a month that's because I've

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,980
been traveling and being with my family

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,720
right so it's not this is not perfect

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,329
and usually I do talks because I'm

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,810
filling a hole that I need in my own

00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,920
life so don't expect perfection but

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,489
we're going to figure it out together

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,799
okay so let's see I've heard we have

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:18,440
some technical difficulties with this so

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,389
we are going for imperfection right okay

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:27,849
what are the types of content you need

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:29,180
to produce blog posts right social posts

00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:34,550
what else

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:37,250
what's that videos email guides content

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:44,020
upgrades webinars podcasts pop it up it

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:47,200
up it up it up it up right okay so yep

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,200
something like that

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,290
so one of the things we want to have in

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,500
the very beginning of our content plan

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,270
is an idea of what our content how our

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,000
content is going to perform online and

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,540
what's the ideal situation and structure

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,450
for that

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,840
okay so HubSpot did a lot of research

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:11,110
about what's the ideal site structure

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,450
and for for your blog posts and

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,250
presenting your content and they came up

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,060
with this thing called content clusters

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:22,570
or topic clusters and his son looks like

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:27,820
this okay so you want to have your main

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:31,300
ideas one big exhaustive page and a lot

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,850
of little smaller pieces linking back to

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,450
that or less it less important pieces

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,580
right so let's just say you're a web

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:43,330
designer and maybe one of your main

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,760
pages is the exhaustive resource of web

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,980
design why is web design important blah

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,780
blah you know you get the idea but now

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,610
everything that you write that's going

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,280
to be about web design is going to link

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,630
to this page because this is where we

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,460
want to drive all the traffic this is

00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,020
where we want to drive all the authority

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,669
and this is where you're going to put

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:12,669
your greatest SEO efforts right it's to

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:15,250
this one page so yes so that would be

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:17,770
like one what we would call a pillar

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,930
post or a cornerstone content so it

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,060
would be like you're knocking it out of

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,520
the park resource for anybody who wants

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:31,930
to know about that topic does that make

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:34,810
sense okay so what do you do a way and a

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:42,910
cult shop okay so what are the different

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:45,900
the big ideas right so maybe magic

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,900
pebbles right

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,000
okay cool so let's say you're gonna have

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,639
the ultimate guide to magic pebbles and

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,320
you're going to have everything anybody

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,800
could ever want to know about that so

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,440
that when anybody's looking for this

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:10,169
online Google cassette this is the

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:12,660
authoritative resource so that sounds

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:15,780
overwhelming right okay so we're gonna

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,759
reverse engineer it so normally most

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,400
people would start off with this piece

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,010
of content and then build little pieces

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,570
so that seems logical but it's way

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,570
overwhelming and I would never do that

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,000
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,220
break up what the pieces of that pillar

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,740
page would be and we're going to create

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,360
those pieces one at a time and and then

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,750
at the end we're gonna put them all

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,360
together in an authoritative post okay

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,330
because that's so much easier to hand

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,020
off six pieces of content to somebody

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,849
and say can you make this into you know

00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,630
a writer or a graphic designer can you

00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:02,280
redesign this into a pillar page right

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,050
instead of saying can you come up with

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,070
the this and then you're gonna pull

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,330
little things out of it so we're gonna

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:12,360
do it a little bit backwards so it could

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,979
be a list it could be and normally the

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,550
what would be really great way to do

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:19,530
this is to have a lot of different

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,800
pieces of content displayed throughout

00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:26,550
this page so list bullet items quotes

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,580
click to tweets images infographics okay

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,590
so but that sounds really overwhelming

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,060
so don't like shut your brain off right

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,490
now okay because we're gonna backdoor

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:42,409
into that all right so one of the things

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:46,350
for me that makes it easier for me to

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:51,300
make my content on a regular basis is to

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:54,420
have themes okay so I'm in a great group

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,420
called WP elevation and we have content

00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,339
themes okay so every month there's a

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,129
theme and I believe this month is

00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:05,579
profit don't don't hold me on that yeah

00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:08,290
I think it's profit this month right so

00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:10,420
every month that's the whole thing that

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,850
they do is they talk about profit well I

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,309
like to share the content of my friends

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,589
who are in WP elevation and so what I

00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:19,839
want to do is I kind of want to sink my

00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:22,870
themes up with theirs but not be super

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,449
obvious about it and I do this for my

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,819
clients as well so then we can all share

00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:30,639
very similar things but they don't

00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:35,230
they're they don't sound like we're

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:37,720
copying each other so what we do is we

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,910
pair that theme with something that's

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,959
personal or very specific to that

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:49,120
business okay so let's just say what are

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:53,110
you working on personally so for me I

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,360
got a lot of character flaws so I'm

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,240
working on some stuff so this is some of

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,459
the stuff that I'm working on okay

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,439
and so I think when when I did these

00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:03,790
slides of the theme was growth so we'll

00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:05,079
look you'll see on the content calendar

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,319
we have profit but we're going to talk

00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,490
about growth here so what I did is I

00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:12,759
combined those two

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,370
oh it's sprint sorry so with sprint so

00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,370
sprint would been like catching up tying

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,429
up loose ends right okay so at them for

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,309
the month of April our micro themes were

00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:28,449
sprint and emotional management so I

00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:30,879
went back to my my my list of character

00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:32,980
flaws here and I'm like if I were going

00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,290
to pair a sprint up with any one of

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,420
these which one which one would match

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,529
for me and this is this is not something

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,319
you have to do I'm just going to give

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:43,420
you a little window into how I do it so

00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:45,129
I'm like well when I'm burnout I need to

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,230
catch up what's the one thing I need to

00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:49,420
work on I need to work on managing my

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,269
emotions through this so I don't freak

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:56,589
out I don't meltdown so I'm pairing

00:10:52,269 --> 00:11:00,779
those up and so what I came up with for

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:03,519
a theme was the middle miles right so

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:06,459
everybody gets super excited when they

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,769
start their business right and you're

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,170
like on fire I'm going to change the

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,760
world with my business we're gonna I'm

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,240
going to web design the

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,280
of everything right well and and I'm

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,740
like nothing can stop me and then you

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,500
get up and now I'm you're growing you're

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,510
busier what you know and now things

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,020
start to be a grind you still love the

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:31,000
work but it's a lot right maybe it's

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,650
time to build a team maybe it's time to

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,890
outsource maybe it's time to work on

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:38,650
your processes right but this is where

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:41,610
it gets hard and this is where 75% of

00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:45,070
the businesses either fail or give up

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,960
okay what is what's the difference the

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:52,060
difference is your emotional management

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:54,610
and managing your loosens right so how

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:59,020
do we how do we talk about this and how

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:01,750
do we create content around that so I

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,570
like to use content starters because I'm

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,190
lazy and I don't like a blank canvas

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:09,310
right so I need something to react

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:13,120
against or something to prompt me so

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:15,250
let's just say what so this is how we

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,850
use a content starter for our theme what

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:21,780
what are the middle miles why why are

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:26,140
they important why are they so tricky

00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:28,090
right so you can see immediately you can

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,430
start thinking your brain starts moving

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,110
it a little bit okay it's just a jump

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,660
start now this is not going to write

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,660
your content for you but it will give

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,340
you a way to get started which for most

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,800
of us that's our biggest problem it's

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:47,350
just getting started how to how do you

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,950
survive the middle miles then how to is

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:53,080
a great for an infographic or a piece of

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:59,110
content that's just steps or showing you

00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:01,360
how to do something engage your

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,460
community okay

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,350
this is something that SiteGround does

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,200
really well on a site ground community

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,790
ambassador site ground partners where

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,880
they're ambassadors to create content

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,590
who's in your community that can help

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,840
you that you reach out to you that you

00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,470
guys can do content together maybe it's

00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,570
a guest post maybe you're quoting them

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,300
how do you let's just say maybe we do it

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,720
a podcast and the topic is how do you

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,910
man

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,120
the emotional drain that follows the

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,279
startup years I'm sure that you could

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:39,339
there be at least 15 people in this room

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:43,300
that could talk about that a personal

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:45,639
rant or an opposite view hey maybe the

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,649
sitting for you maybe it's time to give

00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,470
up maybe you're doing the thing that's

00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,939
not your passion and maybe it's time to

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,819
throw in the towel and do what you were

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:57,519
really meant to do okay so these

00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:59,410
provocative posts are really great for

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,490
like email newsletters social media

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:05,019
posts right because what you want is to

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:13,449
kind of like shock somebody into

00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:17,589
reaction listicle or roundup so this is

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:19,569
great for Facebook teasers or a really a

00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,550
blog post where you really want to just

00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:24,360
share some love with your community

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,829
reach out to them so I did this on

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,990
productivity tips and I reached out to

00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:30,759
my community WP elevation and I said

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,259
what's your greatest productivity tip

00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,420
and I got a bunch of them and then I

00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:35,889
created nice little graphics put them up

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,750
in a blog post and shared them out on

00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:39,309
social media everybody loved it

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,870
everybody enjoys looking at their own

00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,029
face and hearing their own words and

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,040
being included and feeling like they're

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:46,990
a part of something and guess what they

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:53,290
share those things and now you're

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:56,079
creating a lot of activity now you've

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,300
got all these pieces of content that you

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,500
just did about this and we're gonna

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,569
we're going to go through this a little

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,959
bit slower back back up so don't worry

00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:07,899
so now you take all of these pieces of

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,110
content and now you've got a bunch of

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:13,059
content about the same topic

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,430
now you hand this off to your writer or

00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:17,980
you hand or you sit down for an

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,620
afternoon and create an ultimate post

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,360
with all of these pieces you just put

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,089
together because now you've got a list

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,029
now you've got an infographic now you've

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:32,009
got the what the why the how the who can

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,009
help why it will help right

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,080
and it all starts with your content

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,080
starters

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,690
okay and you can do this over and over

00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,810
and over and over again right every

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:50,240
single month just start back over again

00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:55,140
right is it perfect no will it work yeah

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,630
right so the idea is for you to make

00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,680
this your own so what what would this

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,980
look like to you

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,130
so if you do you have a podcast do you

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,930
have a webinar would you like one right

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,630
you and you can start seeing the

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,779
possibilities where now it becomes like

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:15,000
not oh man I've got to create content

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:18,060
but like oh where could I what could I

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,300
do right so we want to take it away from

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:24,209
being a chore and start looking at the

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,620
possibilities of being able to connect

00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:31,380
with your community so we're about I'm

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,380
not done but I want to show you this

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,510
link so this is going to be a link to

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,180
the page on my website where we have I

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:42,930
have a spreadsheet where I have created

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,190
a Content calendar for you okay and

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,480
we're going to look at what that looks

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,240
like but I want you to go ahead and take

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,839
a picture of that if you wanted because

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,000
what I want for you is for you to leave

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,709
here with all the tools to have your

00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,390
content planned out for the next 12

00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:04,199
months okay does anybody want to

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:09,959

interactive all right so here we go and

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:36,480
let me see if I can increase this thing

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,230
oh it's not gonna do that anybody know

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,910
how to do this

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,600
I'm technologically illiterate with

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:48,480
Google sheets not here white ctrl+ maybe

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:51,990
oh here we go okay there we go can you

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,520
see that okay so let's say and I'm just

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,610
going to walk through this just so we

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,370
can see what we're doing here so we're

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,910
gonna have the theme we're gonna have

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,490
all of our weeks here right so of the

00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,740
weeks of the month the content type

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,990
right so how many different content

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:14,420
pieces do you have how where you want to

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:17,220
put them the content starters and then

00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:21,170
we're gonna talk about what else we can

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,130
do with this okay so let's yeah

00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,510
absolutely

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:31,590
okay so let's do let's do June for you

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:35,490
okay so June okay so what what business

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:37,590
are you in MailChimp expert okay so

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,290
would you be creating content for

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:45,809
yourself or do you work for MailChimp

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:47,940
are you independent okay okay so when

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,230
you're creating content how many

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,370
different topics do you always talk

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,050
about MailChimp or do you talk about

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:59,429
productivity do you talk about

00:18:52,050 --> 00:19:02,910
automations okay alright and so what

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,620
does that do for the client so it's not

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,140
just that they're saving time but what's

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:15,510
the end goal that that that they want to

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:17,550
achieve okay okay so what they're

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:32,520
wanting to do is reach their community

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:36,450
through okay to reach what goal okay and

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,470
what does that do for them build their

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,120
business yes

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:45,809
okay increase their profitability right

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,470
give them more time okay the reason I'm

00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:50,220
saying that

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,659
because right we'll see that most of us

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,600
don't but that's what makes really

00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:56,669
compelling content right so I'm not

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,080
going to like if I need to know how to

00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,029
do something I'm going to come to your

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,950
website but I'm not going to come back

00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:03,720
until the next time I need to know how

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:15,809
to do something unless there's a

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:16,379
compelling reason no that's okay that's

00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:18,539
okay

00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:21,929
my sign calls me dude so he's like dude

00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:24,090
I got a good play no it's true it's true

00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,529
so yes that's and that's the missing

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,860
piece and a lot of people's content

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:30,870
right is that yes we want to give them

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,440
the how to's but we also need to give

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:37,889
them a why to come back okay all right

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,139
so let's say so let's say it's time

00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:43,129
management so this gives you so much

00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:45,149
more to talk about than just email

00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:49,440
marketing and automation and all of that

00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:59,929
okay so let's talk about let's make our

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:59,929
theme for June time management okay okay

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,389
so and one of the great things about

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:09,899
teaching is you can always teach on the

00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:13,169
thing you need to learn huh so me

00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:14,250
content calendar is my weakest link so I

00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,509
need to crush it

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,700
so that's what I'm going to do is figure

00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:20,250
out how to teach you so I'm reminding

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,519
myself by hearing myself out loud okay

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:26,789
so now what is it what is time

00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,809
management and why is it important okay

00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,809
so we're going to put that down

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:40,290
well let's just say what is time

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:43,870
management and popular techniques right

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:46,240
okay now so we've got the why so now

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:49,150
this is your topic for your blog post

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,160
and now you've got to start you know

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,040
what you're going to write about and and

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,450
really just start googling stuff right

00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,950
and start making notes now you've got

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,600
your thing okay so now we're going to do

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:12,400
why is it important and why do you need

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:16,150
it all right ask a question or how email

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,950
marketing or how automation can help you

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,420
in some matters so we're gonna get to

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,810
that but here's one of the things we

00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,920
want to do we don't even want to push

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,550
MailChimp in this article because we

00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,610
want something that's very universal

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:33,160
everybody can use this because you don't

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,400
want to just pull in nobody's going to

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,600
share to their entire social network

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,600
well very few people are going to share

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:56,470
okay okay so here's here's the reason

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,900
why we want it Universal okay so if

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,540
you're talking about a how-to and have

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,850
like time management and how how its

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,830
effective using mail chance right you're

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,470
gonna capture people who are already

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,850
looking for that what you also want to

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,980
capture are people who hadn't even

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:15,640
thought of that

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,820
okay and those people they're gonna it's

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,010
gonna be universal and so the person

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,440
it's being found already don't stay with

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:26,650
me alright so because what's going to

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,720
happen is the teacher is going to share

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,310
it to their plumber friend and the

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,380
plumber is going to share it to another

00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,960
person because everybody needs time

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,630
management an event and it's going to

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,950
land in somebody's lap who's like I have

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:43,890
been looking for a solution I didn't

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,890
even know this was it okay so

00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,330
okay

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,930
so obviously we're gonna spice this up a

00:23:52,330 --> 00:24:02,530
little bit but that's your starter now

00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:14,020
how to okay how to use MailChimp to be

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:20,560
more effective with your time okay okay

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:23,200
now dude it's so easy okay so now we're

00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,810
gonna go whoo not how all right so what

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,850
whoo not how is is one of the things

00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,800
that as you get busier in business you

00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,450
can't do everything yourself right so

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,490
you need to outsource that you need to

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,550
find another person or find somebody

00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,380
else who has already solved this problem

00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:40,390
you want to be the solution to that so

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,420
you want to show your clients your

00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:46,030
visitors your word your website users

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,780
that you are there who and they don't

00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:53,740
have to do the howl right so maybe maybe

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,600
you are a fancy consultant and instead

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,290
of them having to stop what they're best

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,890
at they can just hire you to do that

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:06,700
right and if you don't yeah and so you

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:10,630
can say how can an automation expert

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,930
help save you time and increase your BAM

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,930
okay

00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:29,159
mm-hmm okay Oh God

00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:33,870
see how this is not that hard right it's

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:39,330
really fun trying to do that you think

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:40,980
so yes okay so here's what you can do

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,320
and and maybe you could pair up with

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,389
somebody who also struggles with less

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,169
linear thinking and just have them ask

00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:51,360
to you ask you these questions you don't

00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:54,059
think so do you think this is abstract

00:25:51,360 --> 00:26:00,029
see to me this is like what what why why

00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:07,649
how to you how to exactly taking this

00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:10,110
chunk of milk I've been showing you do

00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:14,090
you have any creative like abstract

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:20,610
friends that also struggle with content

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:22,440
you'll be able to do it okay well that's

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:25,649
what we want to do we just want to open

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,679
the door so that everybody can has a way

00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:32,700
to create great content in a really

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:37,169
structured way a to B B to C right okay

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,269
so personal rant so maybe who here has

00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:41,460
ever ranted online about anything

00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:44,610
you're lying the ones of you who have

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,929
not raised your hands okay so what we

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:50,460
want to do is we want to do something

00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:52,049
provocative okay so when is when she

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,809
when should time management go out the

00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:55,409
window when is email automation not the

00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:01,610
right answer

00:26:55,409 --> 00:27:01,610
when is the person there you go

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:16,410
they'll recommend it to somebody who it

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,410
you know what I read this blog post

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,860
exactly and it makes you seem more

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,010
authentic even if you're not but like

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,170
when because you've all been in a sales

00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,000
situation with someone who's like this

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,530
is the answer to your problem I don't

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,050
know what the problem is but this is the

00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,660
answer and you don't believe them

00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:40,690
because you know every service doesn't

00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,630
fit everybody right so this gives you

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:46,860
your pushing them back but also what

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,860
happens when you push people away

00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,930
they're more they're more attractive

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:56,440
playing hard-to-get as effective for a

00:27:52,930 --> 00:28:01,390
reason okay does anybody have a webinar

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,010
or a podcast okay

00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,740
so here's where you can engage your

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:11,410
community do you know somebody who is

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:13,720
just killing it it could be either one

00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:16,900
so this is just this is where you engage

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,810
your community so it could be a podcast

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,720
it could be a webinar it could be just a

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:24,340
print interview right it could be

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,070
anything how do you engage your

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,990
community to get their input right so

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,550
you're kind of like hijacking them for

00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:41,280
your content right

00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:41,280
okay so absolutely

00:28:46,940 --> 00:29:07,290
okay right correct but you want to push

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,120
it away from yourself and focus it on

00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,980
them because then they're gonna feel

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,840
comfortable to really go into their

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,750
story and that's where you get really

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,060
great content right so maybe you're

00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,660
interviewing somebody and you're like

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,840
okay

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,710
tell me about what automation has

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,200
changed your life

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,360
what are you able to do now that you

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,060
weren't able to do before right so my

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,700
social media automation has freed me up

00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,990
so I can spend more time with my kids

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,130
okay that's pretty big

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:40,320
right so I'm sure someone who is

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,740
struggling with putting out manual

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,440
newsletters or following up or all the

00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,360
things that MailChimp can do for them so

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,400
it's not like helping them with their

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,860
email what's the end benefit that they

00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,480
get and what's that story because that's

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,210
the story that's going to be interesting

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,620
to people right and maybe they're

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,730
interested in the story and not the

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,990
automation but you see what I'm saying

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:23,550
because we don't want to be salesy all

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:24,900
the time absolutely so maybe this is

00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:27,720
you're on somebody else's webinar a

00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,980
podcast and maybe maybe that was a

00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,860
couple of months ago and now you're

00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:34,170
going to put up the show notes and

00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,820
really go into a deep dive about other

00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,360
things that you talked about that so

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,730
this is not a prison this should not

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,650
cage you in this should set you free

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:45,360
okay so make this your own and if you

00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,150
don't want to interview people and you

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,130
you're someone who gets interviewed just

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,840
flip the script on that and and just

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:56,010
take that and say how can I turn that

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,850
into more content for myself okay so now

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:04,920
we've got another blog post

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:06,390
yeah no it's however you want to engage

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,610
your community not everybody does

00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:13,080
webinars not everybody does Facebook

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:16,860
lives not everybody does podcasts and

00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,690
that's fine however you can take this

00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,420
and make it your own the idea is to

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,780
create compelling content that's going

00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,060
to add value and ultimately lead to more

00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,520
conversions for you to create yourself

00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,230
as an authority as someone who cares

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,850
about people and not just about sales

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:38,160
right okay so a listicle or a roundup

00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:41,550
this is what I was talking about as far

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,100
as doing like what are your productivity

00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:47,040
tips right so you can take that and make

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:50,730
that a really nice thing and it's so

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:54,300
easy put out on Twitter like how has

00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:56,190
MailChimp saved you time or like what

00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,720
what are five things you get to do

00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,970
because you're not stuck doing email

00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,240
boom buh buh buh but it's such an easy

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:04,980
ask from people you know and then you

00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,020
just make some nice little graphics with

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,150
their pay whether with their face and

00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,220
their quote on it everybody loves that

00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,730
and it's super easy what would that take

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:18,150
you thirty minutes not even probably

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:23,040
alright well maybe not the first time

00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:26,970
but the fourth time like ten minutes ten

00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:33,750
minutes and now you've got a yeah it

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:35,850
doesn't have to be fancy well and that's

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:38,010
something that when you don't put out a

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,810
lot of content and I don't know how much

00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,520
content you put out but if you don't put

00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,290
out a look if you don't put out a lot

00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,960
every time you do it it's like doing it

00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:49,400
for the first time but if you're doing

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:55,160
this spoon but boom but um it it makes

00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,160
yeah okay

00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:12,920
[Music]

00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:15,260
hey you can I would say I would just I

00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,840
would privatize them and say hey I'm

00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,540
thinking about you suck do you mind and

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,910
I'll let you know yeah and you say I'll

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,400
let you know when it's live and now

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:27,170
you've been gate the point is to like

00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,500
bring your network to life a little

00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:34,640
right and and also save time because I'm

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:38,420
lazy okay now we're going to take all of

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:44,090
this so we're going to lose put top tips

00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:46,580
blah blah blah right other people's

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:49,910
posts you'll remember OPP this is not

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,760
the same thing okay all right and then

00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:55,520
we're going to take all of this and

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,190
you're going to do now you have a big

00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,630
chunk of content that either you can sit

00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,180
down with or you can hand off to a

00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:04,730
writer and say I want the ultimate guide

00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:09,610
of how MailChimp can help you save time

00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:13,850
and give you give you more freedom right

00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:15,290
that's pretty cool right now so we want

00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,030
to talk about - what are we going to

00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,010
what's this content going to do for us

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,620
we've talked about how we are going to

00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:24,340
help other people with our content so

00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,840
now we're gonna want a call to action

00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,310
each piece of content needs a call to

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,040
action we want to put our content to

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:35,480
work sometimes elegantly and sometimes

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,490
with a hammer right okay so here's some

00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,399
different types of calls to action and

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:43,280
you only want to be salesy like maybe

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,620
one time out of every four or five right

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,760
so so value value value value value

00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:56,560
hammer right so I like to have email

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,560
signups what's that yeah I mean

00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:03,759
yeah and different platforms maybe

00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:06,390
mm-hmm see I'm hijacking her content

00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:11,049
right now see she's doing my job for me

00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:13,150
see um so we've got email signups right

00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:14,349
so at the bottom and that's a very you

00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,329
know you can just have that people are

00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:18,309
so used to seeing that but you can have

00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:23,049
an email sign up on every page that's

00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:26,289
kind of a given you can she can look you

00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:28,599
see how this is working you can have on

00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:31,809
your social media drive them a call to

00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,880
action to get them onto your blog call

00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:35,259
now book an appointment but you don't

00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,420
want to have the same call to action all

00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:38,710
the time I mean maybe you do maybe you

00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,809
want everybody to call you all the time

00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:43,869
it's up to you this is just how I did

00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:45,489
okay and then maybe what you really want

00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:48,519
people to do especially on your engage

00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:50,259
one is to comment or engage so here's

00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:53,049
just a bunch of different join your

00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:55,809
Facebook group you know join your email

00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:58,089
list but make sure you have a plan and

00:35:55,809 --> 00:36:00,910
where you want people to go I know I've

00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:03,130
been guilty of creating really great

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:07,359
content and then not telling anybody

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,950
what to do with it and it's better than

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,680
not doing content at all but it's

00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:14,319
definitely a lost opportunity so having

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,970
this right on your calendar this is what

00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:23,499
I'm gonna do right and then we can do I

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:24,789
like to have on here also where am I

00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:27,069
going to link this internally where's

00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:30,039
that page right that so we're going to

00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:31,900
create the pillar post we're going to

00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:35,079
put that up and then we're gonna go back

00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:37,989
through at a later date and link to it

00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,670
and the infographic that we made right

00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:41,980
so maybe we'll make an infographic on a

00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,259
how-to now that can be a Content upgrade

00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,660
for every single page that you just done

00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:49,329
so let's just say you've got a you've

00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,660
got a down week who I don't ever have

00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:54,970
down weeks but let's just say you have a

00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,619
down minute so you can go back and even

00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,289
freshen up this content with your

00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:01,390
content upgrades greater you know better

00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:02,829
linking structure so there's just so

00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,420
much so you can just keep going and

00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:06,160
going and layering depending on how much

00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,599
time if you don't have any time should

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,640
get the content the call to actions up

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,119
there and let's just move on right

00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:16,150
I love my people my friends in the

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,670
WordPress community and so I want I'm

00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:21,130
creating a goal this year to have my

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:26,289
relationship building as part of my

00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:29,289
content plan okay so see if Jill's right

00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:31,900
so here's what I want to do I want to

00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:34,089
know who in my network do I want to give

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:39,430
support to who do I want to bring closer

00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:41,529
in to me all right I know right so quote

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,930
so here's something I hear some ways I

00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:48,400
can do that I can quote a strategic

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:50,739
partner site one of their resources and

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,940
then on my super salesy week I just skip

00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:54,430
that way because that's all about me

00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:57,009
right but then I have what it's called

00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,359
son reach moon landing so maybe it's

00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:59,499
somebody outside of my network or

00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,059
somebody I've met just once and they're

00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:03,249
super fancy and I don't think I deserve

00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:04,989
them but I'm gonna go for it right I'm

00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:06,940
gonna shoot for the Sun but then I'm

00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:08,410
gonna probably land on the moon so we're

00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,999
gonna we're gonna reach out to them and

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,009
maybe maybe we'll reach out to them

00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:13,960
maybe we'll just cite their book you

00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:16,180
know mek amend something all right and

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,210
then you know for when you're engaging

00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:22,329
guest speaker quit participant so it's

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:26,579
all just about being intentional with a

00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:31,980
spreadsheet right okay

00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:31,980
and now you

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:42,230
okay so that's what time is it right now

00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:49,710
11:40 okay so that took us about 20

00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,960
minutes 15 20 long we've been standing

00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,690
up here but if I wasn't talking to

00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:05,280
somebody how long would that take me

00:38:53,690 --> 00:39:11,430
five minutes 10 minutes yes that's block

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:13,830
all the different types of content so

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:16,619
this is this is just a schedule and I

00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:18,780
literally just picked some weeks right

00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:21,869
so I made a list of all the different

00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,720
types of content I might put out in a

00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:27,590
week right so let's say week one it's a

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,730
blog post in a social media long-form

00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,660
maybe it's just a blog post let's be

00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,119
honest I'm probably not gonna do the

00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,600
social media long-form but this is an

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,880
ideal even if you only did two things

00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:42,330
this month it's more than I probably did

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,550
this month anyway right so week one of

00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,109
the month I'm gonna do for June we're

00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:49,650
gonna do a blog post in a long-form

00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:52,020
social media week to a blog post week

00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,520
three a blog or the blog post and an

00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,970
infographic would be week two week three

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,200
blog post and email blasts week for your

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,210
community engagement in a blog post

00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:04,040
whatever this looks like for your type

00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,040
of content yes

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:16,890
mm-hmm so I'll be completely honest I

00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:18,869
struggle with that okay and I even have

00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,510
somebody I outsource this to and I

00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:23,819
struggle getting it to them okay

00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,130
completely honest this is not I don't

00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:28,079
perfectly execute this what is your

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:30,240
production look like I would love this

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,270
would be a goal for me to have the next

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,980
quarter planned out how long would that

00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,750
take me probably longer it took me to

00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,930
fix my slides for this thing but I still

00:40:36,750 --> 00:41:09,540
haven't done it so you you do this on my

00:40:39,930 --> 00:41:11,430
behalf that process usually takes a

00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,380
couple of hours to really like get

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:21,720
through what are the right images homing

00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:24,750
through like what do we want to use so

00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,579
you can I would love to invite you to my

00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,839
meetups you display how you do that and

00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,290
then we record it and everybody can

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:48,809
watch it happen i hijacking another

00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:51,270
person's content okay yes throw this

00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:52,330
window for a week and say you know

00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:59,050
something

00:41:52,330 --> 00:42:03,100
I think this is a great fallback for

00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:04,960
when the spirit does not move if the

00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,910
spirit is moving all the time you don't

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,640
need a Content plan or you want to be a

00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,580
little bit more strategic about it right

00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,740
so for me if I if if I'm just like on

00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,420
fire for something I'm just gonna I'm

00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,280
just gonna start writing I'm just gonna

00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,650
write whatever I want I'm not going to

00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,990
care about the call to action because

00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,180
passionate writing is so much more

00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:28,210
effective right but I don't know about

00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,720
you the spirits not always moving and so

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:34,180
that's what the content calendar is for

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,270
okay well thank you so much I really

00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:41,320
appreciate let's give up let's give it a

00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:43,000
me round of applause thank you and Amy

00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,830
we're gonna have this there's a link

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,930
here and you'll see this on on the last

00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:53,530
page here let's see if I can get

00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:55,750
well it's s5d dot me forward slash

00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:59,980
calendar let's get all the way back so

00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:04,060
you can see it dududududu there we go

00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:05,590
all right so we've got a few minutes do

00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,910
you guys want to ask questions or you

00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:12,900
want me to show you how I outsource this

00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,900
outsourced ok yes question

00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:23,530
so this is a great case study for

00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,420
relationship building are there people

00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,460
in your network who have great content

00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,230
and they have like a great resource and

00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,390
you're talking about it just link to

00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,220
their resource

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:36,640
yeah just link to it you know just say

00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:39,970
and my friend Melanie has a great talk

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,150
on doing proposals and link to her video

00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:45,580
right or link to her talk

00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:49,300
so you it's not always you wanted to

00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:50,860
give out because Google does reward when

00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,030
you're providing more value and your

00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,880
content so that's something to think

00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:59,620
about okay real quick let's see if I can

00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,250
log on here and I'll just show you where

00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,500
is it

00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,110
oh it says the Woodstock WordPress

00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,150
meetup and you just got on go on meetup

00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,560
search WordPress and it's Woodstock and

00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,420
we're on the first and third Wednesdays

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:16,060
so we're running really close some time

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:21,940
let me see if I can pull this off is it

00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:24,010
not okay oh okay well let's I just did

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:28,930
that shortener right before like five

00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:31,770
minutes before this so let's see we'll

00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,770
do the long one then

00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:44,690
there we go so go to sugar five

00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:50,210
design.com forward slash content -

00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:51,470
calendar - download and if that's not if

00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,060
that's not working because literally I

00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,440
did this five minutes before because I

00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:59,750
was like this talk isn't good enough so

00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:04,400
let's do this it is sugar five fi ve

00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:08,300
design.com forward slash content -

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,400
calendar - download ok it's just a

00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,290
Google sheet or you can go to the link

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,520
here like so we'll have the download

00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,780
right there and if that's not working I

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,020
gave you the x1 cuz I wasn't sure what I

00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:23,869
was doing okay so let's go really quick

00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:26,480
oh no I'm running out of time so there's

00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:30,619
my content plan so this is kind of an

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:33,800
older content plan but let's say here's

00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:36,319
my theme my theme is the art of art of

00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,460
finishing good project management okay

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:46,220
you can see can you see my can't see the

00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:48,500
content starter right alright so what I

00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:51,619
do is I take one of these take these

00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:55,490
topic take the title and then I put it

00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:57,290
into what I temple it and I if I'm not

00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:00,230
gonna write it myself then I can order

00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:02,210
it I like using text broker and I what I

00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,880
say it's like 10 bucks to get a blog

00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,160
post that's not the blog post I'm gonna

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,319
use nine times out of ten it's gonna

00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,760
give me a good first draft to react

00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:12,650
against because when I'm really busy

00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,630
starting with a blank page is really

00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,290
hard but if I get something back and I'm

00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:17,180
like what

00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,270
and I like start going up that's so much

00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:23,150
easier for me it's called text broker

00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:25,099
dot-com okay one of the things and this

00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,020
is probably the best thing that I can

00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:29,900
show you this will save you super amount

00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:32,990
of time and then we'll we'll be done

00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:36,490
here it is how to order how to order a

00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:40,060
brief or how to create craft your brief

00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,060
okay can you see that

00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:49,020
now okay so I started by work I started

00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,320
writing for text broker years and years

00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:58,110
and years ago oh wait hold on

00:46:51,320 --> 00:47:00,270
it's going away oh it's not working okay

00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:03,060
so what I found is you get much better

00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:05,760
content if you give them very succinct

00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,800
and let them be creative because the

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,900
professionals who write and they do this

00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,300
all day long they write like 10 12 15

00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,880
articles a day they want to grab it they

00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,070
want to go right but I've seen a lot of

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,290
people put like these essays they could

00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,790
have written the whole blogpost the time

00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:22,110
they gave their directions nobody's

00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,700
going to write that normally the newbies

00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:25,860
are gonna pick that up so you want the

00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,560
professionals so I set the deadline for

00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:31,020
one day because newbies won't pick that

00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,150
up right only the professionals are

00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:36,210
willing to jump on something and turn it

00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:39,390
around in one day so we want to say very

00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:40,770
very quick quickly please do not pick

00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,250
this up if you can't deliver this by

00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,590

00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:47,850
put tomorrow's date on here I need a

00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:51,600
short article on the title like what is

00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:55,830
time management this is for who's your

00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,420
audience okay and who and so this is for

00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,840
me I'm a digital marketing

00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,520

00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,290
businesses right speaking to their

00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,990

you want to have and then the rest of us

00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,970
just keep the tone upbeat in positive

00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,200
use bullet points and it's gonna be for

00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,470
full write so I can publish it under my

00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,170

you'll get this back within 24 hours now

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,380
if you've got your content calendar out

00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:30,780
for the whole quarter done right and

00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,760
you've got enough money in your text

00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:37,280
broker account you could literally order

00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:40,320
all of your content for the next quarter

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,340
right and now maybe you don't knit so

00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,930
now you've got it all and sometimes

00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,760
you're gonna get a turd I'll be honest

00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:47,000
with you sometimes you're gonna get a

00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,000
turd

00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,180
sometimes literally I'm just proofing it

00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,280
and I'm done and I've gotten some gems

00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:59,880
like that most of the time I'm spending

00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,890
about 30 minutes going in rearrange it

00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,880
and some of them are just duds

00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:07,350
but okay so I lost $12 you know this is

00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,540
not going to replace a really good

00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:12,690
content writer what this is is to give

00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:16,050
you a first draft or to give your VA a

00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:18,600
first draft to for them to now go in or

00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:20,250
you to go in and say okay let me say

00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,230
what I really feel because what I

00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,150
couldn't do is is really start outlining

00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,250
it myself just that's what I use this

00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:28,440
for it's like a first step and outline

00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,700
go in here and you go oh well this

00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,350
person clearly didn't know what they're

00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:36,320
talking about because they said that and

00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:36,320
I would never say that yeah go ahead

00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:55,470
mm-hmm verbally oh oh nice mm-hmm no no

00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,390
no and that's totally great I like to

00:49:55,470 --> 00:50:00,300
have a little bit of my voice on

00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:01,680
something but at some point I'm getting

00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:05,330
to the point where I don't want that and

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,330
I'm gonna hand it completely off yes

00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:13,530
