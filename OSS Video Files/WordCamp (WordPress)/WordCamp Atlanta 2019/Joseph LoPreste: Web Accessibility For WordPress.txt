Title: Joseph LoPreste: Web Accessibility For WordPress
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	We explain what web accessibility (WCAG 2.1) is and why it is so important we understand it and be compliant.
Then we offer our easy and actionable steps that you can take and incorporate into your design and development process.
We also explain each step so you know exactly what they are and how to implement them.
Finally we offer some links to completely free software that will help you test and remediate your website.

well I appreciate you guys coming out

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,520
this early in the morning they always

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,510
give me the early talk I think they do

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,980
that on purpose my name is Joe Lopresti

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,030
like you said I'm from st. Pete design

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,490
we're a web development company and we

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,449
basically we're based out of st. Pete

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:25,410
and we do custom software and

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,330
accessibility all right what we do is we

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,929
audit remediate WordPress websites for

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,160
accessibility issues we teach

00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,380
corporations and IT teams how to be

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,180
compliant stay compliant we give

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,270
WordPress accessibility talks and we

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,870
build custom software or at our story a

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,820
couple years ago we got a job from a

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,860
government agency about accessibility we

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,449
knew nothing about it but like any good

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:55,079
developer we took the job and then that

00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:56,850
proceeded our research fair research

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,649
face started after that and part of that

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,359
was we came across the National

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:06,360
Federation of the blind it's actually

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:09,210
the largest gathering of blind people in

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,799
the world really convention so that was

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,299
a big deal that wasn't Orlando so that

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,310
was only about an hour drive so I was

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,580
right in my backyard and going through

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,750
that was when we realized how many

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,970
disabled individuals there were really

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,780
never really thought about it and how

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,360
difficult it was for them to to navigate

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,070
technology and stuff it was a big deal

00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,720
and once we got out of that we we

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,670
continue our research phase and just

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,820
found it very difficult to find any

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,860
information about accessibility it was

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,119
it was pretty hard that's when we

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,509
decided we need to put it all together

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,610
and get the word out so that's how this

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,030
talk came about web accessibility made

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,350
easy for WordPress okay and this talk

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,420
I'm going to give you guys some facts

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,020
and I'm gonna explain what section 5 it

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,119
508 is I'm gonna offer you our 11 easy

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,100
steps for to help you with your section

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,840
508 compliance and at the end I'm gonna

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,490
give you some free developer tools that

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,740
will help you alright a few facts over 1

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,440
billion people worldwide have some sort

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,870
of disability that's a big number and of

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,940
that an estimated 253 million people

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,500
have a vision impairment and that's kind

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,780
of what we focus on when it comes to

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,640
accessibility because we think that's

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,470
the the group that has the biggest

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,620
hurdles for Internet

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,200
they all have hurdles but we believe we

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,610
can reach and help the most people with

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,590
that group and of that 253 million 19

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,870
million of those vision impaired people

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,170
are children and I have two kids

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,190
watching them interact with technology

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,620
they're just pretty much one and the

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,959
same at this point they're like little

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:53,530
cyborgs and I can just only imagine 19

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:57,579
million all right there were 814 section

00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:02,980
508 lawsuits in 2017 there was over

00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:05,200
2,200 lawsuits last year all 2,200

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:09,129
lawsuits were filed by less than 50

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,590
plaintiffs and the little kind of

00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,480
catch-22 here is I'm gonna show you how

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,329
to be section 508 compliant and that's

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,239
the law but the lawsuits are happening

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:23,260
under title 3 of the ADA a not section

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,329
508 which is title 3 states that an

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,700
individual's got to have the same access

00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:30,220
to everything that everybody does that's

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,470
where like blue parking spaces and

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,900
bathrooms large bathrooms things like

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,599
that came about this is just basically

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,790
title 3 for the internet it's a little

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,000
graph right here you can you can see the

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:49,629
exponential growth in lawsuits 2015

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,290
there was 57 2016 there was 262 2017 814

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:55,329
last year 2200 and you can imagine what

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,889
2019 is gonna be see I'm gonna have to

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:02,199
redo my graph here and most of the

00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,120
lawsuits are coming from New York and

00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:07,720
Florida new you out of the 2200 I think

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,209
New York had 1500 think Florida had 5 or

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,049
600 and basically the rest of America

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:17,859
split the last hundred or two all right

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,349
what is section 508 and wake egg wake

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:22,830
egg the web content accessibility

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:25,590
guidelines is basically the worldwide

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,400
criteria that they put together for

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,870
websites

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,590
they break it down into three different

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,600
levels a double-a and triple-a basically

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,389
section 508 says you have to be a and

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,130
double-a compliant of Wake AG triple-a

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,800
compliant is very difficult if not

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,919
impossible in some some scenarios to

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,060
obtain okay section five away this is

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,470
the one we're worried about this is

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,419
pretty much a dump down version of wake

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,100
a this is the American version again

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,860
wake AG is three levels a double-a

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,510
triple-a section 508 the American

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,090
version says that we have to be

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:05,650
compliant to level a and double-a of

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:09,479
Wake AG and the section 508 is just a

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,550
part of the America's Disability Act

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:15,160
all right well way CAG breaks down into

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,810
four main ideas we got perceivable with

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,180
deals with things like text alternative

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,320
media make sure things are

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,600
distinguishable then you got operable

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,180
gotta make sure your entire sites

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,889
accessible by only a keyboard you got to

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,990
make sure yet enough time you have to

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:35,410
think of things like seizures and make

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,460
sure your sites navigable understandable

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,780
you got to make sure your site's

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,979
readable gonna make sure it's

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,450
predictable and you got to make sure

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:46,150
assistive technologies and stuff work

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,950
and understand your site its robust to

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,650
make sure it's compatible with different

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,419
pieces of assistive technology and into

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,340
the future don't just think of now think

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,199
of where this technology is gonna be a

00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,510
few years down the road so your site

00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:07,919
works okay why does section 508 it

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:10,389
exists this is why because this is what

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,460
two hundred fifty three million people

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,830
see when they go to your website they

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,800
don't see nothing we can fight all day

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,900
long with the client client wants us to

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,490
make this special font they want all

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,910
these amazing colors and all these

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,710
things it's all irrelevant to an

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,060
individual who's disabled and especially

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,800
the two hundred fifty three million

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,150
people who are who are a low vision

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,430
because this is what they see all right

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,229
now with that I'm gonna offer our eleven

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,460
easy steps and we're going to go through

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:41,460
them here one by one

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,419
alright number one we got provide

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,830
alternative text for non-text content

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,200
this is probably one of the easiest

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,070
things and this is the most common thing

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,389
that everybody everybody knows about

00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,970
alright when you add a picture to your

00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:00,190
media library in the backend I'm pretty

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,750
sure we're all familiar with this you're

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,110
gonna have this place right here to add

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,270
your alt text and you just want a nice

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,610
descriptive text they say no more than

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,280
200 I try to be less than about a

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:19,090
hundred about a good sentence or two

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:21,460
good descriptive sentence I have not

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,680
seen any data that that this helps us

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,020
deal with the alt text we typically do

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,950
like the description and title is what

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,260
we do when we do SEO and stuff like that

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,610
this is just a closer up of this it's a

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,290
picture of a device that allows you to

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,060
see with your tongue and that's actually

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:41,320
a real device and I that was from the

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:43,930
NFB that was pretty pretty cool with the

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,390
Gutenberg update they add this down here

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,580
this allows you to click an image and

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,020
tell the screen reader basically that is

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,030
decorative and that tells the screen

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,460
reader to just skip right over it so you

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,919
either have to have an alt tag or you

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,840
have to mark it as decorative one of

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:07,360
those two things has to happen for you

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:08,860
to be compliant if it has a picture on

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,470
your website it has to have either an

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:17,380
alt tag or label decorative no matter

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:19,840
what well this is where the gray area is

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,330
I mean it's not law for the average

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,070
individual but it's law for government

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,050
and it's law for anybody who's doing

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,220
business with government anybody doing

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,979
contract work at all

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,840
but if you look at the 2,200 lawsuits

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,240
that I put up there none of those are

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,870
section 508 lawsuits those are all title

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:42,250
4e lawsuits so to answer your question

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:44,709
if you have a little mom-and-pop website

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,000
you probably aren't gonna have to worry

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,950
too much about it because there's so

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,010
many other big fish in the sea to fry

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,260
but the fact is if your site is not if

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,640
there's an area of your site that cannot

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,920
be reached by an individual

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,980
using a piece of technology or as blind

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,360
you can can be sued it doesn't matter

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,620
whether your government doing business

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,660
with the government because again those

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,460
lawsuits are not under Section 508 then

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,990
under title 3 in title 3 says that an

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,880
individual does not have full access to

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,410
your website the same as any

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,430
brick-and-mortar and that's what's

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,870
happening they're taking all those

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:22,510
brick-and-mortar laws and just moving

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:23,950
them right over to the the web so yeah I

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:30,070
mean you go to government the Union you

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:31,420
can look up the law firm yes I mean I

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,010
have it on our site we've got it on

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,840
YouTube I'm sure WordCamp

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,090
Elena's gonna ask before and they'll

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,890
post it wherever they post it this whole

00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,340
presentation so you'll be able to look

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,520
at all of this absolutely alright number

00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:48,340
two label form elements I'm sure we all

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,210
got input values and stuff like that on

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,520
our website especially a contact form

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,190
this is very simple these are your form

00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,750
elements last name first name very

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:04,150
simple contact form 7 is a very popular

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,950
one they come their form elements

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,600
already come labeled unless you're

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,910
adding new ones and you're gonna have to

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,570
manually add them but contact form 7

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,270
works real well

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,530
I'm gravity form works too well - and

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,400
then I believe they have some plugins I

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:20,890
help with their accessibility ok number

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,900
3 add manuscript or closed captions for

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,680
videos and add audio description for

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,180
animations you're talking about a music

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,010
site I don't know if you actually have a

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:35,380
music site but this this will kind of

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:42,820
pertain to that this is a add manuscript

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:45,610
or closed captions if yeah alright an

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,560
example a closed caption YouTube how

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,820
many people here use YouTube to upload

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,170
videos to their to their sites and stuff

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,240
alright well we do we do all the time

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,980
and it's very easy you upload a video

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,930
you can SEO it up they give you a little

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,720
shortcode put in the back end and it

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,550
displays the video well YouTube what

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,870
most people don't realize and I didn't

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,540
realize until I got into the whole

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,650
accessibility thing is is YouTube the

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,100
blind community you

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:15,370
you tube to get a large portion of their

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:19,480
information because the way they make

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:22,690
they make it so easy so what you do is

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,480
when you upload a video you can go into

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,390
edit and you go to subtitles force ICC

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,120
take you to a little a little window and

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,350
it'll allow you to add closed captions

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,170
you can do it in multiple different ways

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,810
YouTube will do it for you you can add

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,430
it manually or upload a draft or you can

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,890
open it on the front end let anybody

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,790
who's watching manually chime in and

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:47,680
then you can okay it and then what that

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,860
does that opens up down here a little CC

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,270
button so if someone comes to - you know

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,830
this video they just click down and

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,600
automatically have it and YouTube's

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,520
really really good with that they do it

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,350
automatically I think if your videos

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,780
more than 15 20 minutes long it might

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,480
take an hour or two up to 24 hours from

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:11,380
them manually do your closed caption but

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:13,750
they will do it it's pretty awesome when

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,910
they do the automatic I've not been able

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:20,530
to edit their automatic but in the same

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:33,160
area you can manually do it so you know

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:34,030
yeah that's a tough one right right I

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,920
don't I don't

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,930
I've never compared this to other ones

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,400
but they tend to be pretty good I mean

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,140
they're gonna be mistakes like

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:53,800
everything else but they tend to be

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:55,420
pretty well pretty good because it takes

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,010
a little while he'll take a little offer

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,170
to kick in if your videos more to them

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:03,360
like I said for 10 15 20 minutes it

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,360
could take an hour - could take 24 hours

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,220
well I don't I don't understand the

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,220
question

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:26,170
all right right okay so unless the

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,300
individual uploading the video does that

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,580
there's nothing to do there's no the

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,710
YouTube doesn't automatically do that

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,320
either the person uploading the video

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,420
like when I upload a video I go in to my

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,250
edit video and then tell youtube to

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,710
automatically do that so unless that

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:50,440
individual did that then there's no CCS

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:52,480
for you to click on yes if you want to

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,900
yes absolutely

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,970
when you go to subtitles for CC and in

00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,770
it'll ask you to add if you want to add

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,780
subtitles and then it'll give you those

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,150
options you can automatically do it

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,800
manually do it or release it on the open

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:10,600
on the front and let people chime in and

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,220
do it so it's pretty cool all right an

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,110
example of audio description this is

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,070
very rarely done but it's just as

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:21,280
important this right here I just took

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,720
this snippet um this video The Lion King

00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,790
I'm sure everybody's familiar with the

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,670
Lion King well the opening scenes this

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,800
this lady on the YouTube used about two

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,130
minutes to two minutes 23 seconds 23

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,740
seconds she used this to just show how

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:38,560
to add audio description and what this

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,180
is is um you can use this this little

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,150
this little shortcode here and it'll

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,740
take you to this two-minute clip but the

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,390
opening scene is just a bunch of music

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,190
you got a bunch of animals going up to

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,260
Pride Rock and then they hold a little

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,780
lion up in the air and all that stuff

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,420
but there's no there's no words through

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:59,350
this two minutes so what happens is this

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,270
lady talks while this has happened she's

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,850
described just like what I did

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,190
bunch of animals going up the the green

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,400
grassy knoll it's a Pride Rock and then

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:11,680
the bird swoops in and the lion holds

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,140
the the little line up in the air she's

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,910
just describing the scene if there's no

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:21,670
words and that's that's very important

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:24,280
as well alright ensure color contrast

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,830
to minimum thresholds it's another very

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,290
easy one color contrast should be a

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,030
minimum four and a half to one with the

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,220
exception of links in text they can be

00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,300
three to one my personal opinion I just

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,530
wish they would have said everything

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,050
needs to be four and a half the one

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,150
would have made it easier but they give

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:44,230
you a little leeway all right this is an

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:47,310
example of bad contrasts I mean it just

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,750
speaks for itself this it's terrible

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,370
that's an example of good contrast you

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,190
can just absolutely see the difference

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,720
just you know just a couple of color

00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:01,480
choices you're making a big difference

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:05,140
for somebody all right number five make

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,480
all linked text descriptive now a little

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,490
side note between this and alternative

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,130
text I can go to almost every site and

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,400
fail somebody because I can almost

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,530
always find a picture without a text

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,140
without an alternative text and I can

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,230
find a link that says click here or

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,720
something like that

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,490
yes yeah we run audits and then we'll

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,250
come back if they want us to remediate

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,600
we after we run the audit we teach we

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,460
tell them exactly where their problems

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,440
are show their IT team how to fix it if

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,180
it's beyond their capacity they'll just

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,350
hand it back to us and tell us to

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,730
remediate it but it's kind of like a

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,830
two-phase process okay for an exam for a

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,080
bad example of link description click

00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:50,470
here or read more like I said almost I

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:54,370
have done this so many times until I

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:58,630
realized how bad it was so I'm not

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,950
laying judgment on everybody for an

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,760
example of a good link description

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:05,350
follow this link to Wikipedia the reason

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,209
why this is is because an individual

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,949
using a screen reader typically the

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,420
screener will skip content and they'll

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,550
just hit headers and it'll just hit

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,459
links so when it hits these links it'll

00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:18,490
say link click here or link read more it

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,560
won't it would not have talked about the

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,790
like the context the context clues

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,490
ourselves you won't know what you read

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,220
 you won't know where your where

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,260
your clicking going so when it gets down

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,510
here on the proper one it'll say link

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,580
Wikipedia so now that individual knows

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,809
when they click that link they're going

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:41,249
to Wikipedia

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:44,019
not some random cyberspace place alright

00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:46,330
number six the color of any given

00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:48,759
content cannot be the only indication of

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:52,240
meaning this has this basically has to

00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:54,789
do with like colorblind individuals I

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,799
think it's 8% or 9% of men eventually

00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:58,809
become colorblind one or two percent of

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,149
women eventually become colorblind so no

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:02,919
matter what we talk about disability one

00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:03,519
out of 10 adults is gonna have this

00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,379
issue

00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:10,059
eventually okay here using color to

00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,129
convey meaning for input fields

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,259
incorrect example this is how the screen

00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:16,299
reader is gonna read it required fields

00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,799
are in read name and email now if you

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,259
closed your eyes you wouldn't know which

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,639
one is required out of that required

00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:23,529
fields are in read name an email I

00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:26,019
wouldn't know so what you got to do is

00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:28,450
you come over here require fields are in

00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:30,700
read in marked with an asterisk name

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,830
email asterisks and that's how the

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,440
screen reader is going to read it so now

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:38,409
I know email the one with the asterisks

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,159
is the required field very very simple

00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:44,200
stuff all right we got down here a

00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,240
little problem here here's the incorrect

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,129
example which is the right angle

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,840
triangle green blue red yellow don't

00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:52,749
know if I'm colorblind

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,990
I don't know that these which triangle

00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:57,460
correlates with the proper answer so to

00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,869
fix that we'll all you're gonna do is

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,909
you're gonna add some numbers in here

00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:04,029
and make sure that they match you know

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:06,149
Green is wrong blue is too so now when

00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:10,360
I'm reading this math problem or this

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:12,639
geometry problem I know which triangle

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,259
correlates this and I'm able to now get

00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:17,999
the correct answer without those numbers

00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:17,999
I wouldn't know if I was colorblind

00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:28,330
alright make your font size at least

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,179
sixteen easiest thing you could possibly

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,679
do is I know it's a little big but it is

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:34,990
the way it is I think the actual rules

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,600
fifteen to sixteen it depends on whether

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,279
or not some you know on what font type

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,950
your user sums bigger than others

00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,570
whether it's bold stuff like that but

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,889
the general rule of thumb make sure it's

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,700
at least sixteen and you're good to go

00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:50,890
alright your air

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,570
handling if there's an input error by

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,610
the user it must be identified and

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,730
described in the text explaining the air

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,270
to the user it's much easier than it

00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,860
sounds

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,050
basically you go to a contact form

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,510
whoops I forgot to add the title we can

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:07,000
see with an Asterix it's it's mandatory

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,880
oops I forgot to add my last name you

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,190
hit enter this is how your form should

00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,740
speak to the individual I added these

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,960
red boxes you don't need that but this

00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:20,110
house is please review your errors below

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,240
title is required last name is required

00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,550
that tells them where they went wrong

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:30,340
and they're able to sift through that

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:33,760
and add the proper information all right

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,100
tab navigation your entire website

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,710
should be able to be navigated by using

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:43,870
only your keyboard and do not ignore the

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:45,670
focus State focus state is okay let's

00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,430
assume you're going to a website you

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,470
just go to a website when you hit the

00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,820
tab button generally the first thing

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,670
that's gonna pop up as you'll see a

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,410
little box pop up that's focus state it

00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,580
tells you what your folk tells the

00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,530
individual what they're focused on

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,130
because if you keep hitting your tab

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,470
button

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,450
it's called tab navigation it should

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,220
flow like in this order down a

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,500
predictable order down your website and

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,910
every time your tab lands on something

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,460
you've got to know that that's where

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,100
your tab is so generally a little box

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,200
goes around it and just let you know

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,700
that that's what's you're focused on so

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,890
if you hit enter you're you're clicking

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:42,010
that otherwise you won't know where your

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:43,600
tab is no focused at only the only thing

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,380
the focus State does is tell you where

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:52,170
it is it just it's a visual landmark of

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,170
telling you okay this is where my tab is

00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,470
jump to that call me going down it must

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,390
certainly do one column at a time um no

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,400
I mean it depends I mean you can have it

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,650
set up but generally they go from left

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,990
to right go down left the right all the

00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:16,190
way across kind of like a typewriter

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:18,260
generally that's how they go right you

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,820
can have it set up screener to set up

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,050
certain ways like most people have it

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,240
set up to where it just goes through

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,350
your links and your headers so what

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,420
they'll do is they'll go through their

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,280
h1 headers and it'll read the h1 header

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,410
if they want to read more content about

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,630
that they'll hit Enter or something then

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,460
it'll hit the body otherwise it's just

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:37,730
it's just kind of skipping through the

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,440
site you know that if you listen to if

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,820
you ever if you go to youtube I highly

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,770
recommend going to YouTube and and

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,660
searching for somebody using a screen

00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,880
reader the way they use it is amazing

00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,320
it's like an auctioneer the speed that

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,300
they have this thing on them the way

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,530
they they navigate the site it's amazing

00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,650
it's amazing it's really mind-blowing

00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:00,610
yes and at the end I give you some some

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,000
free screen readers to check out stuff

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,400
all right

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,230
you must offer flexible time limits if

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,960
any associated with the website or

00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,610
software now I kind of talk out of both

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,680
sides of my mouth on this one because

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,840
here I am accessibility talk telling you

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,000
not to give them time limits but when we

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,320
give our WordPress security talk we tell

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,170
you give them time limits and logout

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,550
idle users so I think there's a happy in

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,380
between you definitely need to log out

00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,090
idle users especially when you're

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,010
dealing with credit cards and bangs and

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,380
things like that any type of financial

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,760
stuff or pertinent information so what

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,500
you want to do is when you're when your

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,330
time limits come and do you want up

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,830
maybe you have a big button pop up and

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,740
say you're about to run out of time

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,900
click this button to gain an extra

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,630
minute 5 minutes 20 minutes or whatever

00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,790
you want but make it very easy for that

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,890
individual to gain more time because

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,440
it's super important for security they

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,940
kind of have to be logged out but you

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,920
can imagine you're struggling already

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,290
struggling to navigate this website

00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,760
you're 5-10 minutes into it and you get

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,210
logged out and you got to start all over

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,040
again that's you know I don't think

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,110
that's gonna get you sued but it's not

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:11,330
about being sued it's about helping the

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:12,710
end user so alright number 11 provides

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,120
skip nav

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,880
so that the users can skip repetitive

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,110
content such as mad mennies and widgets

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,060
now this touches a little bit what

00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,730
you're talking about how you can make it

00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,690
skip and skip around you add Skip

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,290
Mavericks

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,910
this is this is a huge deal too because

00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:31,490
like I explained if an average person or

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,860
a disabled or blind individual goes to a

00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,170
website first thing they do is they hit

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,270
his first thing they do is hit tab boom

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:40,400
this the something will light up right

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,920
here typically saying this is where you

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,900
are now what you want to do is you want

00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,730
to the very first time someone hits tab

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,500
you want to you want that to go to a

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,090
skip link which is what we're talking

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,430
about here and what that skip link does

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,130
is it skips all the repetitive content

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,230
we all have big beautiful drop-down

00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,090
menus that we build because we want you

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,580
to go to every single page on our side

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,460
and wheel all of our drop-down menus but

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,220
the problem with those is that when a a

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,350
low vision individual goes to every

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,530
single page they got to navigate that

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:14,120
huge that huge drop-down menu and all

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,640
these other bells and whistles you got

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,070
before the content they got to navigate

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,220
on every single page so if they want to

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,280
go to another page on your site they've

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,610
got to go through all that processes

00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:31,100
unless you add a skip navigate tab it'll

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,050
say skip the content or something and

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,670
they can click that and skip the skip

00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,980
the drop-down menu go straight to the

00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,580
content that's a big deal that's that's

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:42,170
a major major help all right now this

00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,390
came straight from WordPress this an

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:47,810
example from WordPress on this this just

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:50,180
gives how you do some some skip links in

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,830
the backend and stuff inside the

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,990
landmark for consistency inside the

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:58,040
header landmark and it'll skip down here

00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:00,200
to these kinds of things or you can just

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,540
go download this plug-in which we have

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,310
no affiliation with this plug-in no

00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,140
don't make you no mone money I mean this

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,460
plug-in is free anyways but we've got no

00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,280
affiliation with this plug-in it's just

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,170
a good plugin and then once you download

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,450
and activate it the very first thing on

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,390
it is enable skip link so you just click

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,790
that pretty much I've not seen a newer

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,860
theme that does not come with skip links

00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,620
already but we've all got those clients

00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,910
that just don't want to change that have

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,000
all themes don't want to pay

00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,650
to upgrade and all that stuff so if so

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,300
if you run across those situations

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,270
there's workarounds you can very easily

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,690
add this plug-in or go go in the back

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:43,450
and in the back and add this this here

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:49,070
for you so there are options all right

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:51,350
that is pretty much our 11 easy steps if

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,970
you want this is this is a good picture

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,560
taking material right here you take a

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,510
picture of this and this you know if

00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,300
you're able I do want to say a quick

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:01,100
thing about this though if you follow

00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,460
every single one of these eleven steps

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,910
to the tee and do everything joe said to

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,280
do

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:10,370
you're still not compliant you're still

00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,010
not we can be here for hours and hours

00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:15,950
talking about compliance the purpose of

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,020
this is we started as developers

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,990
designing and building sites and

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,550
software if we would have known how easy

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:27,530
it was to make our sites compliant and

00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:31,130
inclusive and accessible we would have

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,450
been we add this to our process of

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,280
building sites on we would have been

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,380
doing this from the beginning if we were

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,560
to realize how easy it was and how big

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:42,020
of a difference this makes so you're not

00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,750
protected from lawsuits you're still not

00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:47,320
fully compliant but if we all do this

00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:51,500
right here we will make a difference

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,470
okay here's some free tools for you user

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:57,110
wait org if I could get you to do

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,420
anything when you get home it is add

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:02,650
this plug-in to your site I mean I'm

00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:06,140
gonna I'm gonna ask you another favor

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:09,680
but this is one of them if you go to our

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,020
website st. Pete design com STP ete

00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,910
design com you'll see this plug-in in

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,620
action again this is another one this

00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,150
has nothing to do with us this is not

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,280
our plugin we don't make nothing off

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,770
this plugin it's just a fantastic easy

00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,350
plugin what this does is adds a little

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,510
icon ours is right here so when you go

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,940
to our site an individual can click that

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,670
and the menu pops up and it allows them

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,660
to do things like increase text size by

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,870
200%

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,660
add contrast fix the contrast ratio on

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,680
everything set it up to where your

00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,140
site's nothing but base

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,070
links it gives them lots of options so

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,710
if you're not gonna do something

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:50,360
yourself just add that and at least

00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:53,750
gives them the options to do things all

00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:57,200
right the next couple of tools are what

00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:03,500
we use part of our toolbox for running

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:05,210
audits we got wave webaim very easy site

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,610
you can either add it as a Chrome

00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,700
extension or just go to their site and

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:13,160
then copy paste your URL and put it in

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,170
there and they'll do a quick automatic

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,690
audit of your site and show you errors

00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,220
and stuff were you having issues google

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,870
lighthouse does the same thing it's in

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:25,760
your Chrome it's in your Chrome browser

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,980
it's very easy to do it runs an

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,920
automatic test gives you a score between

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:34,670
1 and a hundred tells you where it is

00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:38,180
you suck but it also gives you a list of

00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:40,040
12 manual steps to check your sites that

00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:47,120
automated test cannot check which is

00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:48,560
very useful okay and I'm gonna skip down

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,030
here cuz you got access this is another

00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,040
testing tool this is another great

00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,710
testing tool for Chrome you know as an

00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,410
extension this this this one is one of

00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,210
my personal favorites just because it's

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:01,160
more conservative than the other ones

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,670
and it gives you less false positives

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,600
every single testing tool there is will

00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:10,700
give you false positives false negatives

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,710
that's just the way it is you that's why

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,510
we use we use about five different

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:17,210
pieces of automated testing software

00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,590
when we test our our sites and then we

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,230
go through and do all of our manual

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:24,050
testing and that's I'm in we've tried

00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,400
paid plugins paid software there there

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:29,450
seems to be nothing out there there that

00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:31,850
that doesn't do that there's the ax for

00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,320
Chrome yes I'm another one I thought I

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:37,370
had it up here I don't have it up here

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,840
Wally wa1 one why oh that's right it's

00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,460
here but it's in ok well this one here

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,490
WordPress accessibility tool is an alt

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,040
text finder this is our plugin this is

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,920
completely free not freemium but

00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,270
completely free always will be free this

00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,060
is not why I'm here today

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,600
so this this plugin is my personal

00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,040
favorite

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,310
I mean we all think our baby's the

00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,990
prettiest but this finds all your

00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:03,380
missing alt tags this is a big deal

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,670
because all tags are easy to fix easy to

00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,190
do as you're going but if you got to go

00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:08,780
back and remediate it's tough because

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,660
you got to go through and fix every

00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:13,310
photo in your media library and then you

00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,620
got to go find that photo on the front

00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,390
end and fix it because it does not

00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,100
translate if you add alt text in the

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,990
media library it does not push it to the

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,550
front end so you're doing that work two

00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,170
maybe even three times if you got that

00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,510
picture and a couple different locations

00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,610
what this does is this on the back end

00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,320
brings all of your pictures together and

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,850
then you can and you can click a button

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,590
it says missing alt tagging I'll send

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,030
all your pictures to the top that's a

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,100
missing alt tags you're gonna have the

00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,660
alt and then it also grabs all the

00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,580
pictures from your front end and you can

00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,460
add them there too so it's it makes it

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,620
so much easier

00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,800
fixing alt tags is very easy but it's a

00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,630
very time-consuming very time-consuming

00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,070
ok we also give you a contrast ratio on

00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,840
the back end allows you to check your

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,370
contrast ratios you can add your

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,170
foreground background tells you what

00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,900
your ratio is whether you've pass-fail

00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:02,300
it also gives you an example and then we

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,310
also added a way cat 2.1 checklist if

00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,970
you go to w3c which I'll give you on the

00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,370
next slide

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,950
the actual way cat guidelines back

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,510
they're all in government speak all the

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,100
blue and white it's a pain in the butt

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,920
what we did is we went through and we

00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:19,370
tried to we try to turn it into English

00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:23,150
make it understandable to two dummies

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:25,130
like me and then we also add this Wally

00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,980
testing software which I was which I was

00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,740
talking about this is this is a lot like

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,180
ax it does a lot of the same stuff ax is

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,640
a little bit better because it gives you

00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:38,330
less false positives but this wall is

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,550
very good as well and again it's in our

00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,840
plugin so you just turn that on and you

00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,300
go to the front end of your site while

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,010
you're logged in and it'll give you a

00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,110
little icon down here a box will pop up

00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:51,130
and let you check your headers contrast

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,080
or AD ratios links all that descriptions

00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:55,850
it's very very useful

00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,320
cool thing about the Wally is is if

00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,300
you're looking at headers or contrast

00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,210
fresh or whatever you're looking at

00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,890
another box pops up okay well let's say

00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,860
that this is this is what has an issue

00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,430
we'll just say this has a contrast issue

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,890
what happened

00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:12,410
a little icon will pop up saying this is

00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,820
your problem and then that's where your

00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,950
problem is then another box will pop up

00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,170
showing what your problem is it talks

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:21,260
about your contact ratio and then the

00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:24,350
cool thing it'll suggest colors for you

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,240
say like our site is blue and green and

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,760
our green is right on the line so it'll

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,130
suggest a darker green to bring you to

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,110
four point five one just over the

00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,800
threshold of compliance but that's

00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,960
pretty cool

00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,640
it'll give you a code snippet of where

00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,080
it's wrong and stuff so that's that's

00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,120
pretty awesome and then we also give you

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:46,820
some great resources a lot of stuff

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,810
there all right these are the screen

00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,420
readers I was talking about

00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:53,680
NVDA was actually created by blind

00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:56,810
developers for script for this screeners

00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,820
and I can't think of anybody better to

00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:03,140
develop a screen reader than a blind

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:05,360
developer and it's free so you know it's

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,220
curtain then we got chromevox chromevox

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,200
is easier to download because obviously

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,830
in chrome browser it's just an extension

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,830
very easy to download but NVDA is the

00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:18,280
better of the two by far of screen

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:21,650
readers and a little piece of advice

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,380
know where the off button is before you

00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:26,120
turn the on button on on these things

00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,560
because it it's frustrating when you

00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,100
can't find the off button and your

00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,170
computer is yelling at you constantly I

00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:36,440
feel like it's just yelling dummy dummy

00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,820
dummy dummy I can't find anything all

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,770
right here's some resources for you I

00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,860
just made some short codes just to just

00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:45,080
to save space these are the actual

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:48,370
weight tag 2.1 guidelines you go to the

00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,810
w3c and that's the actual real deal

00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:53,150
guidelines and I remember for section 5

00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:58,450
away you only need to be level a and

00:34:53,150 --> 00:35:00,860
double-a compliant doj withdrawing their

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:03,170
recommendations a few years ago they're

00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,330
supposed to have the law put out I

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:08,150
believe in January February of last year

00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:11,330
but the DL J withdraw withdrew their

00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:13,610
recommendations here's a list of law

00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,930
suits for the first two months of 2018

00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,510
that's only the first few months but

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,520
it's hundreds of lawsuits and it's cool

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,190
because this article will allow you to

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,530
click the lawsuit and then you go

00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,369
- the actual lawsuit and you can read

00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,869
all about it

00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:32,980
it's amazing I mean huge websites Amazon

00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:34,690
Nike Rolex Ticketmaster you would think

00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,730
these guys would be compliant but

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:39,160
they're they're billion-dollar companies

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:41,950
but they weren't compliant

00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,839
we got an article here about the 2,200

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,940
lawsuit it's just a pretty neat little

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,800
article then we got a comparison table

00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,780
of section 5 way they just came out with

00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,940
the new four point I'm sorry two point

00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,280
one guidelines I believe it was probably

00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,020
six months ago eight months ago and this

00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,900
comparison table shows you what's

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,190
different between way CAC 2.0 and way

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,920
CAC 2.1

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:04,720
a couple of small differences but but

00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,369
they're important because there are some

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,099
things that weren't handled in 2.0

00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:10,569
things like logos and text on pictures

00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:13,050
and things like that there was some gray

00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:15,700
area and they've addressed those

00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,170
WordPress accessibility info this is

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,520
straight from the WordPress site they

00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,440
actually give you pretty good info

00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,640
who'da thunk it you know you go to their

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,980
site and you can actually learn about

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:27,520
accessibility I've pulled a few snippets

00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:30,790
out of this talk from from there and

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,780
this right here this is the actual law

00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:37,480
that's in place this came into place I

00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,089
think December 21st of last year so it's

00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,490
been about five months or so this is

00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:44,589
that this is the real deal law and this

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:47,020
is for government agencies and anybody

00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:49,450
who does business with the government

00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,609
agencies anybody who contracts with them

00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,410
they actually because we've we've

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,760
actually done a couple of sites for

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,220
people who contract for the government

00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,839
just for them to even bid they have to

00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,329
fill out a piece of paper saying and

00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,069
signing off that they are section 508

00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:04,630
compliant their website is compliant if

00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:08,079
their website is not compliant they

00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,730
can't even put in a bid so it's they say

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,380
it's the law for government agencies but

00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,930
it's government agencies if anybody

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,290
doing business this is an accessibility

00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:19,390
statement creator this is from the w3c

00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:22,300
themselves you can't get any more real

00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:25,150
deal than that this is very important

00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,190
this is yeah this is the other thing I

00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,710
asked you guys to do to put an

00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,140
accessibility statement in your footer

00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:33,490
what this does is you go to w3c and they

00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,320
just ask you a bunch of questions and

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:40,120
you just fill out a form takes about 20

00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:43,040
it asks you you know what your site is

00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,840
what you've done to test your site what

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,730
areas you're not compliant or having

00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:50,210
issues with what you're doing to fix

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:51,800
them how how an individual can contact

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,450
you if they're having a problem with

00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,800
their website and you got to remember

00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:59,390
this is very big giving people an outlet

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,430
you know if an individual goes to your

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,200
site and can't and can't navvy and have

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,690
issues it's gonna make them real mad

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,310
well we all know from customer service

00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,230
you give if you give a customer or an

00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,910
individual an outlet to communicate

00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:13,190
their issues you can solve a lot of

00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,510
problems immediately so if you give them

00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,740
that outlet to it they're having a

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,650
problem with your site instead of

00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,270
getting on a lawyer and Sue in or or

00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,740
however they want to handle it if they

00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,210
have an option to call you up and let

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,010
you know hey I'm having a problem with

00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,730
this area of your website and you

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,140
respond and say thank you so much we

00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,180
know that's a problem and we're working

00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:34,910
on it you can you can alleviate you can

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:39,470
defuse a lot of situations just like

00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:41,990
that and if lawyers anybody out there

00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:44,690
you know it's happening and this this

00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,340
talk is not about not about lawsuit

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,280
prevention it's about helping the end

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,420
user and it really is but the fact of

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,700
the matter is when you're dealing with

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,170
clients you got to talk to them like

00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,420
that you got to let them know that it's

00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,130
because every time I tell a client about

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,020
accessibility they look at me like I'm

00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,900
just trying to get more money out of

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,810
them like I'm just trying to work on but

00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,120
you know the fact is is it's mandatory

00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,460
and it's making a difference lawsuits

00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,020
are happening so my point being if you

00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,610
got an accessibility statement in your

00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,710
footer and you've got that little icon

00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,140
from user way on the front of your site

00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,940
you're better than most people out there

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,310
and just like a stick there ADT sticker

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,900
on your window if a burglar is coming to

00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,280
your house and sees that he's just gonna

00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,290
go to the house next door that doesn't

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,480
have a sticker because it's just easier

00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:31,180
the lawyers and individuals are gonna do

00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,520
the same thing if you are if you are

00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:36,080
proactive in your accessibility more

00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,340
than likely they're gonna skip over you

00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:42,110
and go to the next guy who's done

00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:44,380
nothing all right we got any questions

00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,940
that's this was pretty much about it

00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,730
there any questions on accessibility or

00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:53,319
anything

00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:55,030
no st. Pete but we do I mean we do

00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:57,460
worldwide we're dealing with we also

00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,710
deal with GDP are over with Europe and

00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,799
stuff so these things kind of are

00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:05,530
similar there there it is law for them

00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:08,530
it is law for everybody it has to be

00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:13,480
that way now so yes yes it's this

00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:15,190
hardcore over there I they have not

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,619
asked me to provide them yet I will

00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:20,770
there on if you go to our website under

00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:22,270
talks we've got I've got this talk and

00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:28,630
I've actually got our slides up there

00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:31,900
but it's st. St PE te design st. Pete

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:33,400
design calm and then you go up the talks

00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,770
and we've got a bunch of talks in the

00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,099
first couple of talks is this actual

00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:40,750
presentation and then I also have a

00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,950
video up there of just the slides I just

00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,250
went through PowerPoint just made a

00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,630
slide video so you don't got a yes you

00:40:45,250 --> 00:41:04,270
know listen to my annoying voice the

00:40:46,630 --> 00:41:06,460
whole time yes yeah the question so the

00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,740
question is your beginner is this useful

00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:15,190
for you I'm gonna say absolutely yes

00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:17,410
because the 11 steps I offer is meant to

00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,299
just add to your process of designing

00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,970
and building your website if you're

00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:25,660
doing these things as you go you will

00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:27,549
not excuse me you will not feel feel it

00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:30,069
you know you will have minimal time

00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:32,740
added to your project I mean it really

00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:34,480
is you just don't feel it and as you go

00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,750
and then we're really helping people so

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,760
in WordPress runs over a third of the

00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,609
Internet I mean I think the second

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,950
largest CMS is like 7% 8% something like

00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:47,559
some ridiculous number so we're the ones

00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,510
if anybody if anybody in the internet

00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:52,150
world is going to make a difference it's

00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:55,180
people in this room no matter what your

00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,319
experience level we can I wish I had

00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,549
known this and started from the

00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,590
beginning but it is what it is now

00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:04,750
another thing too in California

00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,910
the for a couple months ago the first

00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:10,390
time a developer got sued for not

00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:11,680
building a website accessible so we all

00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,240
know California that's where things

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,610
first start to happen and then they work

00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:19,300
their way out into the real world so

00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:20,800
that's coming so that's coming so be

00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,450
careful with that and I've talked to I

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,370
just came back from LA actually last

00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,050
weekend given a talk at WordCamp and I

00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:27,970
met a couple of developers there and

00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,500
what they're doing is they're going back

00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,480
to all their previous clients and

00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,810
telling them either you got two options

00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,580
either make your site accessible or sign

00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:40,090
this release form saying that I'm not

00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,760
liable for your website and 100% of the

00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:45,340
clients say okay make my site accessible

00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:50,230
so they're ginning up a lot of business

00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:58,150
this way I don't know we got any other

00:42:50,230 --> 00:43:00,790
questions yes ma'am I do not I can

00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,800
understand why me why New York my

00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:04,870
thinking was I would think New York and

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,820
California be the two biggest right well

00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:08,590
California I think says had 40 last year

00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,480
well going to LA and talking to

00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,940
developers there what apparently is

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,530
happening was there was a there was a

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,990
lawsuit in a judge handed down a

00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:19,300
judgment that made it not advantageous

00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,890
for them to bring a lawsuits up through

00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,140
the federal so they all started suing

00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,630
through the state state level instead of

00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,940
federal so my stat is just federal 2,200

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,260
lawsuits federal nationwide well

00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:35,290
apparently there was about two or three

00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:37,030
thousand lottery close okay okay most

00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:39,070
most of the lawsuits are to say so two

00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:49,570
three thousand lawsuits from California

00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:55,630
are happening you had a question yes

00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:57,490
huge yes absolutely when you run these

00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,600
tests the tests I showed you the one of

00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,980
the first things that pop up for your

00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,380
header levels they got to be in order

00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,450
when and it has to do with in logical

00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,090
order the question was about headers are

00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,530
they important yes header h1 h2 is they

00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:11,260
got to be in order you can't skip them

00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:14,140
if you typically start with an h1 and

00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,760
then you go h2 h3 h4 you come you know

00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,040
come down here they'd like you to do an

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,210
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,470
to H 3 H 4 H 2 s or H 4 but you don't

00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:24,260
want to skip you don't want to go from H

00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,700
1 H 3 H 2 H 4 the reason why that is

00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,500
because if they're navigating tab

00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,780
navigating it's gonna send you all over

00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,790
the place and you will end the law your

00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,550
breaking is you're not in a predictable

00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:43,970
order anymore and that is actually

00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:47,360
against the law I caught you right no

00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:49,280
it's it's hugely important absolutely so

00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,440
I appreciate you guys coming out thank

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,719
