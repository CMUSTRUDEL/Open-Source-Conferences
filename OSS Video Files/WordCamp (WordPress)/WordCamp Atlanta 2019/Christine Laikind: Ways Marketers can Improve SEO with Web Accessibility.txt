Title: Christine Laikind: Ways Marketers can Improve SEO with Web Accessibility
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	When a website is inaccessible, it is not just an issue of compliance, it is just bad practice on display. People with disabilities ranging from blindness, deafness, dyslexia and others may navigate and consume content in different ways with assistive technology (like screen readers, captioning or joy sticks). Therefore it is not that difficult to understand why lack of accessibility negatively impacts SEO. Web accessibility is not just for developers, it is just as important for marketers to make it part of their digital marketing to ensure that opportunities for success arenâ€™t missed.

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,619
and want to make sure they were going to

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,930

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,620
hold off the Q&A still going after

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,410
question I'm going to come look at the

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,020
screen to read a question both that I

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,570
would try to look at who I was asking

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,149
the question but that I can assure you

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,770
okay

00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:48,750
but what you know that I was born deaf

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,829
in the food due to a genetic defect

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,840
between my parents okay it'll stay calm

00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:00,270
and another see first I can't pronounce

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:04,830
it it's lung and but Dad you got another

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,439
unfortunate it happens when one no

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,220
female on the grout take a look and then

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,380
it come together and they put a screen

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,530
there a bone Jeff I have a younger

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,350
brother who's also deaf so when I was

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,710
born I happen to be a blue baby stove

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,170
the plane did at that time my deafness

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,979
the color I was a blue baby a breech

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,290
pluck embarked aboard umbilical cord

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,479
wrapped around my neck now I'm a brother

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,360
on the other hand he was perfect kicking

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,729
my firing it wasn't until here of born

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,079
they discovered that they carried a

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,000
genetic defect okay and I do know

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,939
American Sign Language but I don't use

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,500
it because of my opinion I'm the only my

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,899
family my brother and I Olli that

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,500
children everybody else is hearing so as

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,990
I thought no one really alone starting

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,799
off it's not a philosophy that we were

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,479
however we know of anybody better - I

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,729
hope that they are learning American

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,190
Sign Language it is a better form of

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,239
communication if you think lovely ring

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,239
is the best way to communicate

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,030
but the food other people but that's how

00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,209
I get by

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,909
I love food local people and communicate

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:28,329
with other people I consider myself a

00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:31,329
pretty good leader sometimes it's not

00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:33,700
always the best way for me to understand

00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:40,989
other food box that were American style

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:43,150
content handy and I am i owner go

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,909
through marketing

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,870
I provide services but because coach

00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:52,599
trainers and right now for the last

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,150
couple years picture myself as a

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,450
advocacy speaker the web accessibility

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,720
and inclusion go back with my missing

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:06,340
and whose dog a birth couple network of

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,819
people did I know in the doctor ability

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,040
vote and in the inclusion bird and I

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:13,569
found that I'm walking the line in the

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,629
middle between people to have

00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:19,510
disabilities and people in companies

00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,940
that want to know how to bring the two

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,299
together

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:29,230
okay style what we're going to do today

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:31,180
I want to make sure that you're well I

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,079
might be talking about web accessibility

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,669
and post engine optimization I'm going

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,540
to make a nice couple assumption that

00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,829
you know what web accessibility years

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,150
you have an idea what web accessibility

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:49,299
is but I found some of it and the other

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:52,060
assumption news that you know doing

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:54,729
optimization is at least have an

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:59,290
understanding of what the best practices

00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:02,470
of search engine optimization practices

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,430
are those are the two functions I'm

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:08,819
going to make as I go through the

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,260
presentation if you were a journey

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:14,919
presentation this morning I know it's up

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:20,260
here but I'm gonna be a different level

00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:22,990
we'll have more of on page SEO and then

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:26,420
the web accessibility I'm gonna be

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,570
touching on will certain rules web stuff

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,560
a guideline and how they overlap and

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,260
when I'm finished

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,480
I'm hopping like a light back over go up

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,750
in the head you can see how the two come

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,390
together all right

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:47,570

I went to the human school system in the

00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:45,569
seventies and eighties in the early

the loud company no smaller companies

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,009

00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:17,300
they're gonna start with that point

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:21,700
beans dead inclusion it's the right

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:27,110
thing to do to make the website even

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:30,710
mobile applications dr. Parr in a

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:34,850
culture where everyone including those

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,900
who have a disability so let's address

00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:40,250
some of the myths

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:44,180
I've heard them all of mine Emma the

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:47,110
correct to Mars we do the start to make

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,110
the world a talked about

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,620
willing no benefit for the return on

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,750
investment

00:08:51,620 --> 00:09:00,290
I'm not gonna web but dice to buy it

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:07,460
will interfere with the functionality or

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:13,000
the design of the website is really no

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:18,260
joke are bad and making a website

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,150
accessible through the benefit the worth

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:26,320
of return on investment and actually an

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:31,010
admin site

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:35,270
it was a dining time with a good usual

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:39,410
experience benefits everyone including

00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:44,210
your business you get a return more

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:50,210
return visitor how you are composing how

00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:52,370
is the engine with that start the

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:55,070
backers website that take web

00:09:52,370 --> 00:10:01,090
accessibility stay okay conditionally

00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:05,200
went higher than Google in on YouTube

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:07,850
and I'm a point on that those engine

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,470
optimization best practices and some of

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:19,520
the web content accessibility guideline

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:21,590
actually over that so 200 things some of

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,720
the accessibility first we need to

00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,220
understand how the web is being used by

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,180
those who have a disability

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:32,690
we have a caller specific devices and

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,990
then the keyboard screen readers and

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:39,200
Tapani with crayons crap okay so in my

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,320
case I'm a deaf person I need and I

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,530
depend on captioning and transcripts a

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,680
bang person who the impaired person

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:52,310
needs a screen reader

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:56,510
posting that mobile in mobile with mojo

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:59,150
Spanish or paralyzed Dave made news to

00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,600
get by with a keyboard with a tab on a

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,410
keyboard

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,810
Joystiq what cut a path and a no-step

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,820
and path okay but if you could the

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,160
pearlite from a knockdown they have a

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,790
device that connected around the neck

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:20,020

key book okay

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:29,680
stow and then how do you design a

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:34,680
website also impact the the effect of

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:38,020
the testability so what you need to know

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,660
the web content accessibility guideline

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,750

distracted I'd tend to be a little

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,600
permanent because it's something that

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,940
related for web accessibility when

you're thinking about the screen reader

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,240
trying to read the content to a person

00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:57,240

if we have not heard of screenreader we

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,230
can kind out loud too

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,760
if we come across a website that has a

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,150
lot of contacts knock knock

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,370
when I play cold rice and think about it

00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,070
for Mama

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:26,110
trying to imagine someone reading your

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:29,320

read the banner web site it could better

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,540
organize what

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:41,620
break it up let me do a better work on a

00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,840
flat that's why we talked about making

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:47,950
sure the content is well we're gonna

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:51,790
move either by so we'll talk about user

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:56,380
experience a lap use pad for hurry and a

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:59,620
possible yep pastor but you've won main

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:03,100
header per Pig the fact that I know if

00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,870
not but going to talk about her we're

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,450
talking about each one then there's a

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:09,640
two and it's three please you can

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,040
package it and again this pertains to a

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,860
screen reader it's queried a week that a

00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:18,610
coordinate danaka is wider than a swing

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,530
but if one is for it confused with the

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,190
screen reader to reading out loud who

00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:28,240
about in person that you see I have

00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:32,290
anything about here I have h1 h2 h3 you

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,750
can go is 182 is to a cat at our screen

00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,780
reader this is the main header than

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:42,960
those two table headers that's okay all

00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:46,559
right so if 3 is another type header

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,600
that's why you cannot go firm is 103

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:54,520
because it's Queen worth nothing person

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:57,790

computer has a built-in screen reader

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,970

applying personally Drive Jay a couple

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:12,100
us but even using your own to

00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,470
that in half it's gonna beat the

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,920

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,020
I have clients

00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,950
upload images

00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,950
to their websites

00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,570
original art

00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:50,380
you know

00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,380
the image files

00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:00,720
protocol with dashes right

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:17,000
but okay

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:50,520
initials - date - and then maybe

00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:52,200
something portrait of okay no okay no no

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,450
we're not talking about the art cut we

00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,290
were talking about when you upload again

00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,970
the media in the media okay I would not

00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:03,410
worry too much about it in the media

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,610
it's like it's just not in the art tags

00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:11,270
okay the screen reader trying to read

00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:14,220
the arc tags it's not gonna read but

00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:18,020
what you upload in the media

00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:20,700
okay so you can continue not the name

00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:23,550
whatever whatever but when you go into

00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:28,520
the arc tag make sure that you're

00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,520
putting out the arc tag that make sense

00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,300
[Music]

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,320
okay

00:37:48,030 --> 00:38:01,640
I would hope that yeah okay and then

00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,830
nobody should be able to steal you're

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,480
right behind the thing about it is is if

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:10,220
they're gonna take a screenshot they're

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,220
not gonna use you're right

00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:31,400
okay so in the alt tag if I put

00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:39,080
something like image of promotional

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:45,950
poster for the name of the show produced

00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:49,610
by theater tickets available at the

00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:56,900
website something like that is that an

00:38:49,610 --> 00:39:02,000
acceptable kind of tag yeah poultra you

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:04,490
wanna stay image post explain that the

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,670
poker buddy a bet okay

00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:09,670
does that make things nobody get

00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:12,260
overcomplicated okay

00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:14,120
because I'm assuming I'm hoping that

00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:17,510
within the piece that you're describing

00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:19,550
that is in a bad doctor took us to stay

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,310
out or whatever and whatever that Amos

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:26,720
is you need to give a brief description

00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:29,510
of what that image that time keep in

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,600
mind that when a screen reader reading

00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:36,350
out loud to Brian Posehn that is going

00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:39,590
to describe what that I'm a but we

00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:43,760
have to be brief but don't overcome that

00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:48,410
I gave that rooster as a damper just

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:52,490
about the backup he gave three Tampa

00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:54,050
okay better and bash okay and the screen

00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,230
reader is going to read that in the our

00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:00,560
tab if either booster booster crowing or

00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:03,890
where Christ was requiring be fine

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,900
so what I was on appears whatever

00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:09,260
English was found up it yeah I know

00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:12,290
we're not used to that yeah that's why

00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,930
when one of my talk I talked about how

00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:17,300
do we think inclusively when we were

00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,100
dining with dykes we need to get into

00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,080
the habit of when we read on your

00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,579
website to start thinking inclusively

00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,650
from the get-go we need to

00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:28,859
create user personas in the beginning

00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:30,749
and add people with disabilities in the

00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:33,769
beginning so that when we go through the

00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:35,789
path that we start thinking that we're

00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:40,859
yeah I get to you

00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:43,940
yeah put them in like somebody talking

00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:43,940
on not caring you

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:54,890
is the odd but alt text it's already in

00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:57,020
this stock photo and when I said I

00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:02,480
bought the stock fell down when I put it

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:04,670
on my website isn't already there a

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:19,670
stock photo and the fact photo has

00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:26,780
archived in there and what does a

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:29,330
typical okay if they can take a quick

00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:32,270
photo should be fine but if it's a big

00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:49,520
re odd numbers or whatever you should be

00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:51,230
able to modify that no but I have to

00:41:49,520 --> 00:42:00,130

if we weren't that pleased to be found

00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:12,800
