Title: Tom Tortorici: The Art of Presenting Web Content
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	With the glut of information and competitors online, how will you engage busy buyers who have such short attention spans? Two ways: by using design to draw folks into the key messages on your website; and by crafting those messages to make a genuine connection.
We’ll look at a pile of before-and-after examples to explore some surprisingly simple ideas and insights that really can help your site stand out. The trick, as we’ll see, is to approach things from the buyer’s perspective instead of the seller’s perspective.

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,599
thank you Jason appreciate it

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,330
hi I'm Tom toda Ricci and having started

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,940
out as designer I love good design and

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,680
on their own sites designers talk about

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,140
how great website design will help a

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,970
company be successful and I'm sure

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,900
that's true but I'm also curious about

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,730
that because as a web buyer you know

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,210
looking at solutions from my own home or

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,340
business while I've been to plenty of

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,980
gorgeous websites where I didn't respond

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,350
or spend money on the other hand I have

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,930
bought stuff from ugly websites elevate

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,129
you up to so I thought about this and

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,440
thought about it probably more than that

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,840
was good for me and over the years

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,489
that's led to two things first whenever

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,770
I checked out companies for a product or

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,440
service I needed I started paying close

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,140
attention to what happened when my I

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,390
landed on the site what drew me in what

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,690
did I ignore what did I click and what

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,250
impressions was I left with second I

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,290
took what I had learned from oldest

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,720
observing and started integrating those

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,000
lessons in my work for web clients

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,090
whenever I started working on a seller

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,950
site I'd mentally put on my buyers had

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
and that totally changed how I

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,500
approached the field of web design of

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,530
course a sharp-looking web site can make

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,600
a first impression it can visually

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,880
convey that the company is professional

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,380
and contemporary a good looking site

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,520
could even help that company make the

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,130
buyer shortlist

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,409
but I found that by the end of the

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,090
journey that's not really the thing that

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,030
makes the ball you choose that company

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,250
as the one to do business with for most

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,579
business categories found that that's

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,130
the writing that does that compelling

00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:49,860
persuasive copy and content and the

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,810
strategy behind it so the way I've come

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,000
to think of it good design makes them

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,320
look and good content makes them think

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,079
you've ever heard the term content is

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,119
king raise your hand okay

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,369
put them down have you ever heard the

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:11,039
term color schemes our King no how about

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:13,709
security plugins our King no drop down

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,170
menus erkang nobody

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,969
I mean you know all these things are

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,859
essential for a modern fully functional

00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,230
website but then at the purpose of

00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:24,180
having a website in the first place

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,180
naturally companies need an online

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,579
presence to engage and inform their

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,049
buyers the point with some respond

00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:37,019
living to leads and sales now if your

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:39,359
website has beautiful images of say the

00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,280
jewelry or fashion items that you offer

00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,500
well it's really the pictures that are

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,079
doing the selling but in most other

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,299
cases when someone is responding to your

00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:50,159
site offering business services well

00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,590
once again it's because the words showed

00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,709
them it convinced them that your

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,239
approach might work for them if you're

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,799
selling Web Design of course your

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,049
portfolio is important to show

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,599
capability but that's just one page

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,790
throughout your site there's content and

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,040
there's design and they both have a role

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,739
to play but I find that there's a third

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,219
factor here and it's the place where

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,940
content and design overlap I call it

00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:20,489
content presentation it's about using

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,919
design not just for aesthetic appeal but

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,919
to intentionally draw the eye into all

00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,389
the essential messages on the page

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,639
because if folks don't read all that

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:33,900
those product benefits there's no reason

00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:36,299
to use that product right the thing is

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,250
those busy people today with short

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,019
attention spans are really just kind of

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,449
scanning websites instead of reading

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,909
every word and especially with the

00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,189
growing glut of information out there I

00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:48,810
think think it becomes more important

00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:53,310
than ever to capture people's attention

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,900
and get them to linger instead of bail

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,599
and I think some of this does happen

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,000
naturally in website design but as we'll

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,220
see there's a lot more you can do so

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,579
let's take a deeper dive into content

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,579
presentation

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,630
now me mostly these days I do strategic

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:14,160
copywriting for websites working for

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,010
companies or partnering with agencies

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,160
and designers may be the designer

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,350
included fresh content in the website

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,500
proposal or maybe they just got tired of

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,510
waiting for the clients supply it and

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,820
after a discovery and strategy phase I

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,620
try to organize and write the copy in a

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,980
way that indicates the emphasis

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,990
segmenting and sequences of messages as

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,430
a guide for pages that I like to think

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,680
of as optimized for humans also I found

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,420
that site owners even the designers

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,940
sometimes can be a little bit too close

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,010
to it to notice missed opportunities and

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,500
problems that are causing their visitors

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,630
to reach for the back button so I also

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,030
do consulting audits for existing sites

00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,910
to help uncover some of the on-page

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,980
issues that lead to low engagement and

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,940
conversion metrics and I'll share some

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,140
of those issues in just a minute you

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,610
know there's a common assumption these

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,010
days that people don't read

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,930
that's silly of course people read they

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,610
read what they want to read they just

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,980
might not read a certain website because

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,770
not enough was done visually to engage

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,990
their attention or maybe the words they

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,850
did see failed to connect what was

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,450
really important to them so let's look

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,800
at ways to turn that around the

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,620
approaches you'll see today will include

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,630
aspects of what's called UX or user

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,240
experience but here it's kind of a mash

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,430
up with marketing principles good UX

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,230
helps people accomplish something online

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,300
whereas good marketing shows them why

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,880
it's in their self-interest to pursue it

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,380
in the first place so carefully thought

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,940
through messaging isn't really as

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,190
important if you're doing a site for say

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,450
a public library but it is if you're

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,980
trying to convince people to buy your

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,750
books or anything else one other thing

00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,910
we tend to years to use the generic term

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,940
content for all the assets on a website

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,750
and even though even I use the terms

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,550
interchangeably

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,980
the phrase content writing really

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,540
applies more to things like

00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,970
informational blog posts whereas

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,100
copywriting refers more to the core

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,330
selling pages homepage product or

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,610
service pages so two different purposes

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,500
and even though the principal's today

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,599
are going to cover both they're probably

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,120
most crucial in structure in styling

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:30,500
core selling pages in an effort to get

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:33,139
people to engage and take action anyway

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,300
I have requests for the next half hour

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,639
or so I would like you all to forget

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,409
everything you know and everything

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:45,500
you've done and let's take a look at

00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:46,939
website design with fresh eyes first

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,680
we'll dig into some ideas for visual

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:54,530
engagement and some ideas for copying

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,969
gage Minh overall that core pages

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,979
especially home pages today a list

00:06:55,969 --> 00:07:02,150
likely to be read if they're one big

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:04,610
pile of plain text breaking the copy

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,599
into bright bite-sized segments makes it

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:10,759
friendlier and more inviting to the eye

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,379
before and after and that's important

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,569
because people will read a key message

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,029
if it's visually prominent enough and

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:20,389
can be taken in what I call a single eye

00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:22,490
gulp okay on the other hand you may

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,979
mention a smart game change changing

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,060
product benefit but if it's buried in

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,460
the third sentence of the fourth

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,129
paragraph might as well not be there at

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,210
all

00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:34,819
plenty of product and service pages

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,990
still use mostly a plain text format but

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:41,180
by combining those two a more of a home

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,339
page format a segmented series of blocks

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,960
well that lets the visitors snack on

00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:48,409
bits of content without committing to a

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,909
meal also we remember to keep you most

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,310
important messages near the top of the

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:59,289
page because sadly folks don't always

00:07:52,310 --> 00:08:02,300
make it to the bottom this one's easy

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,909
one of the main uses of images and icons

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,610
to catch the eye and deliver it to are

00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:09,469
key messages people do notice images

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,779
first but generally spend very little

00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:15,219
time on them so give the engaged eye

00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,219
some place to go next

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,340
we carefully arrange our menus and

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,010
submenus and and but in the real world

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,260
really only our most motivated visitors

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,900
are clicking away on all those tiny menu

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,789
links according to analytics averages

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,349
most folks don't stray too far from the

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,669
page they initially landed on its way

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,580
it's important especially on the home

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,950
page to also include prominent links

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,540
with bits of teaser copy to the most

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:56,510
important pages you'll want people to

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:57,980
say entice them make them curious and I

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,660
think you'll see more page views per

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:04,640
visit also if you provide different

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,770
services or serve more than one princess

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,350
category list them right on your home

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,420
page and not just in a drop-down people

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,460
will quickly see that you do accounting

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,280
for construction companies accounting

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,650
for engineering companies and so on and

00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,660
they can then click through the pages

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:27,140
where you will address their individual

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:30,500
issues here is a headline that starts at

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,480
the edge of the page and here's that

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,520
same headline that starts closer to the

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,160
pages visual centre of gravity with a

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,990
little more air around it as your eye

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,970
naturally scans its way down the page

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,410
which headline are you more likely to

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:48,350
read and which one are you more likely

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:50,630
to miss do you see that so good design

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,000
isn't just about arranging elements to

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,970
fit on a page it's also about synching

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,710
with the scanning eyes natural patterns

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,680
okay maybe walk away from your page

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:04,450
design and come back later and look at

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,450
it or wearing your buyers hat

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,200
you know it turns out that there's an

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,020
enormous gulf between the last word of a

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,430
headline and the first word of text a

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,140
lot more people are reading that

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,870
headline than reading the text and

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,890
that's so sad to me but I fight back and

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,900
my weapon is the subhead the secondary

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,300
headline kind of acts like a bridge or a

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,760
visual funnel gently guiding the eye in

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,400
deeper again make your hips up heads

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,530
enticing suggesting that the ideas to

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,690
come we'll solve a need resolve an

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,690
objection or give that visitor an edge

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,800
for blog posts and other long-form

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,650
content we still have to overcome the

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,020
visitors subconscious tendency to go I'm

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,120
not gonna read a lot you've done that a

00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:02,000
million times maybe a million and a

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:04,070
quarter people are more likely to read

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,800
text in a narrower column versus a

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:11,540
full-width column of course people are

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,450
more likely to read text in a larger

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:19,760
font size than a smaller font size

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:22,130
of course people more likely to read

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,550
text with increased line spacing versus

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,290
tight spacing of course these simple

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,839
tweaks just make it easy to read and

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:34,700
therefore more accessible and inviting

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:37,460
to the eye now one way to make long text

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,560
a little less scary is to insert bold

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,480
section headers say every two paragraphs

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,220
and of course you'll use those headers

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,550
to intrigue readers with you juiciest

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,140
most helpful benefits key paragraph

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,440
short no more than two or three

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,440
sentences

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,670
[Laughter]

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,480
or you can you can make the first few

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,550
words of alternating paragraphs bold to

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,210
draw that scanning eye into the content

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,460
okay

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:24,770
I mean boldly dense is so easy to do and

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:27,470
really do make a difference if your

00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,240
first paragraph introduces the main

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,130
points of your topic turn it into a

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:36,920
prominent intro to help jump-start the

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:38,720
readers attention or pull the brightest

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,820
bits of wisdom from your text and

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,980
feature them prominently as pull quotes

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,900
and these helpful quotes about solving

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,160
the customers problem can also be

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:51,020
presented as quotes from the staff so

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,780
those impatient scanners right there

00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:56,690
might just read the pull quotes are just

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,700
the section headers or whatever the two

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,160
purposes here is to make sure they don't

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,080
walk away with that at least be exposed

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,800
to the main messages you want to convey

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,570
and to having headers or intros that

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,400
point to such interesting possibilities

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:18,790
that some of those scanners become

00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:21,950
curious enough to turn into readers so

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,050
look at the top one look at the bottom

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,420
one we make the decision of whether or

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,420
not to read something in an instant

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,430
thoughts questions and other ideas

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:55,260
just placeholder text all right

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,780
okay I'm gonna whip Micah's which

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:36,990
can you hear me all right well let's

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:42,000
hope like this okay no really I love

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:43,730
technology I love technology okay where

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,090
was I

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:50,340
okay also some companies respond to a

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,850
dwindling literacy by having an absolute

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,040
minimum of copy on their site on one

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,070
hand concise writing with that fluff is

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,310
good content presentation but don't

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:04,890
eliminate secondary information or

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,470
points that might be helpful to the

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:10,560
engaged reader who wants to dig a little

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:13,260
further or needs more convincing okay

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,460
the solution might be a low-density

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:20,340
topic page that links to more detailed

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:22,680
subtopic pages right or you could put

00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:26,430
longer chunks of copy towards the bottom

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,250
of your page which also helps increase

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,900
word count for SEO purposes but either

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:36,990
way the visitor chooses of their own

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:38,970
journey so of course it's not just

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,010
design tweaks that draw the scanning eye

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,620
into the content it's the content itself

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,210
for example when I'm skimming a site an

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,250
intriguing headline that cuts to the

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,530
heart of my issue is gonna make me

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,000
mentally lean forward but if those

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,310
headlines are filled with the company's

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,470
vague self-serve serving claims in

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,480
boasts my mouth starts inching towards

00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,480
the back button sometimes all by itself

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,970
vote I mean photos charts and graphs are

00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,670
absolutely good ideas to help break up

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,760
the text and get keep people reading and

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,630
and scrolling so yes good point

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,630
we're good

00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,160
so you've seen these superficial

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,230
marketing cliches that reflect the

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,140
inside a point of view of company

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,100
employees okay they use the words we an

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,100
hour away too much

00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,420
so instead dig down to find the one

00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,580
thing that the company offers that makes

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,370
it unique in this case 24 hour on call

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,640
service then approach that as a benefit

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,760
from what it means to the customer okay

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,590
when they see that the company truly

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,750
understands not only their needs but

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,060
their also their frustrations well it

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,870
kind of creates a sense of trust and

00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Trust is the prerequisite for a sale

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:16,060
notice how we has been replaced by you

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:28,310
in his insightful book building a story

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,360
brand how many people are familiar Bao

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,310
Miller okay

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,810
he says figure out your customers story

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,150
and place yourself smack in the middle

00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,310
of it he says too many companies try to

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,070
be the hero whereas they should position

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,470
themselves as the guide that helps the

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,690
customer become the hero okay

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,810
yes people do care about the company's

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:55,520
story this much but they care about

00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:57,860
their own story this much big

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,920
unsupported promises that we often often

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,930
see in headlines and quickly tune out

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:10,460
are never as impactful as specific

00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:12,380
competitive benefits and yes we do have

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,960
to quickly let visitors know what it is

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,580
we do but on so many home pages sadly

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,010
that's all they accomplished because

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,750
they didn't be kept enough to find a

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:26,420
meaningful advantage to stand out from

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:28,370
the pack so here's what a company might

00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,700
want to say about its product let's try

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,700
a different approach

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,750
okay so you men just don't really make

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,540
decisions based on an emotional reaction

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,190
so let's help that visitor imagine help

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,710
them feel like they're already there

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,870
okay so same image but with a more

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,240
visceral copy approach and relevant

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,490
supporting points you don't have to sell

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,350
so hard if you simply put your product

00:18:51,490 --> 00:19:00,820
in the middle of the customers story

00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:04,740
right bullet points can be useful but

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,740
not all bullet points are created equal

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,780
okay so choose the strongest one and

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,640
make that your header in the second

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,140
example we're giving getting across

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,960
something valuable to the scanning

00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,650
reader in the top example we're wasting

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,650
that opportunity

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,399
okay we need to include an a prominent

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,320
call-to-action button we know that but

00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:34,720
if we put on our buyers hat will realize

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:42,519
that folks are more likely to click on

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:44,080
it if you give them a reason so tempt

00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,870
them with an appeal that works on a

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:52,029
logical level an emotional level

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:54,039
preferably both second very important

00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:55,450
folks are more likely to take action if

00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:59,169
they know what's going to happen after

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:02,760
they respond okay knowing the plan

00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:05,679
raises their confidence and lowers the

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,889
risky sense of the unknown in fact it's

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,320
often not a bad idea to include a how it

00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:13,600
works section on your website so that

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,279
they they can get a preview of what to

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,279
expect that makes sense

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,389
also consider having to call to action

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,909
buttons say one button to get in touch

00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,980
with folks who are closer to purchasing

00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:29,590
and one button for downloading say a

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,919
helpful ebook for people who won the

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:36,240
earlier stages of the buying process

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,240
have a path for both types of visitor

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,620
the first few words of text you're

00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,990
opening will determine whether people

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,850
are going to read further if your

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,920
opening is a vague and obvious statement

00:20:52,850 --> 00:21:02,870
they'll figure rest of its out begging

00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:05,180
obvious so why read it but if you're

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,790
opening takes them by surprise if it

00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,990
immediately connects on a visceral level

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,330
they'll need to read on to see if this

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,190
is something they need to know about

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,030
Plus remember humans are more likely to

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:26,660
be engaged and take action when they're

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:28,670
emotionally engaged okay let's take a

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:37,300
look at these tell me what the

00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:37,300
difference is between them anybody

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:55,429
look at the three messages okay all

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:57,230
right but if you notice also there are

00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:58,820
three different messages that get it go

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,470
in three different directions in the

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,150
bottom one okay so the point here is uh

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,890
with all the points and messages on your

00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,550
website how will people know which are

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:12,710
the most important try repetition with

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,040
variations throughout your site to drill

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,270
a drive home you main value proposition

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,160
we tend to remember something that's

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:22,040
repeated versus something that just

00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,770
mentioned once okay being so strongly

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,550
associated with that one important point

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,980
can help you be the one vendor that

00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:33,230
online searchers actually remember okay

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,590
so back in grade school how did you

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:38,870
learn your alphabet repetition right so

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,860
however many years that spin raise your

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:45,550
hand if you don't remember your alphabet

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,550
okay where's my point

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,070
again we need to let Pope people know

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,279
what it is we offer but instead of just

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,409
listing our deliverables try presenting

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,090
them in terms of real world benefit for

00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:10,279
the buyer and maybe add the surface

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:13,720
itself as a subhead so look at the

00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,720
difference between these two approaches

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,740
so notice in the top one the company is

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,660
trying to be the hero a wiser approach

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,450
makes the home owner of the hero for

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:44,120
successfully replacing their on problem

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:47,000
with an achievement this make sense so

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,040
good marketing translates the processes

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,230
from the company's perspective to the

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,360
customers perspective and this is what

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,990
way too many sites out there battle to

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,080
do against this most business websites

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,520
pretty much just talk about what they do

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,220
most sites in the given category pretty

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,380
much sound the same and that's not very

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,430
helpful for the online buyer who's

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,430
trying to make a choice

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,759
top headline does get across a benefit

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,519
but posing it as a question makes people

00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,169
curious and draws them in Plus and the

00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,850
second one makes clear who this is for

00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:31,850
and that's always smart to include

00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:48,080
what's the difference between these

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:50,029
shorter right also try to try to avoid

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,190
using the word customer or client or

00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:53,509
patient they're really just customers

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,899
from the point of view of company

00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:58,940
employees so just use the word you as

00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:01,789
you would in conversation and the bottom

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,320
one there's an implied you and the of

00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:05,149
lesson here of course is if you can find

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,399
a shorter way to say it then your

00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:11,109
website visitors especially the lazy

00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:11,109
ones are more likely to read it

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,809
okay the top one you might see from

00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:26,720
creatives who prefer to take a more

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:30,200
personal authentication siddur Zayn type

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,279
of promotional language turn-off and I

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,759
get that and it's certainly something

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,200
appealing about it but from the buyers

00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,779
perspective there's really no room for

00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,080
them in that top story in the bottom one

00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,669
there is it gets across the designers

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,409
passion for helping

00:25:43,669 --> 00:26:00,649
but maybe without using the word

00:25:45,409 --> 00:26:03,259
everyone else that uses although blog

00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:05,119
posts are meant to offer useful wisdom I

00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,220
think it's cool to add a beefed brief

00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,200
promotional blurb somewhere that helps

00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:13,220
the buyer along on the next step of

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,720
their journey with a link and just as

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,190
it's okay to add a little marketing to

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:22,759
our wisdom maybe we can add a little

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:24,799
wisdom to our marketing on product pages

00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,749
I'd like to add some brief related tip

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,330
or insight that helps the customers

00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:30,919
solve their issue and this is important

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,340
because if we saw if we position

00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:35,659
ourselves as a resource serving that

00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,429
person right up front

00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:39,889
well we're planting the seeds for a

00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:42,349
relationship instead of just focusing

00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:51,429
inward on how we see our company's

00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:53,509
mission all the before and after

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:55,940
examples we just looked at they're all

00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:57,979
doable they're free they don't require

00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,809
configuring a plugin and you can start

00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:02,029
using them tomorrow to tweak and improve

00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,379
your site or at least know enough to

00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:06,349
work with someone who can complete the

00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:08,269
improvements and remember when you're

00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:10,639
developing a new website it makes more

00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:13,070
sense to start with a copy and then

00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:16,639
build build the design around that

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:19,039
because because the risks there instead

00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:20,509
of pre building the pages and you know

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,669
trying to fit in the copy because the

00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:25,070
risk there is squeezing the messages to

00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:28,249
fit some arbitrary template or layout

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:30,590
instead of arranging them to fit what

00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:35,470
that visitor needs to see on her laptop

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,470
in her kitchen with her credit card out

00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,570
so don't forget when viewers eye lanes

00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,670
on your page that's your first

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,940
opportunity to grab those eyeballs and

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:47,440
put them in your pocket so to speak be

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,080
sure the first thing they see is

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,120
something that matters to them in fact

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,030
think about this simple formula make the

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:58,840
headline about the buyer and the subhead

00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:04,510
about the seller head head head line

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,950
buyer sub head seller in fact the more

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,350
you know about your customer and what's

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,000
important to them the more you can use

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,130
that to approach everything on a

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,980
business website as an opportunity to

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,130
connect if you have a video on your home

00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,560
page just saying watch our video throws

00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,050
away that opportunity because if you

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:28,660
don't make it sound interesting unique

00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:30,100
and truly helpful why would they and

00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,870
that's often a problem when company

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,420
insiders try to write their own web copy

00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,490
I mean they know their company but in

00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,350
fact they're so close to it that their

00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,630
words tend to appeal to other company

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,840
insiders with something to sell or

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:47,410
rather than real world buyers with an

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,990
issue to solve company managers

00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,120
employees also tend to copy the same

00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:55,480
worn-out phrases of their competitors

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,820
which makes them feel safe but that's no

00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,560
way to present yourself in a competitive

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:05,020
environment right on the other hand a

00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,640
thoughtful discovery process with an

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,850
outside consultant a writer can help

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,710
this kind of stand back and get a wider

00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,680
view of what it is we bring to people's

00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:19,540
lives and also look closely to get a

00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:22,200
genuine or genuine chance to you know to

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,100
make a more memorable connection than

00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,690
competitors who are just yakking about

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:30,040
what they think about themselves okay

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:32,230
now if web designers can create

00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,990
sharp-looking websites with powerful

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,480
copy points that grab and keep people's

00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,840
interest then deliverable is not just

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,070
visual website design and implementation

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,590
it becomes a strategic marketing

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,670
solution that fulfills with that company

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,670
actually needed in the first place

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,890
in fact for the web designers here let's

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,900
remember you're not in the design

00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,090
business not really you're in the

00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,680
marketing business because in the end

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,930
it's not about getting people to fall in

00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,160
love with the website it's about getting

00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:06,570
people to fall in love with the product

00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:09,120
so if you remember anything at all today

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,940
we'll remember this if you're working on

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,510
a seller's website whose hat should you

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,390
be wearing the buyers hat of course and

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:22,230
that will make it easier to not forget

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:24,690
what's important here so if you want to

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:28,050
