stuff that I'm giving you today is stuff

00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,390
that I use on my personal business - my

00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,160
master financial spreadsheet templates

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,819
all with formulas that are going to Auto

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,790

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,530
template so when you want to find that

00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:48,310
dream client here's a way for you to

find them and track them you're on it I

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,489
don't control the speaker okay sorry

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,989
I'll try to speak up alright so some

00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:57,970
rules this is not a push-button

00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,349
technique right so it's gonna take some

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,290
hard work it's going to take some

00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,329
self-discovery right so it's gonna take

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,959
at least an hour or two of your day over

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,730
a week period of time for you to

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,379
implement this formula into your

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,359
business and this is only going to help

00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:15,670
you if your skillset or your service

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,620
actually helps people on the other end

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,750
right so this is not for the mediocre

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,230
right so if your mediocre at your skill

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,239
set

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,450
you know kudos to you let's keep

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,790
learning but this is not for you so this

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,650
is for hustlers and people who are sharp

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,630
at their craft

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,859
so does this sound familiar Mike you're

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,260
generating leads but you're not getting

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:37,720
any sales so almost everybody you talk

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:42,370
to they want to haggle on that price and

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,500
or you get a payment you're excited to

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,620
get started but you find out you've just

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,329
been hired by the client from hell right

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,799
right or they're just so slow to bring

00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,120
in that money right the cheques always

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,650
in the mail right right or PayPal's down

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,940
right like the mcdonald shake machine

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:06,669
it's always down alright or you'd rather

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,019
cut off that right arm again because you

00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,349
don't want to write a sales page so does

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:13,750
any of this sound familiar good

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,040
so the actual problem what you've been

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,139
doing isn't working because it's based

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,479
on flawed principles and have some notes

00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,400
here so you're not focusing on that

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,830
expensive problem and how you can be an

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,889
out how you can be a true asset to your

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,719
client

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,729
and I'm gonna I'm not just talking about

00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:30,469
that drink the dream client that just

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:31,939
pays on time right it's deeper than

00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:35,120
payment right it's deeper than money

00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:37,580
working with that dream client you know

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,740
both of your goals aligned right it's a

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,650
project that you want to work on so

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,650
that's what I consider that dream client

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,199
so there's six pillars so these are

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,580
things that you need to these are six

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,710
things you need to get clear on right so

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,150
today I'm going to walk you through how

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,460
I completely changed the way that I

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,080
positioned myself and how I sell my

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,430
products and services today so

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,750
everything that I'm teaching your day is

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,419
something I've been using for the past

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,400
few years so to make this work there's

00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,939
six critical steps and I want to walk

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,900
you through that anybody ready to rock

00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:14,509

you right not only that but I want to

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,529
help you raise a family

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:51,469
so hashtag blessed so just ten years ago

00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:54,080
my business my solo business was just

00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:57,110
full of complication right so many

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,529
moving parts full of complication I was

00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,750
busy

00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,370
selling my skills for peanuts right so I

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,289
was creating websites for Joe the

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,060
Plumber right he thought his 20 dollars

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,490
was worth a hundred dollars right is

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,469
everybody familiar with that so I was

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,719
performing a skill set extremely high

00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:14,689
value skill set but didn't know how to

00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:16,250
charge more for it so or I didn't even

00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,839
know how to find the people that would

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,000
charge the amount of money that I needed

00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,849
to charge to really make it profitable

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,029
so as a result I was a highly effective

00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,409
developer slash marketer and I was you

00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:29,839
know really making peanuts right I was

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:32,509
barely eating ramen noodles even though

00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:36,110
I was getting people big results on the

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,879
other end so my light bulb moment I read

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,490
two books ten years ago one

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:43,789
the 22 immutable laws of marketing

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,159
number two duct tape marketing so these

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,729
two books showed me what I was doing

00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,830
wrong

00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:52,819
I was marketing myself as a generalist

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,619
and as enough as a commodity so I'm sure

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,469
you're familiar with the job boards it

00:06:54,619 --> 00:07:00,379
used to be Oh desk now it's upwork alas

00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:02,240
freelancer etc I was on those job boards

00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,539
right you're a commodity because it's

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,879
only your your avatar or your profile

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:09,919
picture a little mumbo jumbo right here

00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,689
about who you are and a rating either a

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,819
thumb up a thumb down or a five-star

00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:15,949
right so now you're a commodity and I

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:20,089
was marketing myself as a commodity

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:23,599
instead of a specialist so that's what I

00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:25,519
was doing wrong so what do things look

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,559
like now for me I do have a successful

00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,539
business so I help people get rid of

00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:31,879
their headaches or their expensive

00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:35,599
problems I make a good living of that so

00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,759
shouts out to Matt Mullenweg right and

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,830
shouts out to everybody who makes

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,939
WordPress possible because you've helped

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:46,159
me pay mortgages car notes and set up a

00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,990
retirement account so I've worked with

00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:50,300
over two hundred really really great

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,339
clients in the past ten years and even

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,240
though I specialize it's not been a

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,819
death sentence

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,529
I still get work from other types of

00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,899
businesses and other business John Rizzo

00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,550
so just because you specialize in one

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:03,529
area doesn't mean as a death sentence

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,800
for your business you're going to get

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:09,139
work from other places so I call this my

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,149
purple unicorn strategy my daughter

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:14,149
Adeline likes unicorns and she likes

00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:16,519
anything with the color purple so I call

00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:19,599
this my purple unicorn strategy so

00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:22,459
here's an outline or an overview of that

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,949
and we're going to break down and dive

00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:28,999
deep into all six critical steps here

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:32,479
I'm sorry everybody needs to take a

00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:34,189
picture okay yeah go ahead right so

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,659
these are things these are six critical

00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:38,479
things that you need to get clear on and

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,819
so once I got clear on this I was I was

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,709
just it's like I was stumbling onto my

00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:44,269
dream client and I was stumbling onto

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:47,300
these people that wanted to pay me a lot

00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:48,980
of money right but again I had to put in

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,600
a lot of work a lot of self-reflection

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,610
on who I

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,189
what about what I want out of my

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:59,209
business and what I want out of clients

00:08:55,189 --> 00:09:01,309
so it's not easy so pillar one you

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,470
always want to go three layers deep on

00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:05,389
who you seek to serve you want to get

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,329
really specific and here's an example I

00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:10,189
want to work with marketing directors or

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:12,439
slash managers in the medical device

00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:14,149
industry who are looking to increase

00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:16,970
their patient outreach programs

00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:18,800
that's super specific right but again

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,689
it's not a death sentence I'm still

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,199
going to work with other types of

00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:26,600
businesses but this helps me raise my

00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:29,300
rates because this is very specific it's

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,389
a very specific problem that this type

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,399
of client has we're gonna hold our

00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:36,139
questions till the end yeah so make sure

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,879
you hold your questions to the end and

00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:42,709
I'll make sure to answer them so here's

00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,050
a formula right so from Jonathan Stark

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,399
if anybody's in not gameofthrones right

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,069
he's just he's a real dude named

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,800
Jonathan Stark you can find him at

00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:53,689
Jonathan Stark calm really great guy

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,799
he's a software developer but he's a

00:09:53,689 --> 00:10:00,980
pricing authority slash expert in

00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:04,759
pricing solopreneurs in the development

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,459
space so check him out right but he has

00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:11,209
a formula which helped me get clear and

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:14,119
so I am a discipline who helps target

00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:15,740
market with expensive problem unlike my

00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:18,379
competitors and here's a unique

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,470
difference and so here's an example of

00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:24,139
that I'm a web developer or web designer

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,819
who helps fortune 500 retailers with

00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,679
abandoned shopping carts on their

00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,319
e-commerce sites and unlike my

00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,449
competitors I use a bee split-testing to

00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:34,639
focus on the bottom line instead of

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:38,929
wasting my time with arbitrary design

00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,689
changes so that helps you stand out from

00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:44,209
the crowd right it helps you stand out

00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:45,589
from you know all the other people in

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,160
the marketplace and it gets really

00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:51,259
specific right I mean just this you can

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,579
charge 10 grand alone just for that that

00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:57,470
statement so pillar 2 what problem do

00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,179
you want to help them with right so they

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,249
got 99 problems you just got to choose

00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:02,839
one of them right so just make sure you

00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,370
choose one problem and make sure that

00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,920
that's the next

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,339
pensive problem that way you can raise

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,880
your rates right so you want to help

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:15,490
them with something really expensive and

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,710
the exact ways that you want to help

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,290
them with that right so what are the

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,420
three to five to seven to ten to twelve

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,339
what are the listicle ways that you can

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,870
help them with that expensive problem

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,440
right so these are the features and

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,240
benefits right so the idea here is to

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,810
create a product tie service with a

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,150
fairly limited scope a fixed price and a

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,740
fixed delivery deadline right so that

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,290
way you can create a repeatable process

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,839
that you can execute on over and over

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:47,290
again and you're confident that you can

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,770
quote them on price so I specialize in

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,800
PSD to WordPress and my white space or

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,200
my pocket is quoting people over the

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,170
phone I have a fairly limited scope in a

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,270
fixed price so unlike my competitors who

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,550
have to quote you right well it depends

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,560
can you send me the PSD I need to quote

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,420
you I'm gonna give you a flat rate price

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,860
right there on the phone and nine times

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,209
out of ten I'm getting started by the

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,029
end of the day because I've already

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:15,310
gotten a payment through fresh books so

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:18,430
find that pocket find that white space

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:22,029
and figure out that limited scope with

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:25,000
that fixed price so when can they expect

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:28,779
the result so every business runs on

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,830
time time is money and any down website

00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,690
cost them money correct so you want to

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,760
define when are they going to expect

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,880
this result that specific business

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,240
result right and so when I speak about

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,070
the specific result so when clients give

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,800
you a testimonial they're not going to

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,170
say well that was beautiful code right

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,630
they're gonna say my website helps

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,950
increase calls to my sales department

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,900
right so that's the type of stuff

00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:00,010
they're going to say and that's the type

00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:02,050
of business outcome that you want what's

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,990
it going to cost to get that result so

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:08,550
again notice I said results and limit

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,550
your scope instead of fixed price

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:14,300
exactly how are you going to deliver

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,980
this help right so traditionally you

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,440
might set up a staging site or a

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,540
development environment and then migrate

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,100
that over right are you going to zip it

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,920
up and send it to them are you going to

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,510
send them a flash drive or gonna are you

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,190
going to mail it off via Pony Express

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,350
how are you going to deliver this help

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,020
you want to get really really clear on

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,770
how and when you're going to deliver

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:40,600
this help so that's the last step in

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:43,490
these critical purple unicorn strategy

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,840
so here's an overview of that again if

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,720
you missed the picture the first time

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,750
you can get another picture but that is

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,550
the purple unicorn strategy and again

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,550
these are six critical steps that are

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,580
going to get you clear on who you seek

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:02,000
to serve and how you serve them and how

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,550
much you're going to get paid so now

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,840
we're going to go on to a basic very

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:12,800
basic sales page formula so here's my

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,830
easy sales page formula right so this is

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,330
a is an overview again I do have another

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,920
overview so in case you miss this

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,920
picture you can get another picture

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,120
so the first part of this sales page is

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
the pain you want to lead with the

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,330
problem you want to lead with the

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,130
frustration right so like I said it's is

00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,050
you know referred to as a problem

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,570
section or the headache section right

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,150
and it's literally just you describing

00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,460
that pain that your ideal customer is

00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:53,030
facing right you're explaining how

00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:56,270
frustrating it is for them and so if we

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:58,280
were using an umbrella or a rain analogy

00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:02,140
right you're cold and wet out in the

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:06,530
rain and that seems pretty frustrating

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:08,480
so the drink right so in this section

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,760
you present the reader with a mirror

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,540
image of the pain right sticking with

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:19,130
the rain example a dream would be your

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:21,830
warm and dry but notice I didn't explain

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:29,330
how they got from cold and wet to warm

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:32,540
and dry cows way right so the fix this

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:36,200
is also the offer section right so you

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,910
want them so when you're in that dream

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,580
section you you just want them to

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,680
picture you know their ideal scenario

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,600
right which is that business outcome on

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,880
the other end but now you're going to go

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,800
into the fix right and this is where

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:55,090
you're explaining how you're going to

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:57,560
fix that right so and in the umbrella

00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,900
scenario or the rain scenario we're

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,060
talking about they could get inside of a

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,970
taxi they can get into the breezeway

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,930
or a hallway they can get a raincoat a

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:13,220
poncho a hat or an umbrella right so

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:15,680
that's the fix to their solution so the

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,260
first call to action so make sure that

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,450
you have some sort of specific purpose

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,730
right so you can only move people along

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:25,700
one step at the time in your sales

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,880
process right so you can't ask them to

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,350
do six or seven things on one page make

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,690
sure you're asking them to do one

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,570
specific thing is that to schedule a

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,220
sales call with you is that to fill out

00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,280
your multi step nine

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,680
page form or you know whatever it may be

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,830
or to download some sort of content

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,200
upgrade isn't a checklist is it a PDF is

00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,960
it a presentation you know whatever it

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,640
may be make sure that it's one step one

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,740
call-to-action and make sure that call

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,610
to action is consistent throughout your

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,670
page so social proof which are called

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,620
trust signals so if people have been

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:07,410
leaving you Facebook messages take a

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,960
screenshot of that Facebook message and

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,140
you can now embed that on your site if

00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,270
people send you a tweet and they think

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,330
your service is awesome screencap that

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:21,060
embed that right or if you have Google

00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:23,070
my business reviews embed those as well

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,900
or Facebook review it wherever you're

00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,750
getting your reviews and however you're

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,090
getting them so FreshBooks has a built

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,270
in review system so when you send an

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,880
invoice off they pay the invoice it asks

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,260
them for review or testimonial and of

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,330
course that gets emailed right to you

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,060
you can screen cap that and then put

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:45,480
that on your sales page so you just the

00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,220
point is you want other people telling

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,260
you how awesome you are you don't want

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,660
to tell yourself how awesome you are

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:56,700
right so you want other people to

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,440
believe that so any objections right I'm

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,390
sure we all get the same type of stuff

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,020
like why are you so expensive right or

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,730
why is your price so high or how are you

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,250
going to deliver this or or how are you

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,200
you know how do you work or how do I pay

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,970
etc so there's some there's some common

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,180
objections there's some common questions

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,550
you want to have an FAQ section in your

00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,060
sales page right so this is going to

00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:23,010
educate the person aunt that's viewing

00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,040
your page before they even talk to you

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,410
over the phone so that way you've

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,900
eliminated that education portion of

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,670
your 15 minute or your 30 minute call

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,210
and now you get right to the business

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:39,930
and asking them you know you know all

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,460
about their project and then here's what

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,830
makes you unique you want to make sure

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,870
that you put something on your page that

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,210
makes you stand out from the rest and

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,530
make sure unique if not you're just a

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,300
commodity and you look just like

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,680
everyone else

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,950
they're going to go down the street and

00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,930
hire the other person your second

00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,550
call-to-action again it has to be

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,570
consistent with the first call to action

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,170
and make sure it's just one step

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,500
schedule a call

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:09,870
so through calendly or vc2 or you know

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,250
however you booked your calls it can be

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,400
through there or again it can be your

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,650
form or content upgrade however you want

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,480
it to be but just make sure that your

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,520
second call to action is consistent with

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,020
your first call to action or it can just

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,030
be an anchor link that takes them back

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,970
up to the first call to action however

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,700
you want to work that and then urgency

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,680
sprinkle in a little urgency right

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,540
I only take on one one new client a

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,370
month you better hurry up right so

00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,940
limited supply even though it's all

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:42,060
digital right the first ten people etc

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,300
right sprinkle in some urgency to get

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:49,320
them to at least book that call or take

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:52,040
that for that call to action step and

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:56,340
again that's the overview of the easy

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,770
sales page formula and so I urge you to

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,840
just pull up like a Google document or a

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,720
word document whatever your text editor

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,910
is right pull that up and just put all

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,670
the text in your text editor don't worry

00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,950
about designing a fancy sales page right

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:14,340
now just put all the words in a document

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,860
and then worry later about laying it out

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,780
and looking fancy right don't get fancy

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,790
upfront just put it into document or

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,650
write it on a cocktail napkin if you

00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:25,470
want to write just make sure you just

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,480
get the words down and then sleep on it

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,340
let it breathe overnight come back to it

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,940
again right and so that's really

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,920
important because this is going to be

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,440

00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:06,630

problem so make sure you go that three

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:29,860
layers deep into bat an odd I just I was

like throwing spaghetti at the wall in

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,290
the beginning so I just learned it over

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,260
time I learned who I like to work with

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:48,340
over time so it in the beginning it was

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:52,260
it was I was just doing everything oh so

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,910
I actively pursue projects or clients so

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,980

managers and marketing directors you

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,950
have to actively pursue them so I go to

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,960
trade shows and conferences in that

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,120
particular niche so like the medical

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,020
device industry I will attend a medical

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,400
device conference either by invite of a

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,679
current company I'm working with or I'll

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,340
just pay to go and I will actively

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,900
pursue targets so I'm reaching out in

00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,730
advance

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,860
or I'm researching in advance via

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:28,150
LinkedIn to find out who the marketing

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:33,100
managers with the big boosts and the

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:35,380
sort of medium boosts there and I'm

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,870
approaching them right so I'm trying so

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,700
in my research process I'm finding out

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,500
do they like alcohol or do they like

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,620
coffee do they like steak or they like

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,270
burgers and then I'll invite them out

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,550
for dinner or drinks

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:52,840
of course that's all expensable right

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:54,580
and I try to walk away with $50,000 or

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,120
more leads from any trade show or

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,120
conference

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,810
can you show us your home page or an

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,730
example of a like something that kind of

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,490
shows what you've just talked about like

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,680
there's a good example of that statement

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:17,490
I mean because wicked what you're

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:19,650
calling on a sales page no it would be a

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,020
it would be a sales page for a specific

00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,720
service so your home page is completely

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,410
different your home page is your

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,440
receptionist right

00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,750
that's your admin pointing people in the

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,940
right direction throughout your site but

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,190
your sales page that's a deep link

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,100
inside of your website so let's say for

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:41,610
your web design services right so your

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,660
home page slash web design and it's a

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:48,450
it's a specific page built and created

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,910
specifically to sell that service so if

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,580
it's PSD to WordPress it's specifically

00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:58,830
for PSD to WordPress does that make

00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:01,110
sense okay you can call it a landing

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,510
page or a sales page right yeah it's the

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:07,290
same principle some people call it

00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:10,740
squeeze pages landing pages sales pages

00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:13,440
yeah yeah the you know the the object

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,690
the object objective is to get them to

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,300
take one action on the page right

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,720
whatever that action is for you and your

00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,720
business

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,150
we got we got a whole 30 minutes people

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:37,090
the last page on there

00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:37,090
that's a union

00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:49,649
yes so the so a general overview of the

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,840
freelancers Union so we help with

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:57,990
freelancers advocacy so non-payment

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:02,190
insurance benefits retirement accounts

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:04,049
right so we have IRAs and it's all at no

00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,730
cost right so it's just partners that

00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:08,159
are vetted through the freelancers Union

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,620
and so that's what the freelancers Union

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,750
is all about is advocating for your

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,320
rights as an independent worker or /

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,320
freelancer

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:34,060
yeah so there have been well there's

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:38,000
been movements for freelance isn't free

00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,840
to help with non-payment that's but

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,110
that's not what you're talking about

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,110
right

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:24,610
got it got it yeah right got it got it

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:27,320
right so I have a have something right

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,550
so I have something very similar in one

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,730
of the sheets that I give you on the

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,770
freebies page there's a paycheck divider

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,950
worksheet inside of the entire workbook

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,480
so the master financial spreadsheet

00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,340
there's several workbooks and one of

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,080
them is a paycheck divider and it's

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,210
doing what you're talking about so if

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,740
you have separate bank accounts you can

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,100
take a percentage of that and you know

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,630
you enter in your income on one

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,520
worksheet and it's going to

00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:55,100
automatically divide that paycheck or

00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,260
that payment and that's how I handle my

00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,820
books it's an Excel spreadsheet yeah

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,760
yeah I'm still I'm still old school I

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,810
just I don't do fancy software except

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:09,190
for fresh books yeah my crm is actually

00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,190
a spreadsheet yeah

00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:24,590
do you still get pushback sometimes

00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:26,150
involved in how you handle that so there

00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,970
are times I get pushback you know that

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:31,220
you know why are you so expensive or and

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:35,360
so I'm handling a specific problem and

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,100
so my main objection to that or I always

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,010
put it back on them and I say compared

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:43,070
to what right and so they they say well

00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,660
you're you're so expensive or you know

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:48,320
why are you so expensive and I say well

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:50,750
compared to what right and depending on

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,000
their answer right you know I'll hit

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,580
them with another objection right but

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,990
that usually makes them think for a

00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,250
second they're like oh well you're you

00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,400
know there's really nothing to compare

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,900
this to right right it's not like a

00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:09,440
there's not a price comparison out there

00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:11,300
for web design yeah but there are but

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,770
yeah there's plenty of objections but I

00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:17,930
have a an objection like formula so if

00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,490
you want to get with me after the talk I

00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:24,130
can actually send that over if you want

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:24,130
yeah yeah how do you nurture your leads

00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:30,440
once you get your lead how do you

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:33,410
nurture that along so I use active

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,910
campaign active campaign has a CRM

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:40,670
feature in there so of course I have my

00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:43,430
my standard fancy CRM in an Excel

00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:46,820
spreadsheet right so that's my preset my

00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:48,530
pre sales process right and then once I

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,200
qualify them and I get them to the point

00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:53,330
like oh I need to put these subscribers

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,420
into a nurture process that's when I

00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,460
upload you know that one or ten or five

00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,100
into active campaign and I have a

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,220
sequence of emails depending on what

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,270
service I've qualified them for and

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,770
there's going to nurture them through

00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,780
that process so about seven to ten

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:10,290
emails is going to nurture them through

00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,410
that process

00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:15,620
and if we if they don't hit the goal by

00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:18,330
the end of that seventh or tenth email

00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:23,100
then I'm gonna recycle them through

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:26,850
another like anti follow-up sequence did

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:30,840
you give a short example so so for

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,580
e-commerce so I'm talking about an

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,170
expensive problem like cart abandonment

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,760
right so cart abandonment is an

00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:39,060
expensive problem is a common problem

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,750
and how much it could cost them right so

00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:45,930
I use statistics and stats and I have

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:49,680
links out to sites that they can read

00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:51,330
those stats and so for email marketing

00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,080
so for I do a quarterly newsletter

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:58,410
service and there's in that nurture

00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,870
sequence it's taking them through you

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,340
know stats and figures about quarterly

00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,020
newsletters and then it's telling them

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,080
this is actually a quarterly newsletter

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:09,060
that you're on you know so it's a it's

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:17,480
it's telling them you are on this

00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:17,480
service right now you

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,860
so it's always asking why right so when

00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:30,390
you get to the like qualification call

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:33,390
or you're researching so in the research

00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,470
phase without talking to them you're you

00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,420
know you're finding out what their

00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,220
business is right and I'm pretty

00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,230
familiar with that the two or three

00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,800
industries that I work in the most and

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,800
so I know I sort of know those expensive

00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,240
problems just by working in the industry

00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,160
but if you don't you can talk to them

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,720
and you can keep asking them you're like

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,430
how does your business work you know is

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,020
there is there people that help you

00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,250
along the process do you have product

00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,460
managers well what are the product

00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:02,040
managers do and and how are they expense

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,440
products and do they travel and you know

00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,360
what's the sales process like so just

00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,010
always it's like my three-year-old

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,360
daughter like Wow right she just asked

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,190
why why Wow

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,840
right why is the sky blue what's blue

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,030
because this will why right you just

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,800
keep just you know the three-year-old

00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,650
sales tactic right you just keep asking

00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,810
why over and over again and just always

00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,240
stay curious right I'm just curious by

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,830
nature and I just want to know you know

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,160
what makes their business tick and

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:31,170
you'll eventually find out that you know

00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,600
that homepage that they've self

00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,400
diagnosed their self with is really just

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,780
them trying to get acquired in the next

00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,490
nine months like oh we're just trying to

00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,390
clean up our business to get acquired in

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,490
the next nine months

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,830
oh it's then you don't need a homepage

00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,390
you need something else right so we need

00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,160
to clean up these other areas first

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,680
right so then you'll find out what that

00:32:47,160 --> 00:33:00,540
really expensive problem is to get them

00:32:49,680 --> 00:33:02,820
over that hurdle way in the back so it's

00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,010
a it's stopping them on social media

00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,920
right so it's easy nowadays so if I see

00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:10,110
a martini in their hand on social media

00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,210
that's the easy giveaway right but if I

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:16,110
you know if if I stalk through and I

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:18,090
don't see any alcohol pictures then my

00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,590
first lead in is gonna be a coffee right

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,590
because you're never gonna offend

00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,450
somebody with a coffee right they might

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,340
tell you oh I don't drink coffee but

00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,580
you're not going to offend them with

00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,580
coffee

00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:41,240
so I have an active campaign sequence

00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:43,490
for onboarding and and the freebies that

00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,280
I give away the client email templates

00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:49,820
there's an onboarding email sequence in

00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,170
there as well but it's telling them you

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,300
know you know welcome you know thank you

00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,130
for you know trusting me with your

00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,680
project thank you for your payment

00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,030
because if they're getting the email

00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,830
sequence that means they've paid me

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,830
already so thank you for your payment

00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,270
and then here's how to work with me you

00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,660
know bullet points here's an email

00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:10,670
primer here's a best so one of the next

00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:13,190
emails there is an email primer like

00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:15,050
here's how to best work with me over

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,850
email right because I don't want to box

00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,620
them into this project management

00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,440
solution right because they have enough

00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,780
going on right they have their own

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,429
database and their own work right so

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,970
let's just work via email right just

00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,800
old-school

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,170
right because I'm a I'm a solo operation

00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,390
so it's not like I'm managing a hundred

00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:35,240
different clients I'm only managing a

00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:37,520
handful of clients a month so and that

00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,179
helps you know that helps me get along

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,190
so I don't have to do like I don't have

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,530
to box people into my project management

00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,300
process I just work with them and they

00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,280
may have their own right they may they

00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,140
may already be working in asana and they

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,330
might they might want me to come into

00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,070
that and I have no problem with that so

00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,990
but the onboarding process is you know

00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,310
thanking them right you know for

00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:01,060
trusting me with their project and

00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:03,680
thanking them you know for the payment

00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:06,740
walking through how to work with me over

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,310
the next you know 10 12 14 or however

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,990
many weeks this project may P and then

00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:15,140
what it looks like during mid

00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:17,390
development so I have it timed so for

00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,780
certain services I have it timed where

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,670
at the fifth week mark that email is

00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,260
going to go out at the fifth week and so

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,330
here we are at your stage of the project

00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,370
blah blah blah and here's the next steps

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,110
for that and then here's what your

00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,280
website is going to look like where

00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,890
here's what your project is going to

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,080
look like for launch so I have that

00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,330
timed as well so towards the end of the

00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,090
project they start getting emails that's

00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,830
talking to them about what this launch

00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:45,380
this is going to look like they need to

00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:49,340
start gathering all the info that I need

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:51,620
like cPanel login information domain

00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,180
registrar login information etc so it

00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,920
starts priming them and prepping them to

00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,690
to get that information over to me and

00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,920
anything else that I may need and so

00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,320
that's what that onboarding and

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,320
nurturing process as a client looks like

00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:10,790
another question so you mentioned you

00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:13,310
did PSD to HTML someone was telling me I

00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:15,040
should look into Adobe XD for a

00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:19,610
responsive design but I was wondering

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:23,240
it's kind of a two-part question one do

00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:25,310
you make like doosh do you make them do

00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,680
you make the web design portion and then

00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:29,660
a mobile design portion separate in

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,980
Photoshop cuz I'm more of a Photoshop

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:36,110
person or do you like use whatever

00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,390
software tool and then second questions

00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,490
alright is do you send them the mock-ups

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,770
or do you kind of already have it done

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,540
and to show them so when I get the

00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:47,270
project it's been designed by someone

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:51,050
else and I'm just creating a custom

00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:54,700
child theme from that design so I'm not

00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,700
actually doing any of the design work

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,170
that make sense no I'm not outsourcing

00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,360
it's like a so like a traditional

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:08,390
marketing agency here in Atlanta would

00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,420
have their in-house designer design the

00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:13,630
web page you know the desktop version of

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,640
the tablet version and the phone version

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:18,410
and then they would come to me to to

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,900
create a custom WordPress child theme

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:23,180
from that design so I'm just getting the

00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,900
PSD files right the Photoshop files

00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,900
that's what I'm getting

00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,220
correct I'm the developer not the

00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,990
designer okay glasses can I get your

00:37:32,220 --> 00:38:11,010
contact cuz I'm kind of in the same boat

00:37:33,990 --> 00:38:13,740
where I'm more yeah I don't do any

00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:16,020
content I just do lorem ipsum right I

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,270
just dummy text the whole thing it's up

00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,330
to them that's where that's what happens

00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,040
I'm a fairly limited scope project so

00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,650
it's a fairly limited scope at a fixed

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,630
price I don't do any content right so

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,910
for e-commerce I'll set up three

00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,740
products right three dummy products I

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,950
create a tutorial video out of that

00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,750
right and so out of those three products

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:38,010
is three separate types of products so

00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,800
it might be a standard product a

00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,030
variable product and any other type of

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,860
product that they have but I create

00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:47,510
three tutorial videos for them really

00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:50,160
quickly and then they do all the

00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:55,559
handwork for their own products and

00:38:50,160 --> 00:39:00,049
their own content I guess

00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:02,579
you guy

00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:03,119
there are times yep so if I'm brought in

00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,949
early

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,439
I definitely guide them right so here's

00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:09,890
some I send them you know like some

00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:16,680
articles and you know knowledgebase

00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:23,339
links to some standard right right right

00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:26,160
right because I use Genesis for

00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:28,079
development right so I'll send them you

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,939
know a lot of Genesis resources right so

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,559
here's some standard practices for your

00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:33,509
header here's some standard practices

00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,549
for your footer and if you stick to

00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:37,769
these we're gonna have an easy smooth

00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:41,640
project yeah and that's if I'm brought

00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:43,799
in early if I'm not then I mean I just

00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,390
do what I'm told right so I may I may

00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,279
dig into it and I might find it

00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,619
difficult and so I'll just go back to

00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:51,089
the designer or I may go back to the

00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,410
client say hey this isn't really working

00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:54,809
but here's the solution

00:39:52,410 --> 00:40:12,779
I always come yeah yeah I always come

00:39:54,809 --> 00:40:14,130
with a solution but then your services

00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:18,199
you're saying you're doing though the

00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,199
development of design or so how

00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,570
how do those two things work together

00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,110
think if you're just working off of

00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:27,590
someone's design and developing them and

00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:30,930
the reason I'm asking is because I often

00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,850
the building out and the automation can

00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,670
be on the back end whoa where I feel

00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:39,420
like one of my strengths is building

00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:43,470
it's you know plucking back into an

00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,910
existing strategy so I struggled with

00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:47,930
how to talk about the results I'm

00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:57,900
creating everything is sort of the

00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:59,490
efficiency of the process versus so PSD

00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,040
to WordPress or development is just one

00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:05,670
service offering in my utility belt so

00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,860
marketing strategy or the brain work is

00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,130
really like the cash cow right

00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:13,560
and so for them in the medical device

00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:17,310
example I work with them very early on

00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,880
and I developed the patient outreach

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,680
strategy because they had a focus group

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,090
and they did research and they found it

00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,940
in that particular type of surgery which

00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,770
is heart surgery the patient had direct

00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,160
influence on what goes in their body in

00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,720
terms of heart valve and so it was it

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,630
was a no-brainer to create a patient

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,690
outreach strategy in tandem with a

00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:45,000
surgeon outreach strategy as well and so

00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:46,650
that's that's what I developed early on

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,740
so I was able to develop everything from

00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:52,770
scratch like the automations the

00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:55,280
informational sites etc yeah so that's

00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,280
yeah

00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:15,410
so that's that's the best format right

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,329
there if you follow that you'll probably

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,990
make an extra sixty thousand dollars

00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:23,240
this year right yeah

00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:25,579
just defining you know what it is that

00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,829
you do and what makes you unique and

00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:29,720
stand and stands out right and this can

00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:36,740
be your Linkedin summary right or your

00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:39,140
LinkedIn bio so you could go through

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,490
past projects right so you know one way

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,849
is to go through you know like you're

00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:45,410
real roster of past projects so and then

00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:47,539
find out what was the business outcome

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,630
like what what happened on the on the

00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:53,539
tail end of that project was it a better

00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,309
website was it a pay-per-click campaign

00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:59,329
like what was the what was on the other

00:42:55,309 --> 00:43:01,849
end of that project and then if possible

00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:04,789
reach out to the person or your contact

00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:07,900
and find out what happened like did you

00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:09,980
know did sales increase did you know

00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,680
support calls increase like what

00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,150
happened after your project especially

00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,519
if it's you know you've wrapped up the

00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:18,470
project for a significant amount of time

00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:21,109
right so reach out and get some feedback

00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:23,210
and find out what that is and go through

00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:24,410
your past projects and if you don't if

00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,210
you're just starting and you don't have

00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:28,220
past projects just think about a project

00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:30,019
that you would want to work on and try

00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,579
to reverse-engineer that and find out

00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:34,180
what would be the outcome to that

00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:34,180
project

00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:12,110
yeah and again it's not a death sentence

00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,730
you know you're just not like I'm gonna

00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,410
be stuck in that niche forever right

00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,480
you're going to get other types of work

00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:19,970
because you've become an authority or an

00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,830
expert in that one topic and other

00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:24,200
people are going to want to hire you for

00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:27,710
other things right well why don't you do

00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,570
Shopify right tell me why right and so

00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:32,240
you'll you'll end up getting work in

00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:34,640
other areas but you'll you'll make a

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,950
bulk of your money and that will in this

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,050
one area so if you follow this formula

00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:40,730
or this template you're going to get

00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,800
generalized you're gonna find out

00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:44,660
because it's gonna take some work to get

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,230
here right so this is not an easy task

00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:50,420
but once you get this down yeah

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,280
everything everything is going to be

00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,780
clear for you right so the content that

00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,160
you need to create for social media is

00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,350
going to come out of this it's gonna be

00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,360
really clear like everything is going to

00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:02,330
start to become crystal clear to you

00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,340
right how you should go about networking

00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,750
or what events you should go to right

00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,360
you're like well I've been wasting all

00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:10,310
my time at these events right once you

00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,970
get this down everything gets clear to

00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,970
you yeah

00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:24,470
yeah yeah and it's it's easy to get

00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:40,190
right well we know the person who builds

00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,690
the blueprints gets the money right

00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,299
that's the most profitable part of the

00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:47,749
project is building the blueprint you're

00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:50,240
building the house right you know you're

00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:53,089
not you're you're getting a larger sum

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,609
of money but over time is going to

00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:58,430
diminish right it's it's less profitable

00:45:55,609 --> 00:46:00,170
so you're at building the blueprint

00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:02,390
you're probably at you know 60 to 80

00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:04,730
percent profit margin if you're building

00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,680
the house you're probably at 30 or 20

00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,960
percent profit margin right over a

00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:12,309
period of time so the most profitable

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,309
part is your brain work

00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,720
the price

00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,790
exactly

00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,320
Oh

00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,550
Oh

00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:05,580
there's this one guy yep

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,180
look that he's a

00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,180
a thousand dollars

00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,639
[Music]

00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,900
yeah

00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:28,069
yeah

00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:38,760
yeah yeah right

00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:50,920
yeah and I founded it in order to get to

00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,690
this point to find out what it's worth

00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,750
just keep asking them why the why

00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:58,690
conversation so why you know why hire

00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:01,450
someone so expensive like me why take on

00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,250
a risky project and you know go through

00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,770
six or nine months of development why

00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:08,110
even do this why not go to up work and

00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:10,600
find someone why not go to fiber and

00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,010
hire someone there right and then

00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,960
through that they're going to tell you

00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:16,480
the reasons why right well we tried that

00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,130
already and it didn't work out or we

00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,540
need to do this now instead of six

00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,850
months from now right because we're

00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:24,460
we're bleeding cash at the moment and we

00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:26,110
need to fix this button problem that's

00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,760
happening on our site right so they're

00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:30,130
gonna they're gonna tell you why but

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,220
it's so if at any point they're like you

00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,940
know what I should go to up work then

00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,460
you know you don't have to write a

00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,400
proposal right you can hang up the phone

00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:43,000
and go back to what you were doing right

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,000
at any point so if there's no more

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,570
questions I'm a I'm done thank you for

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,470
showing up to hear me talk and I hope

00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:52,470
