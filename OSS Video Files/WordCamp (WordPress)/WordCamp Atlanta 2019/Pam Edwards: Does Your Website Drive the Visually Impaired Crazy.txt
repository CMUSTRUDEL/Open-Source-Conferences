thank you okay does your website drive

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,969
the visually-impaired crazy I'm here

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,849
because I get to sponsor at different

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,730
word camps and I get to hear all of you

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,010
come out the door and talk about how the

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,410
session went and we were in Asheville

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,680
and the developer came up to our table

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,599
and she was overwhelmed she had just

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,660
been to an accessibility workshop and

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,350
she was just starting out and it was a

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,780
side gig for her developing websites and

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,090
she was feeling she could never find the

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,480
time to go over all of the accessibility

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,329
issues let alone learn how to implement

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,870
them since everything was new so with a

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,750
sad shrug she kind of just said I think

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,800
I'll just ignore them for now so that

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:59,579
got me thinking I wonder are all the

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:05,400
issues strongly desired by those who

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:07,979
need the special okay I just lost my

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,400
train of thought I'm sorry are all the

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,590
accessibility issues strongly desired

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,619
for those who need them and then I

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,650
wondered how could I find this out and I

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,100
met a man named max ivy the blind

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,290
blogger at a conference and he's an

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,810
inspirational speaker if any of you are

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,270
in the market and I asked him what

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,000
drives you crazy about websites and what

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,009
do you wish every website had and he's

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,610
very passionate he was very glad to

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:42,450
share I'd love to read to you the number

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,030
one paragraph of his entire response my

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,820
number one pet peeve is sites that

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,610
constantly change if a website has a

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,000
real design flaw or is causing the users

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,549
or the owners problems and fine if a

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,689
site needs to be expanded that's cool

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,780
too but in my opinion any webmaster who

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,430
updates a site just to update it or just

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,770
to prove to their boss that they're

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,340
earning their paycheck should have to do

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,770
time the worst offender of this

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,840
principle is Facebook

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,420
and you can quote me I've said in

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,390
several interviews that if I ever meet

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,210
zuker Berg in the street I'm gonna knock

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,880
him on his keister I think this guy's a

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,060
really big guy and he didn't say keister

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,010
but that's what I'm saying here so he

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,350
shared what drove him crazy he

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,870
introduced me to some of his friends who

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,010
willingly shared some of them introduced

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,280
me to some of their friends who

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,310
willingly shared I also started a thread

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,920
on what unread it so what I get to share

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,610
with you today is the top three things

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:55,050
that drove the visually-impaired crazy

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:57,630
about websites so I want to say I'm not

00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,450
suggesting that you don't make your site

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,300
accessible why I'm here is because I

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,280
want a jumping-off place so I've gotten

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,170
answers of things that came up over and

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,780
over from people who need these things

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,080
and these are the top three as a bonus

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,090
they're relatively easy fixes and it's a

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,910
great way to jump in so I'm gonna assume

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,450
that most of us are sighted and

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:24,360
unfamiliar with screen readers so I have

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,480
two clips sorry about the buzz that kind

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,010
of introduced the screen readers I mean

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,040
one person who has been using screen

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,230
readers Braille raters scanning

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,330
equipment other adaptive technologies

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,459
since my childhood what a screen reader

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,380
does is for example I'm going to read

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,380
this start to read this page

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,110
I will now to slow down the speed train

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,800
great sixty percent fifty five fifty

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,990
percent twenty five forty percent link

00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,990
UCSF Medical Center so as I was about to

00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:06,400
say the screen reader converts what's on

00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:08,350
a computer screen into information that

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,110
can be displayed through synthetic

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,489
speech or Braille at play and it does

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,660
that by allowing you to use a computer

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,930
instead of a mouse a computer keyboard

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,510
instead of the mouse you can also use a

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,940
Braille display as an input device and

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,560
navigation and what it does is it

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,050
cleverly determines what's on the screen

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,580
and present you that information in a

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,090
way that would allow for efficient

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,460
navigation of these pages so for example

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,500
I could just keep reading about our

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,830
three items

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,120
visited link image home line by Lionel

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,220
inkubator all day

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,440
or I could jump to the first heading on

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,690
the page heading level to search for

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,630
penny level to you are here heading

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,340
level one main video successful so as

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,080
I'm moving down to the page I can look

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,850
for the category that interests me and

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,630
I'm just using commands built into the

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,940
screen reader okay and this is another

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,640
perspective but he also talks about the

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,000
speed of screen readers my name is Hana

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:15,430
Danny and I remember whitey axis of

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,169
eighteen Washington using the screen

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:22,360
reader he's an accessibility expert and

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,050
he's also a user of accessible

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,539
technology

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,910
he uses a refreshable Braille display

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:31,660
and screen reading software that reads

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,000
everything on the screen I am right and

00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:39,180
I use

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,710
for them at home here everyone security

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,810
the program is a software that

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:47,960
complicates with the operating system

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,960
and kind of ways the information to me

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,890
we were reading as a sighted person you

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:05,070
sometimes will have to review what you

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:08,490
have just information for us is the same

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,450
thing when we are reading from normal

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,750
conversation in camping there very fast

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:30,320
then but when you are really taking more

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:32,280
content I have a university but if we

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:45,930
email I can

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:46,310
I love that no you'd have to get used to

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,400
it

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:53,010
so here's a side note could you please

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,780
shovel the ramp all these other kids are

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,850
waiting for the stairs when I get

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,190
through shoveling them then I'll clear

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,620
off the ramp for you but if you shovel

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,090
the ramp we can all get in clearing the

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,850
path for people with special needs

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,890
clears the path for everyone and why

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,590
this works is because as you make your

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:13,140
sites more accessible you tend to make

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,390
them simpler which makes it easier for

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,160
everybody to navigate and use your site

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,690
I also like this quote from Eve Anderson

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,450
the director of accessibility

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,430
engineering at Google the accessibility

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,260
problems of today here we're going to

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,600
talk about screen readers are the

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,790
mainstream breakthroughs of tomorrow

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,410
and what's the technological

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:39,060
breakthrough that we are sitting on

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:42,780
today Amy know you guys all know voice

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:46,020
technology voice technology is exploding

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,900
and the bonus is as you make your site

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,940
more accessible to screen reader you are

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,390
setting yourselves up for when voice

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:59,760
technology is available all over the

00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:01,770
place for your information to get

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,050
channeled to smart speaker and all the

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:09,030
devices that they're putting that voice

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:12,030
technology into so let's get to the top

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,520
three things that drive vision impaired

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,880
people crazy let me recognize the

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,680
semblance of a family feud board number

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,090
three

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:27,780
survey says unlabeled buttons and edit

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,789
fields let's talk about edit fields how

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,310
a screen reader works is it starts at

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,990
the top it goes from left to right left

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,080
to right till it gets to the bottom it's

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,539
extremely linear so if I have not used

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,289
the label let me get this word right

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:46,110
label element to tie the name to the

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:49,920
actual box the screen reader is going to

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,590
this and say HTML forms first name :

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,020
last name : edit field blank edit field

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,650
blank submit button and it can be worse

00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,420
if I have other things on my page if I

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,720
have this kind of stuff it might say

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,110
HTML forms join us as we go first name :

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,960
last name : edit field blank edit field

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,530
blank to Disney in 2020 more submit

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,740
button details to follow yeah so it can

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:19,680
be it can be hard the good news is even

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,490
though apparently Guttenberg failed its

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,100
own accessibility test quite recently

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:30,270
they have made it really easy for you to

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,790
make your sites more accessible so here

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,590
we're asks you to write your label

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,810
however you're gonna whatever you're

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,240
going to call your edit field it

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:42,030
behind-the-scenes automatically uses

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,940
that label element and attaches it to

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:47,010
the actual box so if you're building by

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,040
hand you need to use the label element

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:53,550
and link the name of that box with the

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,290
actual box but Gutenberg doesn't okay so

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,170
the third most popular response was

00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,680
unlabeled buttons and edit fields number

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,570
two

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:09,270
survey says missing alt text for

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:10,470
graphics and tables so graphics there's

00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,780
three different ways you can look at

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,770
graphics and all three come back to this

00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,810
idea why did you include the graphic so

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:22,110
we can think of graphics as decoration

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:27,000
as examples or something that adds

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:28,680
information so as a decoration remember

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,070
in that second video we're how they said

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,200
Hadi said that we don't read things with

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,670
the same intensity we don't read

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,800
everything at the same intensity it's

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,660
the same thing with images sometimes

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,030
they need a lot of description and

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:46,590
sometimes not when you're using a

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:49,020
graphic as a decoration not now you can

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,240
skimp on the on the detail I'm not

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:55,010
telling you don't be detailed because

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,950
alt text is greatly appreciated

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:01,800
this is from that reddit thread

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,050
Wikipedia has excellent alts for images

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,720
I looked at a few and this one made me

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,600
smile a photograph of a middle-aged

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,970
white man with gray hair his mouth is

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,649
open and his arms are raised near to his

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,440
shoulders suggesting he's giving a

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,120
public speech he's wearing a black suit

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,300
jacket with a light blue shirt and

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,529
Maathai a purple and yellow you kept

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,750
rosette is attached to his jacket I got

00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,899
several responses back that use that for

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:34,019
his made me smile talking about labeling

00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:38,430
things so if you have the inclination be

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:40,649
detailed but if not let's go back it's

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,600
difficult to find population numbers for

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,639
sea turtles because male and juvenile

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,620
sea turtles do not return to shore once

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,209
they hatch and reach the ocean which

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,209
makes it hard to keep track of them

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,839
there so when it's raining wherever all

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:03,240
text is isn't gonna interrupt that

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:05,339
paragraph yes depending on how you have

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:12,690
defined your regions and your headings

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:15,529
so necessarily right totally depends on

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,529
how you've done it

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:27,629
okay so that's another fuzzy thing

00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:30,419
because oh yes if you don't put it in

00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:33,749
the alt text are you in violation of a

00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:35,999
DEA compliance so you guys can correct

00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:39,749
me if I'm wrong from what I understand

00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:41,429
there is nothing legal yet people who

00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:43,619
are bringing lawsuits against companies

00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:47,639
whose websites are not accessible are

00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:50,189
winning so soon it will become lost not

00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,919
legislated then from the bench but at

00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:56,419
this point there's still guidelines does

00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,419
that answer yes am I wrong about that

00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:05,279
where is the guideline sheet well we get

00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:07,349
to near the end of this talk I will help

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,939
you with that I'm not going to cover all

00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:15,629
the guidelines but I will show you where

00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:17,639
they are okay okay so I read this if I

00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,229
took when I took that picture out it

00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,049
really didn't change the information

00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:25,129
that I was sharing so on this my alt

00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:27,209
text or figcaption would be a sea turtle

00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:32,009
basically I want to tell the screen

00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:34,199
reader what's there now graphics as an

00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:36,600
example the amount of space between

00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,359
objects and a hive determines how the

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,429
bees will build their comb 3/8 of an

00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:43,919
inch is the perfect amount of space for

00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:47,129
bees to move around and they won't build

00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,639
comb in that space this will probably

00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:53,189
make more sense when I add the graphic

00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:55,589
it doesn't add information but it does

00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:57,829
help you understand the information so I

00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:01,619
would spend more time on the alt text

00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:05,369
honeycomb some flat some built out in an

00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:07,679
odd shape again if you want to take the

00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:10,679
time to be more detailed do it it's

00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,049
greatly appreciated but also a little is

00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:17,579
better than none so graphic is a

00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:20,279
decoration graphic as an example and now

00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,019
graphic that adds information when we

00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,209
look at cola products we see that most

00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,069
people prefer coca-cola the least

00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,379
preferred Cola is Pepsi lite

00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:32,899
okay this is not to meant to be

00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,899
real-world although we are in Atlanta

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,930
ask yourself why include this so I

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:43,589
included it to show that coca-cola is

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:46,910
way more popular than Pepsi light so how

00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:51,089
might I alt Texas column chart showing

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:52,310
73% prefer coca-cola 17% prefer Pepsi

00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,589
Light

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,810
now this is a judgement call it really

00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:00,779
depends on the level of detail that's in

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:03,269
your content and on who you are I

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,110
probably wouldn't pay attention to the

00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:12,120
different products or to the specific

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:14,220
percentages I would probably just look

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,959
to understand yeah coke is very popular

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:21,120
and let's digress here just a little bit

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,769
because I think this leads to concept

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,839
that might help oh did I miss this I

00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:31,050
think I got mixed up here okay so our

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,320
sites are unique you're unique

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,870
you're presenting your information

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:41,220
uniquely for example I'm not detail

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:43,620
oriented so you saw my little alt text

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,810
and if you came to my site you're not

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,399
gonna get nitty gritty details my blog

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,490
posts are pretty much going to be big

00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,790
picture and you may or may not like my

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:56,640
style my husband I'm sorry this is gonna

00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:00,750
totally repeat again my husband is a

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,880
very detailed person and it drove him

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,800
crazy as I was doing these slides

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,269
because my alt text just do not have

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,070
enough information but people are screen

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:14,370
reader users are people just like us

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,410
they might hit my site and go yes and

00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,990
alt text it's incredibly brief that just

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,060
goes big picture if they hit my site and

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,130
they're saying I wonder what other

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,810
information was in that graphic that

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,149
she's not sharing I wonder how it could

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,610
have impacted then they'll bail on me

00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:32,130
they'll go and read somebody else's site

00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,589
that has all that detail and that's okay

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,600
that makes it actually more comfortable

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,120
for me adding the alt text because I can

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,520
match it to what I imagine somebody

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,910
would want from that image

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:49,300
okay last time you're gonna have to look

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:51,820
at this so how much description should

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,160
you add to your graphics it depends on

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,700
the level of detail that you're putting

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,790
into your information and who you ask so

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:04,540
be yourself decide why did you put that

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:06,819
in there and write your alt text to

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,939
match it okay I lied you're gonna have

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,740
to look at this slide again sorry okay

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:15,309
so I wanted to use that same graphic

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,740
because it's specific in the other two

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:19,059
ways so this is as a decoration charts

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,370
are an excellent way to share the

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:24,069
information quickly but mostly for the

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:26,679
sighted when using charts and articles

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,270
be sure to add a caption or an alt text

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,760
to your chart so the screen reader can

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:34,090
make sense of it I would caption this

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,840
column chart if I was using it as an

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,940
example

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,309
depending on how you organize your data

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,630
your chart can have values that add up

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,600
to more than 100 percent

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,790
I personally would alt Texas column

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,330
chart where values add more than 100

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:51,850
percent on this particular one chip

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,790
actually begged me to use this 1 column

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,700
chart with 6 columns whose value adds up

00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,870
to two hundred and thirty six percent

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:04,660
it's just details it's a judgment call

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,610
okay this quote is from a person on that

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,559
reddit thread that highlights the

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,210
importance of labeling things the

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,700
buttons the text fields and graphics I

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,030
don't use jaws which is a screen reader

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,460
but my dad does and even I get annoyed

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:21,070
at hearing it screech blank on some

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,620
websites and notice the verb twice their

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:28,710
screech it's obviously a frustrating

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:31,960
situation back to our board number one

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,550
this was included by everyone who used

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,320
the screen reader and I'd asked

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,270
open-ended questions what drives you

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:43,080
crazy they could have said everything it

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:47,440
was oh survey says headings headings

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:50,140
headings so if you do only one thing to

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,900
make your site more accessible for the

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,510
vision impaired use headings and here's

00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:00,100
what they mean by that

00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:02,470
you can achieve this look by using very

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,780
large font making it bold or a smaller

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,910
font down to the font that you're going

00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,710
to use for the body of your text so this

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,570
gives you the visual clues that you need

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,970
to see how the page is organized but it

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,940
doesn't help the visually impaired and

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:19,210
it doesn't help the screen readers if

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,370
you add headings as formatting you make

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,590
everybody happy so this could be a

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,720
heading one this could be a heading two

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,270
and then the body of your paragraph of

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,450
your text I think Gutenberg calls it

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,880
paragraph and again Gutenberg did make

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,880
this easy because you have to define all

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,590
of your text blocks so just define your

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,230
headings as headings whatever heading

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,300
you want or define I think the text is

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,520
just called paragraph if you're doing it

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:54,970
by hand and you have to actually format

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:56,590
it as the different headings I'm gonna

00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,450
let him tell you so I have three

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,640
different clips of people because then

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,290
you'll see kind of how it works and they

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,290
use it oh I'm sorry

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,260
so how does a screen reader hit these

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,940
headings and talk does it say heading

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,180
one Alexa and the elderly

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,220
heading to whatever and you'll see the

00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:18,220
answer to that I have three clips from

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,890
three different people again just to

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,040
give you ideas oh wait I forgot to do

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,040
this

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:41,129
the best fittings is also it means to

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:45,600
get information about the structure of

00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:48,539
the content it gives me a good

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:53,009
understanding good overview about the

00:20:48,539 --> 00:21:00,090
major or minor component of the car so I

00:20:53,009 --> 00:21:04,080
see that here accessible University

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:06,929
itself is a heavy one and access under

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,860
that we have features a story which is

00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:13,409
able to automatically come where is the

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:18,240
information that this section is a

00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:20,940
subsection of the heading about unity

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,590
that also that over bound get an outline

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:29,759
of the page and the major sections of

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:32,269
that and then that's the next - we'll

00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:36,419
explain that a little better

00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:39,110
one thing you should know is that having

00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,970
a screen reader by itself does not make

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,549
the internet accessible to me if you

00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:49,250
look at our homepage as I navigate

00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:52,550
through it you'll find it there headings

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,560
inde jeans which the designers have made

00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,390
some effort to put into the page that

00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,050
allowed me to jump from section to

00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:01,790
section so I don't have to stop and

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,760
explore it every little link to find

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:07,010
where I want to be on some web pages

00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,980
where there might be almost a hundred

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,470
links but yet there's no way to skip to

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:16,430
the main part of the article that I want

00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:20,300
to read so I have to skip from link to

00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:25,640
link to link jump from section to

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:27,110
section to find where I want to be okay

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,470
and this girl's gonna probably make you

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,470
smile

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:39,010
[Music]

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,970
I'm an avid web editor and you just

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,970
bring your cult dolls

00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:58,330
I don't have all day I don't think so I

00:22:55,749 --> 00:23:01,570
do a lot of but I can only do that in

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:05,580
the beach so here is how we do it

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:08,230
perfect example is this homepage here

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:35,710
windows Internet Explorer from the page

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:39,070
name I already know what's there okay so

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:42,450
the first one was the biggest impact for

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,019
the least amount of effort headings

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,820
number two

00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:48,570
adding the alt text for your graphics

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,490
and tables and the third response was

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,679
labeling your buttons and the Edit

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,990
fields so here's the next three

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,409
responses just for free number four was

00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,919
unfriendly CAPTCHA now this is getting

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:01,960
fixed

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,879
yeah it's unfriendly to everybody but

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,519
this is getting fixed because whoever

00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:08,799
wrote the algorithm that's now checking

00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,509
to see how you're using your computer so

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,100
if you're using it as a human it pushes

00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:14,769
you through if it thinks you're a bot it

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:18,369
doesn't push you through which I love

00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:20,230
that because anything that is strong

00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:23,289
enough to confuse a bot is strong enough

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,090
to confuse a screen reader not only that

00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:27,669
I got a response back from somebody who

00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:30,340
was blind and deaf and her response

00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:35,440
there are no friendly CAPTCHAs for her

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:37,809
what was sad okay number five hover

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,929
cards that need a mouse if you need a

00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:43,450
screen reader you can't use a mouse and

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:45,850
apparently it's very difficult to move

00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,470
your screen reader back up to find where

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:52,200
is that window that popped up that

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,100
stopped everything and then number six

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,990
was fast

00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:04,529
Reeth yes

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:07,289
so--that's yes and I got a comment too

00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:09,200
about it being silent oh yes what do we

00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,120
mean by hovercard

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,149
does it mean the things when you hover

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,990
over text a window or some information

00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:21,510
pops up so I kind of blended two ideas

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,580
and that was those hover cards and one

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,500
of the comments was the fact that those

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,840
are silent are a problem for them

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,460
because they don't hear that oh there's

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,090
information there I should go look for

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,970
it and then I mixed in that idea of a

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,519
window that pops up because windows that

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:41,820
pop up that require a mouse to go close

00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,980
it and they hide those crazy little X's

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,070
in different places so both of those

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:50,519
things are not easy for them to work

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:54,059
with so the sixth thing was fast refresh

00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:57,690
rates this came back one part of it came

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:59,730
back to a simple web page so the first

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,590
part of a fast refresh rate if you've

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:04,080
set up your pages who refreshed very

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:06,840
quickly let me back up one more step

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,200
when your page refreshes the screen

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,299
reader pops back to the top so if you

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,000
have a page that's refreshing quickly

00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:16,919
someone using a screen reader may never

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,610
even get down to the information that

00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,070
they want the second half of that is if

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:25,620
your page has a lot of information on it

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:28,320
and it's very complicated they may not

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,169
get through the information before they

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,929
get bumped back up to the top and that's

00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:36,240
another reason that headings came up a

00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:39,139
lot because they can use the headings to

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,139
kind of tap through

00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:49,860
okay I'm not the technical person in my

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:52,559
oh I'm sorry so examples of fast refresh

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,100
rates and I have read this but I don't

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,470
remember

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,320
does anybody know cuz you can top it out

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:02,640
to super fast as anyone know how many

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:07,730
times per second that is or minute okay

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:10,740
I don't know I'm sorry okay do or I

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:13,350
sponsor with the technical person of our

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,750
company so we're upstairs if you want to

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:27,059
come ask him tip he will know the answer

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:28,320
to that so what I understand cuz I

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,909
researched oh I'm sorry

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:36,240
what happens when a pop-up window pops

00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:39,419
up and you have to go say okay or hit

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,820
the X so I researched this I don't

00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:44,159
actually use a screen reader so what I

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,929
heard back from them was you have to

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,149
take your screen reader and bounce it

00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:50,070
around until it can find the window and

00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:54,990
then they can tell it to close it the

00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:57,720
problem is finding it yeah yeah so the

00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:00,140
fast fast refresh rates that was very

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,140
interesting

00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,739
[Music]

00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:20,739
so do I know of any pop-up tools that

00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:22,720
are a DEA compliant so that it does make

00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:26,379
it easier for them to close and the

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,779
answer is I don't so if you research

00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:30,820
that you can do one of these talks next

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:36,809
time and talk about how fast the refresh

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,809
rate has to go okay

00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:50,830
sorry about this so I also got responses

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,309
I'm not exactly sure what's happening to

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:59,980
second I also got responses from people

00:28:54,309 --> 00:29:02,110
with low vision so can you guess what

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:07,000
the number one comment is gonna be of

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:14,139
what drives them crazy lack of contrast

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:16,720
oh yes is that hard to see yes that was

00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:19,299
amazing and it becomes a big problem as

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,120
we age and the baby boomers are getting

00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:24,399
older so this is this is big and some

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,649
people put on their wish list that they

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,870
could reverse that there would be an

00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:36,700
easy button to reverse the background

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:39,789
and the text and number two input field

00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,370
not outlined so I found that interesting

00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:44,590
because I think and I shouldn't have

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,470
said not outlined I should have said not

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:50,620
clearly defined because I think that's

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,750
true even on our site after doing this

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,549
we have to change some things because

00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:58,029
lots of times those input fields are

00:29:54,549 --> 00:30:02,529
defined by color change or they have a

00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:09,460
really tiny little border around it here

00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:12,279
we go I'm still learning okay back it

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,440
one more time and it is apparently very

00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:16,360
frustrating one person said I just have

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,789
to keep poking at my screen until I

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,769
finally stumble upon it and when I read

00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:23,889
comments like that you can just kind of

00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:25,929
hear the frustration okay so now to what

00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:28,600
you were interested in I would like to

00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:30,370
change tacks a little bit and just give

00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,529
you an idea of where the web

00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,000
accessibility guidelines come from so

00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,950
we're not going to go through them and

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,490
this is going to be one of those big

00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:39,639
picture not very many details things

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,710
okay

00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:45,190
the web accessibility guidelines are

00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:49,539
called web content web content

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:52,179
accessibility guidelines WCAG 2.0

00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,799
currently they come from the parent

00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:57,220
organization of

00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,379
the World Wide Web Consortium and they

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,529
come specifically from a branch of the

00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:05,139
World Wide Web Consortium called the web

00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:08,350
accessibility initiative so here's a

00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:09,759
couple more definitions so that this is

00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,309
a little bit makes a little bit more

00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,019
sense these site these slides will also

00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:16,419
be on our site which I'll give you the

00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:20,289
link at the end so you don't have to

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:22,480
write if it's too much okay the World

00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:25,269
Wide Web Consortium defines themselves

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,850
as an international community where

00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:29,710
member organizations full-time staff and

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:34,330
the public worked together to develop

00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:36,730
standards like HTML CSS etc they define

00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,230
their mission as to lead the world wide

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,950
web to its full potential

00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:44,200
by developing protocols and guidelines

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,359
so the guy who started World Wide Web

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,109
Consortium is actually the guy who

00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:52,720
started the world wide web protocols I

00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:55,480
think that's the right word so his goal

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,220
is let's make this all work it isn't

00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,720
necessarily just focused on

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:04,869
accessibility for people with

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:07,480
disabilities so branch of the w3c is the

00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:11,169
web accessibility initiative or waa I

00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,659
this is from their literature the w3c

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:16,029
web accessibility initiative develops

00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:17,940
standards and support materials to help

00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:21,220
you understand and implement

00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:24,999
accessibility they have a lot of

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:28,269
resources and they once you get into the

00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:30,220
lists of the guidelines to me it got a

00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:32,769
little dense and it was easier for me

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,179
when I went to YouTube and found

00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:37,239
somebody who kind of talked my language

00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:40,690
and explained it but they did have a lot

00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:44,320
of help through how to implement the

00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:46,029
guidelines in different applications so

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,379
I thought that was interesting I also

00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:50,139
thought is interesting that they're open

00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:53,320
to the public we invite individuals and

00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:55,059
organizations to participate in w AI by

00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,989
implementing promoting and reviewing

00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:01,570
stuff so if this is like a passion of

00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:03,369
yours look them up one of the groups

00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:06,039
that's open right now is the CAPTCHA

00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:07,480
group so I wondered and didn't look to

00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:13,570
find out is that

00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:15,549
that algorithm came from so those that

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:20,590
web and they should a web accessibility

00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:24,490
initiative group wing came up with the

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:26,620
web content accessibility guidelines and

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:29,110
this is from their literature it covers

00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,649
a wide range of recommendations for

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:34,269
making web content more accessible and

00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:37,090
then it goes into all the different

00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:39,820
areas that they work with including

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:42,490
blindness low vision deafness hearing

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,649
loss learning disabilities cognitive

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:47,169
limitations limited movement speech

00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:49,779
disabilities photo sensitivity and

00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:53,049
combinations of these and it's needed

00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:58,299
and this is why it gets complicated

00:33:53,049 --> 00:34:01,389
really fast so oh I also want to tell

00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:04,120
you they came up with a 2.1 which adds

00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:08,679
to the 2.0 but that's not necessarily

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:12,460
superseded okay so that is your very

00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,960
general very non detailed overview so

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,970
let's go back to the core of what I

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,099
really wanted to show share with you

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,810
what drives the visually impaired crazy

00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:23,200
and what do they really want from your

00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:26,679
site they really want defined regions

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,980
and headings they really want alt texts

00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:33,639
for graphics they really want labelled

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:36,040
buttons and edit fields so web sites are

00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,429
such a huge part of how we live and how

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,770
we interact that it's really important

00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:43,839
to make them accessible so if you're

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:46,270
overwhelmed with the thought of meeting

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,780
all of the needs of every disabled

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:53,290
person start here start with these three

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:57,730
things and I think it's exciting that

00:34:53,290 --> 00:35:01,630
this came from them I do not know how

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,700
that got doubled okay so do you have any

00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:07,650
questions that I might be able to answer

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,650
that you haven't asked yet yes

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:18,740
define regions is that automatically

00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:21,200
happened within WordPress ok this was

00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:25,849
another kind of area that I decided to

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:29,660
not deal with so it's Aria is what they

00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:34,579
call it accessible region does anyone

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:36,559
know that what Aria stands for yeah I

00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:39,339
can't remember either so if you get

00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,339
online and look

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:54,049
accessible accessible rich yes he's

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,859
saying something accessible rich

00:35:54,049 --> 00:36:00,380
Internet applications ok so if you get

00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:02,779
into that you will again find a couple

00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,670
branches so one of that is talking about

00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:07,910
going from your computer to your tablet

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:10,069
to your phone making it it rich so that

00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,839
it could change it can be accessible in

00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:14,180
all those different environments it will

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,640
also have the disability side of that

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,890
and then part of that is defining the

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,880
regions which is the heading the

00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,789
sidebars

00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,220
the main text the banner at the bottom

00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:30,640
and no I don't know about WordPress

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,640
sorry yes

00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:47,560
so that is also on oh I'm sorry is there

00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:50,970
a specific tool that I know about that

00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:54,190
tests whether your site is accessible so

00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:56,920
there are lots of them out there and no

00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:00,820
I don't have a specific one but even on

00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:05,620
the W AI site they will they have tools

00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:06,840
to test your website and in on YouTube I

00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:16,080
found some too

00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:18,880
sorry to be general I do not analyze so

00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:21,730
I'm part of creating my voice and we

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
work with getting content onto smart

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,870
speakers so I get to work with some of

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,860
the accessibility stuff because the

00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:32,110
smart speakers really are quite vision

00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,450
impaired friendly so this is something I

00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:37,930
enjoyed and researched but I'm not I'm

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:39,960
not the technical part of our team yes

00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,960
sir

00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:51,640
the future the idea for SEO

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,200
we have Yoast school that's hanging your

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,480
NCOs looking pretty good that's where

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,050
the thing it's not 100% but it is an

00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,530
idea

00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:03,250
it's very plugin for accessibility for

00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:06,190
WordPress that does something so there

00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,300
is a plug-in Yoast that tells you how

00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,960
SEO

00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,730
how is your site doing with its SEO and

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,040
he's asking is there something like that

00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,500
with accessibility and that's another

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,850
answer I don't have and I would be

00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:23,830
surprised if it's not there one of the

00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:27,040
things that I ran into on YouTube was a

00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:29,530
site that they have actually in their

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,450
WordPress people have actually built a

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:36,010
program that will go out and gather all

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:38,020
the images all the images is images from

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,540
all of the sites that you're building

00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,690
and put them in one place so you can alt

00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,640
text them or slowly work through them so

00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:48,960
you don't have to go to so I know that

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,960
people are working at that

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,910
he's seen some plugins out there that

00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:20,350
are still in the early stages yes ma'am

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:22,540
right so the question is if you build

00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,340
your site by hand you're not really

00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,750
aware of all of these different things

00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:30,760
if you use a template will they be

00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,920
addressed more easily so I can tell you

00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,570
yes Gutenberg has worked on that I don't

00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:40,600
know about other ones so personally I'm

00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:42,820
not a detailed person I would use the

00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,400
templates all the way my husband whose

00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:50,610
detail he loves to go into the HTML and

00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,610
do everything himself so 10 pens a yard

00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,680
[Music]

00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:11,560
okay so she googled a DA did you say

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:13,300
compliant WordPress plugins for

00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,070
accessibility and it came up with 10

00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,790
plugins that you can use it'll check

00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:23,740
your site so you can find these slides

00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:27,730
that create my voice calm backslash W C

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:30,040
- ATL I'm also going to put in all of

00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:33,100
the responses that that I got back

00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,470
because it's really eye-opening and it's

00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,910
good reading and if you do these three

00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,350
things and you're like I'm ready for

00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,780
another one you can just pick a couple

00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,400
and make somebody really happy so thank

00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:48,360
you very much for sharing your pilot

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,360
