Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	If you’re building profitable WordPress sites for yourself or client, you can increase their value and improve user experience through A/B testing. This talk will walk you through the basic technical, statistical, and strategic concepts you’ll need to get started and close with a survey of tools you can use – including one that’s fully integrated into WordPress.

all right thanks right on thanks

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,319
everybody

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,469
yep that's me I'm Brian here to talk

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,259
about a/b testing I've been doing a/b

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,960
test implementation development and

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,720
strategy and analysis for the last four

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,660
or five years or so Georgia State

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,300
Georgia State grad go Panthers what's up

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,730
yeah okay right um this is my first time

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,980
at WordCamp as a speaker or attendee so

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,900
thank you so much everybody for the warm

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,290
welcome and all the stuff I've learned

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,750
already and in the interest of honoring

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,239
your time and attention I want to lead

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,760
with this magic number

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,420
and we need a new lamp for the projector

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,430
just duly noted five hundred so this

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,210
kind of magic number is the number of

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,120
conversions that you need per month on

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,190
your website to really get value out of

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,440
a be testing so I just thought I'd throw

00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,879
this up here right away early on if

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,469
anybody sees that and thinks we'll

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,449
forget it and you want to like sneak out

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,799
I'll be hurt a little bit but like I

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,580
want you to use your time well this

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,200
weekend so like No no hard feelings at

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,630
the same time if you don't have a

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,520
website or a client with a website

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,530
that's currently getting 500 conversions

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,280
a month this kind of stuff can happen

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,930
fast

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,210
you know you might build out an ecomp

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,710
site and they stumble around for six

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,720
months trying to find their market and

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,420
then BAM something hits and they're

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,860
there and and it's time to think about

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,320
optimization and experimentation on the

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,630
site you might build some sort of like a

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,159
lead capture site for somebody in one

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,409
day they're like okay I want to bunch it

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,329
I want to dump a bunch of money into

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,340
Google AdWords and if you're paying for

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,350
your visitors you definitely want to be

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,530
doing some sort of optimization program

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,689
to get cheaper clicks and so this stuff

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,270
becomes relevant when you hit that magic

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,479
number and just so it's clear

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,250
conversions 500 conversions as in a

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,100
thing that makes you money on the

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,680
website so not just a click or a page

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,630
view or a video play although those are

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,829
great and you know we care about those

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,910
but we're talking purchases ecommerce or

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:12,300
subscriptions to your mailing list if

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,800
you have monetized that or signups and

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,540
lead submissions if you have a

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,300
sales driven product that's that's the

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,410
500 I'm talking about here and we'll get

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,840
into why a little bit so this this is my

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,790
outline for today just gonna explain

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,950
kind of the basics of a/b testing

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,960
because I don't really know who's in the

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,700
room hi hey nice to meet you all I don't

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,190
really know your level or experience or

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,560
comfort with the topic it does get kind

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,470
of complicated but I'm gonna try to give

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,450
it a pretty basic pass and then talk

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,950
about why you would want to do it the

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,530
point of it what you can expect to

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,270
benefit from it and then we'll dive into

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,430
some specifics of how you can actually

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,900
set up and start doing this yourself

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,150
and my intention is to make this a

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,980
fairly light pass over these topics and

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,810
then we'll go deep on the questions

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,520
that's my hope so I do hope that I can

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,960
keep Bell in the room and that you'll

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,370
have some questions when we get to the

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,530
end all right so what the what of a/b

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,820
testing what is it so I'm gonna define

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,040
it and then we're gonna do a quick

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,200
action-packed live demo brace yourselves

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,670
and then hopefully by the end of that

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,080
everyone will have a sense like okay

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,190
yeah I get it I know what this guy's up

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,440
here rambling about okay so I won't read

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,690
it to you you're welcome

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,670
you can all read I'm gonna leave these

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,370
words on the screen for a little while

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,730
and kind of step through and talk about

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,020
some of the key points as we go so you

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,700
go ahead and read it to yourselves I

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,050
guess you probably already have I'm

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,190
going to talk about and call out what's

00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:46,800
important about this so first off

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:50,160
website now a be testing is it's an

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,709
experimental methodology that you can

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,140
use to optimize or to measure the impact

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:58,830
of changes across all kinds of channels

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,980
you can a be test your ad copy you can a

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,800
be test your outbound email headlines

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,930
you could a be test pickup lines if

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,930
that's like part of your lifestyle today

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,010
we're talking about website only just to

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,200
frame it so next up randomly

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,799
so with a/b testing we're randomly

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:23,160
choosing who sees what and this is key

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,690
if you're using rules and data to say

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,729
okay I want to show this guy this

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,639
experience but then I want to show her

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,220
this one

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,319
also a thing that's also a thing and

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,509
it's a lot of the same tools and process

00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,639
to get that done but that is called

00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,050
personalization and it's also

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,479
fundamentally different in the sense

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,280
that we're using statistical rigor to

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,199
say look this really works

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,599
look this experience is really better

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,030
and with personalization it's a lot more

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:50,530
of a hunch driven type of methodology

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,259
it's like oh this will probably work

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,659
right sure yeah and then you go do it

00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,310
so a little bit of judgment in there but

00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,530
we can go to that on the questions to

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,969
talk about the differences and when you

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,430
would use one or the other all right so

00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:08,860
like this is the maybe mind blown part

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,870
if you are do not have a background in

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,759
this if you haven't done this before if

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,219
you don't have a technical background

00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,330
this part is kind of strange to think

00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:20,440
about and this is kind of key so

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,419
simultaneously at the same moment in

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,029
time different people will be seeing

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:27,639
different things on the same page of

00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,039
your site and that's pretty much the

00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,259
whole point of it so if that doesn't

00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,419
really make sense yet that is okay just

00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,490
just roll with it we're about to do a

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,770
demo that I hope will help a little bit

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,620
in explaining or at least demonstrating

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,240
how that goes and then the last thing

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,270
last thing I'll call out but it's so

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,129
important it is a given metric so again

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,839
thanks everybody for coming to this talk

00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,279
there's a talk in another room that's

00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,650
about measuring everything on your

00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,779
website and I wish we could all be there

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,409
too it sounds awesome you can measure

00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:59,469
everything

00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:01,449
you cannot optimize everything you can

00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,889
optimize one thing and this comes back

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,389
to why I said it needs to be the thing

00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,879
that makes you money right it needs to

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:10,199
be purchases or signups because you can

00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:13,810
only choose one thing to optimize for

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,690
okay so if everybody's willing we're

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,969
gonna do a quick demo all right you have

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,440
a phone you have a laptop if I can

00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:22,870
convince you I'm sorry there's so many

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,089
letters in my name but if you would go

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,940
type this into a browser on whatever

00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,830
device you have give everyone a couple

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,430
minutes thank you so much for being so

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,709
so very willing and cooperative there's

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:39,190
a test running on this page so there is

00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:41,199
an technically an ABCD test running on

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,680
this page and so when you land on the

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,660
page

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,580
you will get one of those experiences a

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,889
B C or D is anybody there yet yeah okay

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,419
if if it's feasible and you won't like

00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,889
hurt anybody or break anything would you

00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,330
mind holding up your screen so that

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,380
other people in the room can see what

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,630
your screen looks like yeah okay so oh

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,370
you converted yeah okay so the white

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,750
screen that's that she clicked thank you

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,210
for your click thank you very much

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:10,240
appreciate that everyone else we see

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:14,080
orange we see red we see purple we see

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,600
blue right kind of a stupid test but

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,000
like that what we just did was we all

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,220
just got we say bucketed or kind of

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,010
channeled into a specific experience in

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,350
a test and so the two things I want to

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,600
call out are number one as a visitor

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,210
just as a single person in this

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,430
experience that's the only experience

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,800
you see right if you navigate somewhere

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,030
else and then come back to the page

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,310
you're going to see that same color that

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,540
you just saw close the window open it

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,710
back up come back you're going to see

00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,630
the same color like that is your

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,650
experience that sticks with you it's

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,669
kind of a per visitor experience thing

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,130
but from the point of the view of

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,810
someone who's running the test so me and

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,310
now y'all because I've kind of lifted

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,669
the veil right and talked about this

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,610
test I can measure the results from all

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,740
of you in aggregate across the variation

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,900
so I can go say okay how many purple

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,210
people clicked all right what about

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,250
orange people how many and so on and so

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,410
forth and so it's happening in real time

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,820
it's happening simultaneously but it's

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,060
random and it's distributed across the

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,130
room so maybe a third thing I call out

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,860
is that this happens to you all the time

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,169
right this was staged and it was made

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,970
really obvious by bright shiny colors so

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,910
you can see like oh yeah she got purple

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,610
cool when you go to Facebook when you go

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,849
to Google when you go to Amazon you're

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:36,159
in potentially dozens of tests at any

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,080
given moment you don't know because you

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,120
have nothing to compare it to because it

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,219
sticks to you it stays consistent when

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,410
you come back but they're running tons

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,150
and tons of tests all the time and

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,160
they're measuring the same thing does

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,390
she Add to Cart does she purchase does

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,260
he stay on the site long or whatever

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:55,089
they've decided makes them money so not

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,910
a novel experience just novel in it

00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,899
simple

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,570
maybe you're in tests everywhere you go

00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:05,000
all right so I just showed you a test

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,890
was the first test I've talked about it

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,839
was a terrible test so I kind of need to

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,600
call that out like let's let's not let

00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,579
that stand having kind of defined what a

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,579
test is and what you need for it just to

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:18,200
recap it needs to measure something that

00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:21,589
matters something that makes you money

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,089
or that you really care about and it

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:25,519
needs to have enough traffic and

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,800
conversion so right there I've measured

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,339
your clicks on that little click here

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,250
link on the page I don't make money from

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:37,910
that so that was kind of a bad idea

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,860
right traffic and conversions so there's

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,390
no possible way I'm going to get 500

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,440
clicks out of this room even though

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,470
you've all been really really

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,360
cooperative and I appreciate it so not a

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,339
great test in that sense and then

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,170
actionable results I have to be able to

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,850
take whatever results I'm collecting

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,550
from this experiment and I have to be

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,230
able to do something based on it I

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,000
cannot do that here right what what what

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,540
could I possibly learn like purple is

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,160
slightly better than blue yay so you

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,329
just saw a test you experienced a test

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,940
you saw from the inside on the outside

00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:09,140
but it wasn't a great test so we're

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,850
gonna move on and look at some great

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,440
tests so you can see what those look

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:17,000
like because otherwise I'll be doing you

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:20,990
a terrible disservice all right so we

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,060
covered the what of a/b testing take a

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,560
quick breather and I just want to say if

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,779
this is where you're at like if this is

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,240
your mind state right now it is okay

00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:31,399
like let's just write it out let's just

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,660
roll with it there is a lot going on

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,670
there's a lot of technical stuff to

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,800
think about there's a lot of statistical

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,890
complexity that I've so far shielded you

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,660
from but like it gets deep and so if

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,730
you're a little bit overwhelmed or

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,829
confused like please don't worry we'll

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,750
step through a couple good examples I'll

00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:50,089
walk you through how I set up that test

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,949
will talk about the landscape of tooling

00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,480
and stuff like that and then I want to

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:56,240
have plenty of time for questions so

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,140
just stay with me it's okay this stuff

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,269
gets hard but now we'll talk about why

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,160
so I'll give you a few reasons why you

00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:06,320
should run a/b tests on your website

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,850
this is the first one okay without a

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,140
doubt and this I mean hopefully this is

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:15,730
enough for some of you

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:20,060
so the year is 2008 a simpler time

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,680
this is Obama's landing page I think we

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,240
can assume that I mean not Obama

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,100
personally like logged into Google

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,079
AdWords but you know he's got help they

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,970
are buying clicks they're buying clicks

00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:32,180
for people to land on this page probably

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,800
social to paid social and organic social

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,709
any way we can like let's send them all

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,490
here because we want their so quick

00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:42,860
pause audience participation time what

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,570
is the conversion event that is valuable

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,529
that's going on on this page like what

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,120
yes signups yeah exactly right

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,730
I don't know if anybody was in the

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,220
presentation yesterday about video using

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,010
video but or if you were in the one just

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,450
now to talk about funnels these people

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,890
are very top of funnel they're just

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,160
aware they're interested they're like

00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,690
okay who's this Obama guy and so you

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,950
can't just say give me money no one's

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,959
going to give him money on this page

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,490
right he wants the email it's gonna send

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,579
out campaigns and eventually they're

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,470
gonna donate and so more signups more

00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,750
people receiving the campaigns more

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,310
donations he might even win the 2008

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,029
election if he can get this right y'all

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,709
edge of your seats yeah right okay so

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,740
this is an experiment a real experiment

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:30,230
that really happened and there are two

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,690
different elements on the page that are

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,790
under tests that are being swapped out

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,890
with variations so that we can measure

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,500
the effectiveness of them so first is

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,630
the media the the little hero image call

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,019
it hero some people know that words some

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,170
don't

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,459
don't sweat it and then a button

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,899
specifically the button text all right

00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,699
so that's that's what we're here playing

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,829
with right we're gonna change those up

00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:54,890
just like I changed up a red background

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,870
to a purple background to not much

00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,800
effect we're gonna change these up to

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,730
huge effect

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,610
so first round here's four buttons for

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,220
button copy variations all right so

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,380
everybody go ahead and pick a winner

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,890
it's cool it's like Vegas think about

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,910
what you think is going to work best you

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,040
don't have to tell anyone

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,250
by the way I've done enough of these and

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,069
been wrong so many times y'all so many

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,940
times that I no longer pick winners I no

00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,770
longer have an append

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,600
what's gonna go well and what's not I

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,700
just I had to give up to protect my

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,840
fragile ego but like it is fun to kind

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,990
of play around with it so go ahead and

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,030
pick what you think yeah good all right

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:38,120
so next for that that creative image

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:41,000
right that media up at the top three

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,590
different static images and a video

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,050
background like a kind of you know no

00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:48,470
sound autoplay video background thing

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:51,190
that you see a lot of this one didn't

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,200
win I mean the video didn't win and a

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,780
quick tip generally speaking a static

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,300
image does perform better than a video

00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,430
in that location on a page you don't

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,780
know till you test it but when I see

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,940
that it's one of the first things I want

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:09,350
to test because I've seen a static image

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,630
outperform lots of times so you only

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,340
have to choose from amongst three images

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:17,150
you've got those four buttons so that's

00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,210
12 possible combinations so someone in

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:22,460
this room is probably gonna get it right

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,500
alright we're ready we're ready yeah can

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,070
you feel the suspense it's getting warm

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,850
in here

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:32,480
alright boom okay so anybody get it

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:34,570
right yeah way to go okay so you have a

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:40,900
future in a/b testing and optimization

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:43,730
congratulation okay so the family image

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,130
with the largely white background the

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,200
learn more button so out of all those

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,410
combinations they tested this one had

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,260
40% forty point six percent higher

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,720
signups than the original and if you

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,640
kind of math it out and just have to use

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,770
a little bit of good faith involved in

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,510
this math but if you multiply that by

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,490
how many people were hitting the page

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,990
that's how many more signups if you

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,600
multiply that by how much average

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,220
donation was purse I know it's a ton of

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,960
money alright so like we're in the Y

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,880
section right now right why should you

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,430
care why do you want to do this maybe

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:21,140
some time for some site it's because

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:24,290
you'll make sixty million dollars yeah

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,000
good one right I know yeah okay but you

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:30,440
know Obama did and we know how that went

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,170
so a to generalize if you apply this

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,910
methodology if you do it over time it

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,560
won't be the first test it won't be all

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,279
in one test but if you keep

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,410
experimenting

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,569
optimizing your site in this way you

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,579
will increase conversions and that I

00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:48,079
assume is something you care about or

00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:51,439
your clients care about here's some more

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,300
kind of glory stories about a/b test

00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:54,769
successes from awhile around the web

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,269
there's a million of them I went and

00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:58,269
just pulled a few screenshots out

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,209
$106,000 increase in monthly revenue I

00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,579
take some of these with a grain of salt

00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:11,029
but like I wrote this one so I guess I

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:13,009
believe this one depending on the scale

00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,779
of the business depending on I guess how

00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:17,629
much room for improvement there is

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:19,670
there's a lot of money to be made and so

00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:23,149
you want to do this because you will

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:25,370
make more money doing it and then a

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,439
final reason is if you're thinking about

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,779
something like a big redesign if you're

00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:31,370
thinking about an entire repositioning

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,529
of your product line something risky

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,069
like that that could potentially make

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,449
people angry make people go away forever

00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:40,160
testing it first instead of just rolling

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:44,689
it out and hoping for the best

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:48,050
is a way to take that risk away so the

00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:50,420
top two images these are kind of like I

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,149
don't know low-key famous disastrous

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:57,319
redesigns that happened Marks and

00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:58,670
Spencers British retailer lost a ton of

00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,290
money because they redesigned their

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,540
website and they rolled it out and it

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,270
sucked

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:08,390
Digg I was a thing and no longer is

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,429
cautionary tale I guess right so here's

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,169
a more recent one right Instagram I

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,500
don't know if anybody remembers for a

00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:17,569
minute Instagram had this new UI where I

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,270
think you had to like swipe instead of

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,730
scroll or something like that it rolled

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,829
out for maybe a few hours and the

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:28,399
internet went crazy like what is this

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:30,950
you know and it was over as fast as it

00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:33,230
happened right and so like depending on

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,620
whose story you believe either this was

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,240
a bug or it was a test that went out to

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,890
more people than it was meant to go out

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,710
to or whatever but the point being like

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,539
nice recovery right this I have to

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,669
believe was implemented as an experiment

00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:48,049
so that when people started tweeting

00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:49,980
about how much they hated the new UI

00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:51,179
they just press a button you

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,720
press a button it's over it's like oh

00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,980
it's kidney alright so I mean imagine if

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,870
they just rolled this out to production

00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,760
and had fumbled around for days or weeks

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,380
being like we're working on remote like

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,760
it would have been a disaster right so

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,700
this is a way to roll stuff like that

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,290
out and even if it's terrible I mean I

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,510
don't know people still use Instagram

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:13,980
right so they survive that all right so

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,900
now we'll dig into how how do you do

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,299
this I assume most everyone in this room

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,880
has some level of control over some

00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,740
website somewhere and I don't know how

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,600
excited you it's like afternoon and it's

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,400
warm in here so I can't tell if

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,260
anybody's pumped up or not but like I'm

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,610
just gonna assume you might want to do

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,760
this yourself let's talk about what that

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,890
entails getting started not super

00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,240
complicated there's a lot of lot of

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,340
helpful tools out there you don't have

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,080
to have a degree in stats you don't have

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,760
to be a developer either so I'll show

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,910
you how to set up the test that we did a

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,270
demo of alright so I used Google

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,860
optimized for that test and I will I'm

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,390
gonna go ahead and say that if you are

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,190
new to this and you want to try it out

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,190
you should just use Google optimized

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,120
it's free it's pretty easy it's well

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:02,100
documented

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,540
it's battle tested and so why not we'll

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,860
talk about other alternatives in a bit

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,549
but I'm just going to go ahead and put

00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:10,910
my stamp of approval on this one for now

00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:13,169
all right so you need to install it so

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,820
what that involves is you go to google

00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,410
optimize and you click a button and you

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,260
create an account and you all know how

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,660
to do that I'm sure and then you click

00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,700
another button to create a container

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,980
which is just like a project that kind

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,350
of houses your site because you can have

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,520
multiple containers if you have multiple

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,220
sites you could be running a hundred

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,900
experiments and you're awesome but for

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,740
your first one you set that up and then

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,549
they're going to give you a little

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:40,200
script so this tag right up here and one

00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:41,970
nice thing about Google optimizes it

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,640
integrates with analytics with Google

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,799
Analytics and so this snippet will

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,690
actually replace your Google Analytics

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,110
snippet if you've already got one

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:55,010
it's just both rolled into one so you

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,299
got to put this onto your website

00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,240
technically any page where you want to

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:01,830
either be running an experiment or you

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,100
want to be collecting data like

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,980
measuring convert

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,080
but ideally and most simply just

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,450
everywhere just put it into the very top

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:22,210
of the head tag of every page on your

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:24,490
site sir so the question is if we have a

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,289
multiple containers multiple sites I'm

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,440
assuming how do we bring them together

00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:32,440
so the short answer is like you can do

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,230
whatever you need if you have multiple

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,529
sites and you want to run the same test

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,870
across those sites then you can just use

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,929
this same tag on the multiple sites and

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,370
that's all you have to do but if you

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:47,320
have separate sites that you want to

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,120
keep separate separate check tracking

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,860
separate experiments you want to keep

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,889
them kind of separate that's two

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,509
containers two tags yeah cool thanks

00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:57,220
thanks for the question oh well actually

00:20:55,509 --> 00:21:00,159
so while we're on questions I'll turn

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,909
one around to y'all I mentioned that

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,799
this needs to be at the top of the head

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:09,009
on every page on your site at the top of

00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,870
the head anybody any dev people out here

00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:12,690
want a hazard a guess as to why it has

00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,700
to go way up on the top of the webpage

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,889
why this snippet this one special

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:22,779
snippet can't go down at the bottom of

00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:25,059
the body like so many others do sir yeah

00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,919
yeah why does it need he said it needs

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:30,659
to load before the website which is true

00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,659
and why is that why do we need this one

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:36,399
so yeah so in case somebody clicks on

00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:38,789
something before it loads you wouldn't

00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:41,440
track it and along those same lines

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:43,090
we're using this to change the page

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,460
right we're using this to like swap out

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:49,090
text or change an image or whatever kind

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,769
of stuff and so if this comes in slow if

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,669
this comes in two seconds after page

00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,320
load they're gonna see your original

00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:54,850
page and that's gonna be like we're just

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,759
kidding and show you the new page and

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,350
like you think that's gonna win like do

00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:03,340
you think that experience is a better

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,809
experience so your test is stupid and

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,210
you should feel bad and so no so this

00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:09,309
has to go at the top of the page almost

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,500
every other tag on your site can go

00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:12,909
wherever and you probably should load

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,590
them later but this is a special one

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:16,250
yeah cuz you're cuz you're trying to

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,780
measure every single interaction

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,429
for the accuracy of your data and

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,750
because you're rewriting stuff like

00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:26,840
before people can see it so I have a

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,720
theme that has a header scripts little

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,299
customization module here so I just

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,370
pasted mine in here but depending on

00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:36,020
what your site looks like you can you

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,120
know if you're super hacker can just go

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,120
edit the theme file directly or whatever

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:45,380
or there's plenty of plugins that let

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:48,260
you inject scripts CSS j/s whatever into

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:57,559
whatever part of the page you want yeah

00:22:48,260 --> 00:23:03,080
I hmm a theme or plugin a specific theme

00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:04,220
theme mmm no there's no particular

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,470
themes the question is there a theme you

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:11,929
would recommend for for the purpose of

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:14,870
a/b testing or yeah I would say

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:16,520
absolutely not no opinion whatever theme

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,710
you're working with for whatever reason

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,720
you chose it is perfectly fine and

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,090
worst-case you install one plug-in and

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,010
you paste in one tag to inject in the

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,360
header and you're good to go and you

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,880
didn't have to touch anything else

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,980
I picked my theme just on aesthetics and

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,669
it kind of does what I'm wanting it to

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,190
do but I've injected this into probably

00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,960
half a dozen different themes and even

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,730
if you coded your own and it's janky as

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,260
can be you can still find a way to get

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:47,090
it in there so yeah no no restrictions

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:49,039
there it's not a plug-in no it's a it's

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,100
just a separate I guess standalone app

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,900
just like Google Analytics you go log in

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:59,720
and look at stuff it's very similar to

00:23:53,900 --> 00:24:06,289
that so they share a snippet I guess and

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:08,809
they integrate that's right if you have

00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:10,309
the Google Analytics snippet already

00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:11,059
installed on your site which you should

00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:12,950
good for you

00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:14,270
then when you go set up optimize and

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,280
they give you that snippet that snippet

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,809
is going to overwrite the Google

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,179
Analytics snippet that's your new Google

00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:22,900
Analytics and optimize snippet I'll be

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:22,900
right with you yes ma'am

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,500
[Music]

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,480
okay good question

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,310
no no no I got you I think I think so um

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,660
yeah this question is so you say you

00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,730
want to have two different home pages

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,890
right we looked at an example where it

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,420
changed the background of a single page

00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,190
and then we looked at an example where

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,290
Obama was changing out an image and a

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,870
button on a single page you can also

00:24:54,290 --> 00:25:00,020
totally test entire pages against entire

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,580
pages so if you want to do that the

00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,080
first answer about the snippet she is

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,600
asking do you like the snippet on both

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,340
pages absolutely yeah you should shoot

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,200
to have the snippet on every page and

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,620
that's why using a plug-in or a theme

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,880
kind of box like I showed that's the way

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,100
to get that done and then it'll just be

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,930
on every page and then as far as how do

00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,780
you do it like page against page what's

00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:23,030
that look like yeah you would set up the

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,310
new page and then your experiment

00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:28,130
instead of changing elements on the page

00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:30,800
it would just redirect to the new page

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,200
50% of people or whatever fraction will

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,730
get redirected to your new page and then

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,940
you're just measuring everything from

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:43,310
that point forward yeah yeah cause like

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,960
the the snippet we should get it back up

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,630
here because there's so much going on in

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,730
this little line of code this snippet

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,110
like what happens this this is good I

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,330
don't know if there will be an interest

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,950
in this level of detail but like

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,630
somebody goes in their browser they type

00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,330
in your website address they hit enter

00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,370
right and then it pulls in that HTML and

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,860
then way up at the top of that HTML is

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,990
the script and so the script is pulling

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,420
down the Google optimized script and

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,310
that scripts got all the logic for all

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,040
of your tests and all of your tracking

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,840
and all the stuff that you've set up

00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,250
inside the Google optimized UI when you

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,620
were logged in and creating things which

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,420
we will see in a minute but it's pulling

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,030
it all that logic and like running it on

00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,470
your page and so that's how that goes

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,120
down so whether it's changed my button

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,740
whether it's redirect whether it's

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,810
listen for this click like all of that

00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,990
stuff is happening on the page in their

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:35,940
browser do they that's your question

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:38,430
mm-hmm yeah yeah and it's doing a lot of

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:52,350
stuff that's free is there a question

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:56,160
over here that I skipped over yes you do

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,570
I'm sorry yeah yeah I mean well what it

00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,180
means if you don't is you'll have

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:02,820
analytics installed twice on your site

00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,380
and I want to say that could lead us to

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,260
the point where we don't trust our data

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,400
and now we're just wasting our time

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,110
because we're looking at data that we

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,850
can't act on and that's that's really

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,100
common but I don't want that to happen

00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:25,830
to anyone in this room ever so yeah you

00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:26,340
do have to take it up sir yeah yeah good

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,870
question

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,390
it's asking about the randomization

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,370
right like the first time somebody hits

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,020
the page we ran experiments running they

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,580
get randomly assigned to one of the

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,470
experiences so how does that work like

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,900
how does that get handled yes exactly

00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,820
that's handled by Google optimize it's

00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,470
just a quick think of it like a coin

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,170
toss right it's like you visit the page

00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,880
and Google optimize runs up at the very

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,980
top before you even see anything and

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,780
it's like have I seen her before don't

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,460
recognize her all right let me see

00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,440
eeny meeny miny moe I'm gonna show you

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,660
this one and then from there it's gonna

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,370
set a cookie so that the next time you

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,050
come back it's like oh you again here

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,880
you go here's Moe right just like you

00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:07,400
saw last time so that's how that works

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,400
and it's handled for you sir

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:21,190
I love this question so much okay so the

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,270
question is is it better to test one

00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:27,100
thing at a time so you know what was how

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,600
to attribute I guess the any sort of

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,370
improvement that you saw right what was

00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,860
responsible was that the image was at

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,650
the button what was it I'm gonna try to

00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,290
give a quick answer now and then we can

00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,880
go deeper on this probably in just a bit

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,280
I think I've got some slides at the end

00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,750
that we might reference because I think

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,570
a more general question there is like

00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,100
what should I test which is a question

00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,410
people usually have right what should I

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,330
test how big a thing how many things so

00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:56,080
I do want to approach that but the short

00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:59,350
answer is my stance is thanks 30 minutes

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,860
show is you you'll you'll never really

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:05,590
know that much about why one thing is

00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,900
better than another and so I prefer to

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,000
focus on what we do know which is hey

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,330
this works better and now where can we

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,550
go from here and so I don't think too

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:19,350
much about necessarily isolating the

00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:22,090
source of an improvement early on early

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,950
tests I think it's good to test wildly

00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,660
crazily different changes against each

00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,990
other to cover as much ground as you can

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:31,570
like imagine every possible incarnation

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,060
of your site that's feasible that like

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,100
wouldn't be insane and throw as many

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,210
variations out there as you can and so

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,350
when you get a winner like you won't

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,050
know ok well this has a different design

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,640
it's a longer form the copy is a little

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,160
different I've got these images like you

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,210
will have no idea so I guess this was

00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,180
supposed to be a short answer it's not

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,130
going that way number one get used to

00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,960
not knowing it get comfortable with not

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,280
really knowing and just kind of focused

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,470
on what you're learning and what you can

00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,690
do next

00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,010
later in the optimization program when

00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,710
you figure out which parts of the site

00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:05,320
really have high impact then you can do

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,030
more minut changes and then you'll have

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,180
a stronger sense of okay here's here's

00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:12,490
kind of what's behind that change early

00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,260
on big swings and don't worry about it

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:18,490
is my short answer well we will come

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,560
back to this cool ok and just to check

00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,120
in we're about 30 minutes in I'm hoping

00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,779
for lots of questions I appreciate the

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,889
questions so far

00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:26,599
I'm just gonna step through what it

00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:29,599
looked like to set up that little orange

00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:32,419
red blue purple test and then we'll be

00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:35,690
on to questions so that's that's what's

00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:37,909
ahead everybody so okay so having

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,320
installed that snippet on my site and I

00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:40,639
love the questions about how the snippet

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,169
works like you should be asking those

00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:47,119
questions so thank you click a button to

00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:48,979
create an experience I think they call

00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,259
it experience not experiment because you

00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:52,909
can also do personalization stuff with

00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,279
Google optimize it's a lot of the same

00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:57,710
like under the hood the technology is

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:01,039
the same and then you click a button to

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:04,039
add a variant and so once you got a

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,950
variant you can click a button to edit

00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:08,690
the variant and so this Park and of fun

00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,359
honor how many people in the room are

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,940
not developers not developers many

00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:17,359
people ok great are not developers so

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:21,769
good news for y'all the way it looks to

00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:23,210
build out a variation there's only so

00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:25,789
much you can do but there's a good bit

00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,679
that you can do without writing code so

00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:31,039
it's going to pop open your web page in

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,659
the browser kind of framed around with

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,820
this little google optimized stuff you

00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:38,269
see that at the top that's an overlay

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,979
and there's a Chrome extension that you

00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:43,700
install that kind of facilitates that

00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:44,929
also free no worries and then it's got a

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,299
little widget that lets you modify

00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:50,330
things on the page so you can change the

00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:52,190
styles you can rewrite the HTML or the

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,929
copy or whatever so any kind of change

00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,580
like that like the Obama changes you

00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:59,659
could build a google optimized no

00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:01,249
developer needed for example the way it

00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:02,839
works is you kind of hover over elements

00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:05,389
on the page and you click and then at

00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,519
the top see if it says body it's got a

00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:09,799
red box around it I've selected the body

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,599
just the whole body of the page and then

00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:14,059
in the widget I've selected background

00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,919
and I just type orange a hit enter and

00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,080
like that's that's it that's that's my

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,669
test like there we go y'all are everyone

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,619
who saw orange this is the magic behind

00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:24,049
it amazing right

00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:26,809
for those of you who are developers or

00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:29,989
work with developers you can also inject

00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:32,690
custom CSS and custom JavaScript into

00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:35,419
any variation so there's literally

00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,900
nothing you can't do sky's the limit you

00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:39,059
can rebuild the entire page

00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,650
you can call api's you can build out new

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:45,120
functionality if you want to go down

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:46,620
that route it supports that so we

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,940
created a variant we're gonna add some

00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,980
more we're going to make them different

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,870
colors and then we have to figure out

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,600
what we're measuring always important

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,190
right so you can do this too within

00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,930
google optimize all this is like I'm

00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,210
logged in to Google optimized right and

00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,820
this is what I'm seeing so create a

00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:05,280
custom objective you can also use goals

00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,290
from Google Analytics if you've already

00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,080
set up goals in Google Analytics they'll

00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:12,150
just kind of magically appear and so I

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,800
set this one up to measure that you just

00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,290
converted page that some of you saw

00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,120
those of you who could not resist the

00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,400
draw of that click here right you just

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,170
had it yet y'all saw this page and it

00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,090
measured that page view and it

00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,710
attributed it back to whichever

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,320
experience you were in whichever

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:30,390
variation you saw and it's like BAM

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,790
purple got a winner and it's counting

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,650
them up in the background and then it's

00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,770
oh I'm a little bit ahead of myself

00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:39,780
there you press a button to launch and

00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:42,630
like freak out a little bit you know

00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,760
it's fine go hit your site several times

00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,140
in incognito and close it out and hit it

00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,400
an incognito and close it out you'll see

00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,470
the variations you can make sure

00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:54,500
nothing's broken and then you're just

00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:56,880
tracking so kind of a mess you know

00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,679
everybody okay still looking at this

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,600
anybody sweating it now okay

00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,600
yes ma'am yeah

00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,659
yeah

00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:21,919
yeah yeah absolutely so the question is

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,450
yeah can you do you can test a page

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,520
against a page can you test multiple

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,679
pages against multiple pages the answer

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,419
is yes yeah for sure and you should if

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,980
you can like if you have the numbers if

00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:33,260
you have the traffic you should test

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,360
more without a doubt and so yeah

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,090
absolutely and you just have variant one

00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,460
is my home page variant one home page

00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,770
variant two all the way down to five or

00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,640
six is a good number if you can support

00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,640
it yeah

00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:11,300
sure sure yeah yeah yeah good question

00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,130
so the question is about okay so we're

00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,500
doing like a big enterprise corporate

00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,390
redesign if we mess this up we getting a

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,180
whole lot of trouble lots of eyes on it

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,220
like how do we contain that how do we QA

00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,780
that how do we make sure that people

00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,240
only see it when we want them to and so

00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,070
absolutely I kind of skipped over it but

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,190
when you're setting up your experiment

00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:32,960
you have really specific choices you can

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,300
make about the targeting like where does

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,890
this run and so I just chose one page

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,500
because it's just running on that one

00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:42,170
page that I sent everybody to but you

00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:45,470
can give it like a URL pattern so you

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:47,540
could say only run on staging mysite.com

00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:50,570
and it would never reach the production

00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,040
site and it gets even more nuanced than

00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,020
that too so you have a lot of choices

00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,120
with like where the test runs

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,460
you can also target only for people who

00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:02,870
have like a query parameter so like

00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:04,040
question mark QA equals true and so like

00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,140
you know nobody's coming to your site

00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,030
with that in the URL string except you

00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,010
so there's all kinds of ways to kind of

00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,720
scope it down and control who sees it

00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,100
yeah and and yeah yeah that's really

00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,160
important too yeah you don't just press

00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,470
go even though I just said press go all

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,210
right so what we have here is this is a

00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,070
different result set this is from the

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:24,170
Google optimized Docs I don't have all

00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:27,980
these results for what y'all just saw so

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:29,270
sorry for each experience there's a lot

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,160
of stuff here I'm just going to kind of

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,110
hone on to this graph which is a good

00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,840
thing to look at it's going to give you

00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:38,750
your metric on the y-axis and then time

00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,150
on the x-axis and what we're looking for

00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:44,900
generally is for these lines to kind of

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:46,550
just settle down and steady out a thing

00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,620
to pay attention to is like look at this

00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:51,140
hot mess early on where everything's

00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:54,350
jumping around like that if you had just

00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,730
called the test right here then you

00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,010
would have called this blue line that

00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,480
was at the top but we gave it time and

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,940
we saw that actually another variation

00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,650
was outperforming that and so this is

00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,010
kind of where we come back to that 500

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,290
like you need those 500 conversions for

00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,510
this noise to kind of settle down if

00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:14,150
you're making a call on only a hundred

00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,160
conversions worth of data you might be

00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,710
making the call all the way over here

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,900
and

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,339
wrong right or over here and you're

00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,619
wrong and so you put all this effort

00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:24,119
into building this test and UQ ate it

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,560
and you launched it and you watch the

00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,810
results and you thought you had a winner

00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,540
and you're wrong so I don't want that to

00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,220
happen to you and so that's why you need

00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,320
to have a sense of okay do I have enough

00:37:32,220 --> 00:38:03,270
traffic do I have enough data to make

00:37:34,320 --> 00:38:05,970
this call oh yes yeah yeah good question

00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:08,280
so she's saying it's is it important

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,410
that your sample is representative of

00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,480
the total population absolutely if you

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,550
make the disserve a test to just a

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,410
handful of people or even worse just to

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,330
a narrow segment of your audience and

00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,099
you get a win and you're like yeah let's

00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:23,430
roll it out yeah that's potentially

00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:24,930
really disastrous for sure so if you

00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,820
don't want to serve it to all visitors

00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,640
at once because it's something sensitive

00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,720
you could serve it to a fraction but

00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,390
that'll be a fraction of the whole

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,000
population right like a random fraction

00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:38,010
so 10 percent of all visitors right you

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,560
don't just serve it to people who come

00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,930
in on a Friday or just people on mobile

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,210
necessarily if it's relevant on desktop

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:49,290
yeah you want a representative sample

00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:51,510
yeah yeah yeah you can control how much

00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,760
of the total population is in the test

00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,390
is a that's a little toggle you've got

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,390
sir

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,790
yeah absolutely so I just said okay

00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,470
careful about only testing on mobile but

00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,990
he has a good point can you just test on

00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,190
mobile if it's only a test for mobile if

00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,320
it's only about the mobile experience

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,380
and yeah for sure you can target by

00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,860
device and the point there is if you get

00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,240
a winner

00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,160
you're only gonna roll that winner out

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,840
on mobile and so you're good right

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,970
because you have tested a representative

00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,320
sample of that audience so yeah and you

00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:33,220
do have that capability

00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:36,250
yeah good questions okay not a lot of

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:38,170
time I would like to kind of go through

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:41,080
this quickly I just want to call out

00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:43,390
that if anybody read the blurb for this

00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,980
talk that you've so graciously attended

00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,450
I said I was going to talk about a

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,000
solution that's fully integrated into

00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:51,369
WordPress so like real quick story there

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,800
months ago when I signed up for this I

00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:55,390
just had a like a prospect that I was

00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,340
chasing tell me like we don't need your

00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:00,160
help we're using element or anybody

00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,140
element or yeah and there's a there's a

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,210
plugin called split test for Elementor

00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,619
and it's super easy and like we're good

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,280
but thanks for asking and I was like

00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:08,500
okay cool

00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,150
so you know for this talk let me go

00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,010
learn that plug-in and I'll do a little

00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:15,609
demo and that'll be cool forward camp

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:18,310
right so this was the plug-in and this

00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:22,390
is me trying to set up y'all's demo with

00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:23,680
that plug-in and so like I'm whatever

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,900
like not throwing shade

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,490
right it could be user error but I could

00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,040
not get it to work this is my support

00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:33,010
ticket so we're not going to talk about

00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,420
that plug-in today if anybody wants to

00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,190
know how it plays out like get in touch

00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,820
I'll be happy to fill you in haven't

00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,790
heard back yet

00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,140
I looked at a few other plugins and I

00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,150
didn't really see anything that I

00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,220
thought was a better idea than optical

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:48,270
optimized like these ones they look okay

00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:51,040
but either not updated for four years or

00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,660
like a hundred plus installations so

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,450
like I mean it looks really good but not

00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,970
clearly not like road-tested there's a

00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,680
couple others you have to pay for and I

00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,390
you know for something that you're

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,369
uncertain about that you have to pay for

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,560
I would just go with the free thing that

00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:07,960
has a lot of support that's just me so I

00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,240
I didn't bring that to you there are a

00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,340
ton of options out there as far as a/b

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,440
testing platforms feel free to explore

00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,040
but I'm telling you that the free one

00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,230
that's supported by a giant come

00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,970
Bini that's being used on websites all

00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:23,810
over the place is good enough to get

00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:27,260
started and you can you know make a

00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:29,840
choice as you go along so got some

00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,600
resources here that you can refer to if

00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:36,650
you're into this stuff and then I've

00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:38,810
also got the next slide a page wait for

00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,820
photos but then if you want the actual I

00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:43,420
clickable links I'll make sure those get

00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,420
to you too

00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:52,220
good good

00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:53,780
click click snap snap yeah okay actually

00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,980
I should have probably just done this in

00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,580
made y'all take this picture instead

00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:00,890
this is this is a link this this page

00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,450
has a link to the slide so you can get

00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,860
all those links that you just saw I'm

00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,620
sorry oh there's a lot of pressure up

00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:09,500
here right hot in here right anyway so

00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,880
this is resources it'll link you out to

00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:17,710
the things you just saw onto the slides

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,710
themselves thank you for coming sir yeah

00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:24,610
yeah

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:42,119
mm-hmm yeah yeah okay so a good question

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,220
with two questions kind of like one was

00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,750
about the the 500 conversions number

00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,670
right I didn't say visitors

00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:50,430
I said conversions so like what's up

00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:52,380
with that and then also sites where one

00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:55,730
of the main conversions is to make a

00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:58,230
phone call how do you handle that so

00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,809
second question first if the phone call

00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,400
is your conversion act you can always

00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:03,660
measure that click right that's that's

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,759
fairly straightforward to measure a

00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:09,359
click on the phone phone number on the

00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:11,250
site but call rail be reused call rail

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,170
or her to call rail they're right down

00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,900
the street local company and they do

00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:18,750
some pretty fancy magical stuff where

00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,849
when the page loads they swap out the

00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,680
phone number with like a redirect phone

00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,630
number and then they can track it back

00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,480
to that visitor even back to that ad

00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:30,210
campaign and so when the call comes in

00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,059
they send an event through to Google

00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,710
Analytics and I'm assuming optimized and

00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:37,799
so you can actually track like down to

00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:39,390
the not sure how much it costs good

00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:40,740
question I've only used it where other

00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,259
people were paying for it but it's

00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,670
something worth looking into and I don't

00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:46,589
I'm not sure of an intermediate solution

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,109
there though otherwise you're kind of

00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:56,250
just stuck measuring the clicks as far

00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:57,390
as I know right you can carry it out but

00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,640
if you carry it out more than a couple

00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,289
months it just gets to the point where

00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,750
do we trust this this has been running

00:44:01,289 --> 00:44:06,089
so long has seasonality and whatnot

00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,730
effected what's good the goal is to have

00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:09,900
data that you can act on and so if it

00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,579
runs too long and you stopped trusting

00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,829
the data you wasted your time so yeah

00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:16,220
that's why it's a rule of thumb yeah are

00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:16,220
we a time

00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:28,750
yeah good question do you need google

00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,660
analytics before you do google optimize

00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:34,180
I will say yeah technically you can do

00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,770
it without Google Analytics you can use

00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,990
it as a standalone and just measure

00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:44,050
goals within Google optimize I would say

00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:45,580
just go do it if you haven't yeah you

00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:47,320
can set up a goal as part of your

00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,820
experiment you can do little one-off

00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,650
goals for that matter but if you're

00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,260
going to start investing time and energy

00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,000
into running these experiments it's

00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,920
worth the set up to have that analytics

00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,340
install too so not a requirement strong

00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:10,720
recommendation yeah good question sir

00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:12,640
your with you oh yeah sure yeah okay so

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,950
like you like you want to sell a be

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,550
testing to a client potentially yeah

00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:20,410
sure absolutely um number of options so

00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,970
I mean you could just charge hourly this

00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,650
is a premium service right like we're

00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,020
talking there's the web development

00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,060
there's UX strategy there's design

00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:30,580
there's data analysis so you know like

00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:33,460
hike your prices for that a lot of

00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:36,910
agencies charge on a tests per month

00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:40,390
basis so we will build and run two to

00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:42,760
three tests a month for five to ten

00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:45,100
thousand dollars a month and depending

00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,640
on your client base that number could go

00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:50,590
up I wouldn't take it down much it's

00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,360
gonna be hard to deliver at a profit for

00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:56,500
much less than that but does that help

00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,850
as a range oh how much do you get

00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,720
upfront yeah I mean I don't know like

00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:04,150
all of it ideally but yeah that's that's

00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,930
a whole nother talk right yeah yeah

00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,250
absolutely

00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,340
yeah so you had a question I'll be right

00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,340
back

00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,449
[Music]

00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:39,810
[Music]

00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:42,120
yeah yeah exactly

00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,710
I actually literally have that in feel

00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,910
like appendix slides okay so the

00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,770
question is like isn't there is there a

00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:48,360
sweet spot for how long you run the test

00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,550
cuz if you call it after two days you

00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,740
probably just jump in after shadows and

00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,090
making a decision based on noise but if

00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,590
you run it for if you run it for like

00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,780
six months I mean do you even believe

00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:59,550
that this test means anything anymore

00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,260
after six months that's too long six

00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,330
months is too long I'll say it and so

00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,490
absolutely there's a sweet spot and it

00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:07,200
you kind of just math it out and there's

00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,270
these calculators all over the interwebs

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,110
if you go to the link to the slides

00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:16,740
there's a link to this calculator this

00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:18,330
is the this is the V W Oh a B test

00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,100
calculator and there's a link to it in

00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:22,830
the slides and so what's your conversion

00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,180
rate how many daily visitors which you

00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,130
know that's just a function of your

00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:29,100
monthly whatever and then it'll tell you

00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:30,930
okay with two variations it needs to run

00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:33,360
for 46 days and that's acceptable for

00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:35,060
like a low traffic site like that okay

00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,190
month and a half that's not too bad

00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:40,590
here's some different numbers much

00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:42,900
higher conversion rate much lower

00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,610
visitor count 39 days so similar

00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,620
duration right back to that question

00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:48,900
about is it about traffic or is it about

00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:50,370
conversions it mostly comes down to the

00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,560
number of conversions that will

00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:55,950
determine your test duration that and

00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:58,130
how many variations so this site cannot

00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:01,310
run five variations it'll go too long

00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:03,530
yeah good question

00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:05,420
take questions either they have do you

00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:08,170
happiness bar yeah let's do it

00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,170
sure thanks everybody

00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:14,039
