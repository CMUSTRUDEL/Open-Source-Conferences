	00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,890
so I'm I'm Aaron Campbell I'm gonna be

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:11,070
talking about how to secure your site

00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:14,759
I'm a bit of an information addict like

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,510
I love to know things and learn new

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,490
things so the Internet's kind of an

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,220
amazing place for me right I can go

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,769
there and and I feel like I can learn

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:29,970
practically anything and and I really

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:35,399
love that on a seemingly unrelated note

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:39,329
I also really enjoy fire and explosions

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,219
and in a safe kind of controlled way but

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,680
they fascinate me I very much enjoy them

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,680
which is probably why I'm like the

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,190
perfect viewer for the Mythbusters show

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,340
which I absolutely love who else loves

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,760
the Mythbusters show yes like every time

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,570
I get to learn something new or confirm

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,280
something that that I knew and and I

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,510
really enjoy it I get to see fire and

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,610
explosions while I do and over the the

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,670
last few years I've focused pretty

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:17,040
heavily on kind of the the internet

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,170
security arena and as I did one of the

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,049
things that really stood out to me is

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,470
that one of our biggest struggles in

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,189
that space isn't isn't like the most

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,310
complex hacks or even these these really

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:35,100
big things that we're seeing in the news

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,950
that are happening a lot of it comes

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,409
down to people need to have a better

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,570
understanding of how to keep themselves

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,430
secure online how to keep their own

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:50,329
website secure we all all of us have a

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,390
decent bit of learning to do around that

00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:56,700
but my first thought was that should be

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,360
easy right we have the internet we can

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,509
all just go learn that if we want to

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,719
until I tried to just go and type in how

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,569
to secure my site or how to secure my

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,039
WordPress site into Google and I just

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,860
got this mask

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,790
a flood of information plenty of

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,640
information to learn from but also

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,620
ignoring my kind of background

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,040
insecurity and trying to just look at it

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,920
and say how do I know what of this

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,890
information is actually useful and

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,569
important and what isn't this piece of

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,430
information seems like it knows what

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,349
it's talking about and then that piece

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,159
also seems like it does and contradicts

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:44,329
the first one how do we get that base

00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,959
knowledge so that we can better

00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:51,419
understand security and I immediately

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,549
thought what we need is like security

00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,560
Mythbusters like we need to look at all

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,959
these pieces of information

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,659
take these assumptions that we all have

00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,599
based on these things that we read and

00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:07,500
see if we can figure out what we can

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,109
confirm and what we can bust as myths to

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,030
help us better secure our websites and

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,970
to help us focus in on the things that

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,829
are actually useful so that's what I

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,889
want to do today is look at some of the

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:22,379
most common things that I hear and talk

00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:26,810
about whether they are actually useful

00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:30,299
or not and why the first thing is that

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,209
Security's a little scary right it's um

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,549
it's big and it's complex but it's also

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,959
so important like we understand that we

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,659
need to know more about it

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,959
but it's confusing and so we try to take

00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:45,479
it slow and easy and we're investigating

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,909
it but then at some point we do one of

00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,280
those google searches that i'm talking

00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,799
about we go and we type something in and

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,010
we think that we're getting close to

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,889
figuring it out but in reality we get

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,579
this massive dump of information and it

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,260
just freaks us out right it seems like

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,150
it's too much we're like wait maybe I

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,729
can handle this maybe I can no I can't

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:14,909
handle this like this is just too much

00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:16,620
security is scary but this is luckily

00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,229
this is one that I get to bust right

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,719
this is this is not true security

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:24,870
doesn't have to be scary

00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:26,790
this is aragón this was a family

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,490
for many years it was my son's lizard

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,260
she is a bearded dragon just like those

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,130
two lizards that were picking on that

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,320
poor little kitten in the previous video

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,410
but she's she's not scary

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,020
contrary to what that kitten thought but

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:47,460
people that came to visit us often

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,860
thought she was and my son really didn't

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,620
understand that he didn't get it at all

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,479
and I would try to explain to him that

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,000
those people were getting a different

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,150
experience meeting her at this size at

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,270
18 plus inches long is kind of a giant

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:06,030
lizard if you will then we had because

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,770
we started with Eragon we got to know

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,630
her when she was only maybe two and a

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,520
half or three inches long and would sit

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,510
in the palm of our hands and she

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,030
certainly wasn't scary then and as she

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,639
grew and we got to know her you know she

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,340
ate insects when she was very young but

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,590
eventually they become vegetarian they

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,050
eat fruits and vegetables and so like

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,919
that cat was not on the menu even though

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,200
it may have worried that it was and even

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,360
those those big spikes that you can

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,919
maybe see that look all terrifying and

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,960
scary coming out the back of her head

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,740
and protecting her neck they look

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,080
terrifying what they're actually soft

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,970
and she loved it when you would pet her

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,800
right there she would close her eyes and

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:55,050
turn her head like yes Pet me there more

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,039
but it wasn't scary because we had kind

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,360
of grown with it we had had this base

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,160
understanding of her as a lizard and

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,500
what she was and then grew with it and I

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,460
think we can do the same thing to sort

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,130
of curb the scary parts of security we

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,870
can we can get some base knowledge and

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:17,130
understanding we can focus on the easy

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,320
actionable things that we can do that

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,110
can make a big difference on our sights

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,740
and we can use that as a foundation to

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,750
help us then eventually learn more but

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,979
with a base understanding that prevents

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,500
that from being scary

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,930
it lets us better understand things as

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,080
we move forward so that's the main focus

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,870
here is as we bust some of these myths

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,290
and can

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,600
from some of these truths we can build

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,210
that base knowledge so that hopefully

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,100
everyone here will have a less scary

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:52,390
journey as they learn more about

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,890
security in the future so one of the big

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,080
assumptions one of the things that I

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,930
hear all the time about how to keep your

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,560
website safe is saying that you need to

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,150
update right we all see this all the

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,530
time you need to update and in the

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,750
WordPress space they're talking about

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,630
updating WordPress and plugins and

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,850
themes and that you can't be secure if

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:17,290
you're not constantly updating and

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:21,070
staying up to date with your software is

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:24,340
that true does that really help improve

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:26,230
the security of your site this is

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,920
participatory people like someone's got

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:34,120
a yes it is it is absolutely true this

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,850
one is confirmed updating your software

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,250
is extremely important every time that a

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,980
vulnerabilities found and people like

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,440
our WordPress security team put time and

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,080
effort into fixing it and pushing out a

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,410
release we want you to be using that

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,150
like we're trying to help secure you

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,770
plug-in authors themed authors a lot of

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,500
times they're pushing out new versions

00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,430
because they're trying to responsibly

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:03,580
fix problems but they can't help you if

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,200
you don't update but it goes even a

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,360
little further than WordPress and

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,880
plugins and themes if you're running

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,010
your own server a VPS or something and

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,290
you're not relying on your host to do it

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,220
then you also need to update whatever

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:20,860
software is running that server the web

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:24,100
server Apache or nginx in your PHP and

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,050
your database version and you should

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,210
also be updating the software on your

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,610
computer that you use to access your

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,680
site your your operating system and

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,460
whatever software you use because those

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,040
are patching security issues as well and

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,590
anywhere along the line is a potential

00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,900
place for out-of-date software to be

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,810
compromised and ultimately result in a

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,290
compromised site so yes absolutely

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,670
update all the things it will help keep

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,740
you more secure as

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,930
general rule of thumb in pretty much

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,570
every software project ever

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:03,130
the most recent version is the most

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:06,220
secure version this is another one that

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:09,640
I hear a lot to varying degrees this is

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:15,040
maybe a bit extreme but the idea here is

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:18,460
that not all websites are target's right

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,820
if you don't do ecommerce if you don't

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:26,140
have personal information if your site

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:29,140
isn't especially popular then maybe it's

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:33,880
not a target and so you don't need to

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,650
worry about securing it because it's it

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,700
like no one's going to try to hack into

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,150
like my blog on pottery right is this

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,220
true

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,690
are there sites like this is your site

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,590
maybe small enough and simple enough

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:50,710
that it's not being targeted no it is

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,900
absolutely being targeted and and this

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,720
comes I think this assumption comes a

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,450
lot from movies and TV shows where we

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,600
get to see hackers that pick a target

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,050
and they sit at their computer and come

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,690
through a firewall tick tick tick right

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:11,530
that's not how most attacks against

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:14,470
websites happen it's great for TV and

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,600
movies but in the real world most of

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,990
what happens is though those bad actors

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,810
are writing scripts bots that crawl the

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,320
internet and look for vulnerabilities

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:29,440
and just try to break into every site

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,210
they they are programmed with known

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,150
vulnerabilities for out-of-date software

00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:36,640
especially which is why updating is so

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,350
important they're programmed with sets

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,110
of usernames and passwords that have

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:44,020
been gotten from these breaches with the

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,930
most common passwords that you can see

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:51,040
that actually hundreds of thousands of

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:53,140
people use and the only thing it takes

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,360
for your website to be a target of one

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,360
of these BOTS is for it to be on the

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,010
internet that's it if your website is on

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,290
the internet hint it is

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,670
it is absolutely a target and if it's

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,250
been on the internet for more than about

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,769
24 or 48 hours you've probably already

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:13,250
been through your first attack most of

00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:15,649
them are unsuccessful and that's okay

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,510
the good thing I don't want to scare

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:20,269
everyone by saying hey your site is

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,880
constantly under attack the good thing

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:25,670
is because we're mostly facing these

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,170
automated BOTS that have been programmed

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,360
and that there's some sort of delay

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,740
between them being created and and then

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,230
getting to your site that's if we can

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,829
defeat those BOTS if we can win against

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:43,940
these pieces of software then we can

00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:46,339
stop like 99.9% of potential attacks

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,459
like that's huge so this is actually

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:54,350
kind of of good news for us in the long

00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:56,750
run another one another assumption that

00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,769
I hear all the time is that locking down

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,779
the files of your site will improve the

00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:05,569
security of your site and what this

00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:08,180
means is like going in and changing the

00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:11,990
permissions on the files to make them

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,510
not writable the idea you would usually

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,269
have to do this through like FTP or your

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:20,029
hosting dashboard the idea being that if

00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:23,630
someone kind of breaks a little bit into

00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:26,569
your site and is trying to add some sort

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,980
of backdoor to a wordpress file they

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:30,319
wouldn't be able to because they can't

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:34,269
write to that file so they wouldn't be

00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:37,449
able to leave that nefarious code behind

00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:41,260
does locking down the file permissions

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:44,630
increase the security of your site a

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,850
little bit of mixed response there but a

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,220
decent number of noes actually and this

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,980
one is busted but there's a there's

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,540
actually a lot of reasoning behind this

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:58,370
I'd like to explain this one a little

00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:00,139
bit first of all I think that locking

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,300
down your files is a little bit like

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:04,850
putting the security in the wrong place

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,040
we like having layers of security but to

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,930
me this is a little bit like putting a

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,910
security door between your living room

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,810
and your kitchen saying hey if someone

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,340
breaks into my living room

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,040
they won't be able to get in the kitchen

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:20,880
and get the you know China or whatever

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,710
it is and I would rather just not let

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,720
them in the house at all that's where I

00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,910
want to draw the line I want to put my

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,710
last line of defense at not getting into

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:34,770
my sight period but locking down your

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,840
files can actually have a very adverse

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,860
effect as well I talked a little bit

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,810
about updating and we have this amazing

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,650
thing in WordPress called automatic

00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:50,220
updates meaning that when the security

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:52,140
team for WordPress fixes some sort of

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,020
vulnerability when we patch it and when

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,590
we push out a new security release your

00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,950
site will automatically update and close

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:04,590
that vulnerability we can push out a

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:07,740
release that patches a vulnerability and

00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:10,830
protect tens of millions of sites in a

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,770
single day without any one of you having

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,940
to interact with your site in any way we

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:20,310
just do it for you but if you lock down

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,750
your files so that WordPress can't write

00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:27,000
to them then we can't update your site

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:31,050
which means that you have to do that

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,750
yourself and honestly you are far more

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,580
at risk of something bad happening to

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,060
your site of your site being compromised

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,970
because you didn't update fast enough

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,620
then then it say automatic updates

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,450
breaking your site which is the thing

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,130
that I hear people worry about sometimes

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:57,390
our failure rate on automatic updates is

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:59,400
0.0 0.2 have a problem with that and

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,820
even some of those are able to rollback

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,550
and at least not break your site and so

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,010
you are way less likely to have a

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,780
problem with automatic updates than with

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,940
having your site compromised because you

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,590
didn't update fast enough and one of

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,810
those scripts was able to get to your

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,810
site before before you were

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:28,490
there we go ah what about changing your

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:30,590
username this one I hear a lot in

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,680
WordPress it always sounds like don't

00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:36,230
use the username admin that's a thing

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,940
that you should avoid but as you spread

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,790
out to the rest of the Internet and all

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,880
these other services it's more about

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:46,210
don't use an obvious username don't use

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:50,330
something that people can guess or no

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:53,060
because if you do and hackers can know

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,800
your username they're halfway to breakin

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,600
into your account because it's just your

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,550
username and password that protect you

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,380
they're halfway there if they know your

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,500
username you don't want them to have

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,780
that does avoiding using admin or some

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:11,210
common username keep your site more

00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:14,840
secure it does not it does not keep your

00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:17,330
site more secure the there is a little

00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,840
bit of historical context to this to why

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:24,050
this advice tends to be so prevalent in

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,840
the earlier days of WordPress every

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,940
WordPress install had an admin user

00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,610
automatically added with the username

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:35,600
admin and it just asked you for the

00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:39,170
password to put on that account and so

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,640
the very early thoughts and and scripts

00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,650
that crawled the internet to try to

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,900
break into WordPress sites tended to

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,430
have that hard-coded in that's just not

00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,190
the case anymore they're more

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,680
sophisticated they've gotten better and

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,200
so they can just discover what your

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,110
username is that's pretty normal but

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,420
that's not really scary my username on

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,450
every one of my WordPress sites is Aaron

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,000
Campbell no space my username on Twitter

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,280
is also Aaron Campbell and it's up on my

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,770
slide right every time I tweet you you

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,660
know that my email address is Aaron at

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,820
Aaron T Campbell comm and that's my

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,520
gmail user name for that account and

00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:19,700
none of those are private

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,280
I don't keep any of those secret but

00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,730
that's because those aren't actually

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:29,060
part of security your username is more

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,570
like public information it's it's making

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,120
a claim

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,040
that you are this person but then your

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,660
site is asking for proof and that proof

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,490
is the password it's not that much

00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,280
different from if I walk into my bank

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,230
and I say I'm Erin Campbell I want money

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,660
from my account and they say prove it

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,150
and I say oh here's my ID write the

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,140
password is the ID the password is the

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:54,450
proof and focusing too heavily on trying

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,820
to keep your username private I feel

00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,250
like distracts people from actually

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,560
concentrating on having really truly

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:05,970
good passwords which is where your

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,130
security really comes from what about

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,870
changing the database prefix who has

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,380
heard that this will keep your your

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:17,190
website more secure who has no idea what

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,900
this is if you look in your WordPress

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,240
database you probably see a list of

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,190
tables and if you have made no changes

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,250
they probably all start with WP

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,920
underscore WP underscore posts WP

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,830
underscore comments WP underscore users

00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,500
and you can change that it's a setting

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,420
in the WP config file you can set that

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,020
to essentially anything that you want

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,430
and the idea is that if someone's trying

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,010
to break into your site if they're

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,410
trying to send queries to your database

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,140
to try to get maybe a list of users or

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,540
anything else you don't want them to

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:56,190
know the table names that they need to

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:59,370
use to pull that data and so you can

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:02,580
change it to something less known and it

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,820
will protect your site does this protect

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:12,540
your site does this make your site more

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:15,420
secure no it does not this is this is

00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,090
one of those things where this doesn't

00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,220
hurt the security of your site changing

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,560
the the prefix in the database but again

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,480
scripts have just gotten a lot more

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,300
intelligent over the years they don't

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:31,140
need to have pre-programmed in table

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:33,210
names they can discover them but even

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,650
though this won't hurt the security of

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,330
your site if you want to change that

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,830
there that's fine like there's other

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,960
reasons to change it maybe you're

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,030
running multiple WordPress sites in the

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,200
same database or maybe you just like

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,800
naming things

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,140
that's fine too but I want to focus on

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,870
trying to bust these things that don't

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:57,000
actually improve security because I feel

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:59,790
like most of us do some set number of

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,860
things to try to secure our site and we

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,540
may not have purposely set that number

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,460
but subconsciously there's a number

00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,860
somewhere some of us will do two or

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,690
three things to try to keep our site

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,270
secure some of us may do six or eight or

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,610
eight or ten but at some point you

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,850
subconsciously feel like I have put in

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:20,970
the effort I have done the things I hope

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,440
that I'm secure now and you kind of stop

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:27,450
and so I don't want any of those things

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,010
to be something that you only think is

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,940
making you more secure but it's not

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:35,220
actually having any kind of effect and

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,690
so this is one of those things that if

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,810
you want to change it fine but don't

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:44,150
think that it's for securing your site

00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:48,510
this one is busted as a security measure

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:53,850
what about hiding the admin interface or

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:56,280
hiding the login page WordPress powers

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:59,640
over a third of the internet now so

00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,190
roughly one in every three sites that

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,850
some bad actor goes to on the Internet

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:08,970
is WordPress site and with basically all

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:11,310
of those if you to add slash WP dash

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,620
admin to the end it will redirect you to

00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:18,470
a login page or you could go straight

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:23,400
there by putting slash WP login dot PHP

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:26,310
and we don't necessarily want bad actors

00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,350
to be trying to login to our site so

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:31,200
maybe we don't want them to see that and

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:34,830
moving that to someplace that a third of

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:42,000
the internet isn't using would that make

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:45,330
our site more secure no it will not this

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,640
is this is kind of funny I like to try

00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,530
to put this in the context of like real

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,670
world security like securing your house

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:55,560
right you you you want your house to be

00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,360
to be secure to be a place that like

00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,220
thieves can't get into but this would be

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,390
like having a walkway up to your house

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:06,030
and like a porch and no front door but

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,710
like a thief knows that you get in and

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,570
out of your house somehow right like

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,920
they'll just walk around and look for

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,410
your door this is not especially

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,180
difficult and modern with modern-day

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,280
scripts that are trying to break into

00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,890
sites it's not that difficult for them

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,500
either they will find the login page but

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,150
just like a real-world thief trying to

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,000
break into a house might also try a

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,680
window or a back door scripts will do

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,960
that too they might try to log in

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,450
through the XML RPC interface which is a

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,270
another more programmatic way of logging

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,400
into WordPress or the the JSON API

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:43,350
another way of trying to log into

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:47,370
WordPress and so trying to hide this

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:49,890
from them is not very useful at all

00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:52,410
instead focus on making sure that when

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,510
they do try to when they do find it when

00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,640
they do try to break in they just don't

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,710
succeed and we'll talk a little bit more

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,520
about how to do that in these next

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:05,400
couple or a few things

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,560
what about SSL this one has gained a lot

00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,600
of popularity over the last couple years

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,520
in in the amount of time that it's

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,840
talked about on the internet because

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,450
well first of all prices drop

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,450
dramatically on SSL Certificates that's

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,100
obviously a good reason for for

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,740
recommending them to people but also

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,350
we've had some things like Google coming

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,000
in and saying that that this is a thing

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,830
that they consider for search engine

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,480
rankings and stuff like that but like

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,630
search engine rankings are not the same

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,300
as security so the question is does

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:44,630
having an SSL certificate on your

00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,630
website keep your website more secure

00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,300
it absolutely does this one is a hundred

00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:00,070
percent confirmed and I look forward to

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:02,440
the day when every single website has an

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:06,160
SSL certificate on it I really think

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,320
that that's where we need to be yes like

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,720
e-commerce stores and things like that

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,290
have needed them for a very long time

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,090
but now if I was doing that pottery blog

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:19,060
that I had talked about it should have

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:22,600
an SSL certificate too and the reason

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:24,460
that this is so useful is because when

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,230
you try to access your site whether

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,020
you're logging it logging in or if

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,120
you're just a regular visitor accessing

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,160
your site the traffic actually goes

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,370
through a lot of places before it

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,200
eventually gets to your site it it goes

00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,150
through your home router or maybe the

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,130
coffee house Wi-Fi if that's what you're

00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:44,020
connected to and then through a bunch of

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,420
other routers as it makes its way to its

00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,880
final destination and any of those

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,130
places that it goes like all of those

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,250
are potential targets for a bad actor

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:56,860
and hopefully those are secure but if

00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:58,510
someone gets into one of them what the

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,670
reason that they want to get into those

00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,980
is to look at the traffic that's going

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,050
through and if they look at your traffic

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,090
coming through and they see your website

00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,350
name and your username and password that

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,150
is gold

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,170
they love that that's exactly what

00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:16,990
they're looking for but with SSL that

00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,390
traffic is encrypted from the time it

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,550
leaves your computer to the time that it

00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,400
gets to to the end point to the web

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:26,020
server and so even if they are able to

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,230
break into one of these places that's

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:32,050
totally not under your control the data

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,910
that they're seeing essentially is not

00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,610
useful to them they would then have to

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,530
break some sort of encryption and the

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,810
the modern encryption for SSL

00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:44,890
certificates is quite good that would

00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:47,320
take an awful lot of effort and time and

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:52,170
is just highly unlikely so this keeps

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,170
you much more secure

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,020
this brings me to the last of the things

00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,880
that I specifically want to talk about

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,010
but I want to dig into it a little bit

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
what about passwords right our password

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,920
is important of course they are like we

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,820
don't even need to talk about that one

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,890
except that they're so important that I

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,550
think we need to dig in a little bit on

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,100
what actually makes a good password like

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:18,290
we all know everyone here knows that you

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,780
need to have a good password but what

00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:23,000
does that mean

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:25,700
what is a good password because you get

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,560
lots of different advice from lots of

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,180
different people so I want to look at

00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,740
some of the things that people say make

00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:36,140
good passwords and see if they really do

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:39,830
long right a lot of people talk about

00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,690
how your password needs to be longer it

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,490
used to be you know six or eight

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,170
characters and people are saying oh no

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:49,130
it needs to be more than ten more than

00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:56,180
twelve how do longer passwords make

00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:59,810
better passwords yes longer passwords

00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:03,050
make better passwords if everything else

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:06,890
is essentially the same like it there

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:09,790
there are some caveats to that yes but

00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:12,890
all other things being considered equal

00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:16,520
longer is better passwords are generally

00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,950
measured in what we call in entropy

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,260
which is essentially like the number of

00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,090
guesses that it would take to break your

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,670
password like that's what you can think

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,680
of it as and if everything else is

00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:30,770
basically the same then a longer

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,750
password means more guesses more guesses

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:35,000
is good like that's what we want we want

00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:39,440
them to have to work really hard to

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,960
figure out what our password is well

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,260
substitutions we see this one a lot

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:48,230
right someone someone's password is like

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,990
their dog's name but the one is an

00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:53,000
exclamation point or the I is an

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,980
exclamation point or a one or a pipe

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,180
sign or something like that where

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:04,720
they've replaced letters with symbols

00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:04,720
does this make your password better

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:13,000
this one's tough but I'm gonna say bust

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:15,130
it and here's why first of all there

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,710
really are only a handful of letters

00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,660
that look like some other symbol and for

00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,120
each of those there's only a handful of

00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,430
symbols that look like those and in most

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,220
of the modern password cracking tools

00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:30,100
that I have seen and audited and such

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:32,530
they take this into account when they're

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,690
trying a word they try the word and then

00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:37,270
they replace the letters with these

00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:40,480
symbols and they try the iterations and

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:43,450
it really doesn't add that many more

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,800
guests attempts to breaking a password

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:50,290
with substitutions but what it does do

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,550
is make your password much harder to

00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:56,620
remember right and because of that

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:59,170
people that use this method tend to have

00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,230
shorter passwords with those

00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:04,960
substitutions in them and losing the

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,240
length often times you lose more entropy

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,210
because you have lost some of the

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:14,320
characters than you gained by adding in

00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:16,240
these substitutions so in theory if you

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,240
could do this and keep nice long

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,370
passwords and not have it causing you to

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,400
make to make shorter passwords then

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:27,070
maybe but that just doesn't seem to hold

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,400
true with most people and so I cannot

00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:33,700
recommend this one

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,850
what about past phrases this is my dog

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:40,750
king err by the way she is a rescue and

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:43,210
she is very needy at times and I was on

00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,950
a video call when I took this picture of

00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,100
her and she sat there the entire time

00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:50,680
with her head right up next to the

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,360
armrest of my chair just staring at me

00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,780
like you should be paying attention to

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,430
me not that screen and the idea of

00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,710
passphrases is that we take something

00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,180
memorable like this a moment that we

00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,630
will remember a thing that we will

00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,970
remember and we turn it into a password

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:11,800
my dog's name is king air so it might be

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:14,440
king air watches me on calls this is 27

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,020
characters much better than just making

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:22,470
my password King air right

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:26,260
so it's it's nice and long do passwords

00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:38,500
made from past phrases like our is that

00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:44,080
is that a good password this one is

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:48,190
extremely plausible but I think but I

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:52,800
think not the actual winner of how to

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:54,910
have the best password longer is better

00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,670
100% right

00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,470
spaces are good don't take those out if

00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:04,660
you're if you're doing passwords this

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:06,940
way but there are even better ways let's

00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:10,090
look at the three things that it really

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,460
takes to have a great password great

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:16,690
passwords are long we touched on that

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,610
they're random randomly generated

00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,290
passwords are better and they're unique

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,080
meaning that they're never used in more

00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:24,250
than one place and the problem with

00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,550
passphrases

00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:30,010
is that again we we sort of see password

00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:33,250
cracking as happening much like it does

00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:35,170
in the movies where you see this this

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:38,320
thing on the screen going through a then

00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:40,240
B then C and eventually AAA BAC until it

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,120
eventually cracks the password that is

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,250
that is like raw brute force hacking and

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,550
it's like the least efficient way of

00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,350
cracking a password but it will always

00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,630
get you there eventually now it may be

00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,179
you know decades from now if it's a good

00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:57,820
password but in theory that should

00:31:55,179 --> 00:32:01,990
always get you there eventually

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,460
most modern BOTS and scripts that are

00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,730
running around attacking all of our

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:09,220
sites are never trying that type of

00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:13,390
password cracking now they may do that

00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:15,700
if they have already compromised some

00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,980
site and got a set of credentials down

00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,080
but those are encrypted and they're

00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,270
trying to undo encryption then it may

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,429
happen but in the vast majority of cases

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,990
they're never getting there but some of

00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:29,110
them do get to what are called

00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:31,870
dictionary attacks which is where they

00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:34,240
take words and put them together to try

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:36,370
to make passwords combining them with

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,830
common use cases like an exclamation

00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,510
point at the end or a number one or two

00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,510
at the end and they try to make

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,880
passwords that way because it takes

00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:48,190
fewer guesses and they might get it and

00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,380
this is only five words and if they were

00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,790
to come to break some of these scripts

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,770
that I've seen if they were to come try

00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,870
to break into my Arin D Campbell comm

00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:58,120
site they would see my link to Twitter

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,280
and it would immediately follow that and

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,950
pull down words and make a dictionary

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,510
for me and I have definitely tweeted

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,179
about my dog king air which is the only

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,440
unique word in this and so that would be

00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:11,080
in their dictionary if they were

00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,049
building a an attempt to break my

00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,540
password they would have that would they

00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:18,390
be able to get to this eventually most

00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,980
of the scripts probably wouldn't take

00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:24,669
enough attempts to actually get all the

00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:28,000
way to a phrase this long but it's not

00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:31,809
it's not as good as having an actual

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,140
random password that forces these

00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:37,510
scripts to use the least efficient

00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:40,059
password cracking method possible brute

00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:43,059
force and so instead of doing this we

00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:45,429
can go with long random and unique and

00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:47,470
the only way to do that the only of my

00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,480
passwords by the way when I say Long's I

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,870
realized I didn't qualify that my

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,020
passwords are all 50 plus characters but

00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:59,679
I recommend at least 20 plus like the 10

00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:02,230
or 12 that that we see recommended a lot

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,059
of times that's older information from

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,580
when computers weren't quite as powerful

00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:09,119
as they are now so I would recommend at

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,700
least 20 characters how can you have

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,350
passwords that are 20 characters long

00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,350
completely random and a different one

00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,730
for every site that you use like my

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,619
password for my website is not the same

00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,419
as for my email which is not the same as

00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:25,990
for my computer and they shouldn't be

00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:30,040
that is the only way to do it is with a

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:32,470
password manager everyone should be

00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,440
using a password manager who here uses a

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:37,240
password manager I love this as I as

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,889
I've given more and more of these talks

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,120
I have seen that number slowly

00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:43,580
increasing if you didn't raise your hand

00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,320
your homework for between now in the

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,080
next session like it's that important

00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,669
talk to somebody that did and find out

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,120
how you can get set up on a password

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:55,580
manager I use LastPass personally a lot

00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,740
of people use one password especially if

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,500
you're pretty heavy and like the Apple

00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,930
ecosystem but I don't care what password

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,810
manager you use just use one it's the

00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:09,890
only way to have good password practices

00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:12,980
online so that was all the assumptions

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:15,290
that I brought to the table today I'm

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,710
Aaron Campbell by the way I worked for

00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:22,130
GoDaddy I'm focused heavily on the the

00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:24,110
WordPress ecosystem most of my I guess a

00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,690
lot of the data that I bring to the

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:30,380
table around this talk is is from having

00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:32,690
led the WordPress security team for 2017

00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,960
and 2018 I'm not doing it anymore but

00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,340
I'm still a part of it but I want to

00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,350
take the time to hopefully either

00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,350
clarify things if anyone has questions

00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:44,480
or better yet if you've heard something

00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:48,430
let's see if we can confirm or bust it

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,430
right now yeah

00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:00,640
hmm so there was actually like three

00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,980
parts to this question I think which is

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,320
is limiting the login attempts a good

00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:10,130
thing is two-factor authentication a

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,000
good thing and is is CAPTCHA a good

00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,610
thing

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,610
I'll take them well I'll take the

00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:21,920
CAPTCHA one first I am NOT a fan of

00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:24,080
CAPTCHAs generally I guess that I would

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,970
say that it's maybe plausible if I'm

00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:31,100
going for the confirmed busted plausible

00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:34,580
thing it can potentially protect against

00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:37,420
these automated attacks if you were to

00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,100
somehow roll it out to also the other

00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,960
interfaces to your site not just your

00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,180
one login form it would also need to

00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,990
somehow cover and this is where it

00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:50,750
starts to get impossible your XML RPC

00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:56,690
interface and your REST API interface

00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:58,880
and so without those using it it quickly

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,550
becomes less functional but still a

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,720
burden on your users that are trying to

00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:13,550
validly login to your site for limiting

00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:18,410
login attempts that is great if if you

00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:24,650
can do it pretty reliably most people

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:27,350
with individual sites really can't if

00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:30,350
you can get some sort of limit login

00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:32,690
functionality that's supplied by a a

00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,940
bigger company that's kind of outside

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:38,030
your WordPress site and is seeing a much

00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,090
broader range of things then that might

00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,190
be helpful but what happens is most of

00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,740
these scripts they're not coming from a

00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,470
single location they're not necessarily

00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,510
trying only a single username as a

00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:54,050
matter of fact these scripts are hitting

00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:56,300
from lots of different IP addresses from

00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,610
various countries and they're trying

00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,140
different usernames so limiting the

00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,840
login attempts even if you just give

00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,150
them say three login attempts per IP

00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,759
address they'll just use thousands of IP

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:11,839
addresses to still get as many

00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:13,939
temps as they really want and so in

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,089
theory limiting the number of chances

00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:19,609
someone has to try sounds useful but

00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:22,699
it's actually really hard to do in any

00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:25,809
kind of useful way with the limited

00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:28,519
picture that a single website gets

00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:31,989
two-factor authentication was the other

00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:35,649
one and that is 100% confirmed

00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:39,019
two-factor authentication is absolutely

00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:44,209
amazing for increasing the security of

00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:46,429
your site it's a thing that kind of went

00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:48,139
to I felt like went just a little beyond

00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:49,399
what what I was talking about in this

00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:51,219
talk but since you brought it up I'm

00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:53,929
gonna talk about it anyway

00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:56,179
two-factor is a form of multi-factor

00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:58,369
authentication and essentially they're

00:38:56,179 --> 00:39:00,229
like three things that you can use to

00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:02,630
prove that you are who you claim to be

00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:05,419
there's there's something that you know

00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:09,289
like a password there's something that

00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:11,359
you have like your phone in your hand or

00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:13,009
one of those little keychain things that

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,109
a bank might give you that generate

00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:18,979
tokens and there's something that you

00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:22,759
are like your fingerprints or your you

00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:24,799
know facial recognition and two-factor

00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:28,009
means that in order to log into your

00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:30,829
site you have to you you are basically

00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:34,399
have to prove using two of those methods

00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:36,769
in most cases that is something that you

00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:39,079
know you give it your password and then

00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:40,579
something that you have it will ask you

00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:43,489
for a six digit code and there's

00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:46,369
probably an app on your phone that gives

00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:49,099
you that code and that code changes like

00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:53,269
every 30 seconds and that's fantastic

00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:54,979
because then if there was something in

00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:58,279
the Wi-Fi that was pulling down the

00:39:54,979 --> 00:40:00,019
things that you were typing or if

00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:01,909
someone was even looking over your

00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:04,159
shoulder and like read your password and

00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:07,489
your two-factor code that's good for

00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:10,369
about 30 seconds and then it's not any

00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:12,829
more so two-factor authentication is

00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:14,569
really fantastic and there are plugins

00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:16,849
that let you add this to WordPress

00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:19,719
really easily there's a free one in the

00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:21,050
WordPress plug-in repository called

00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:23,930
two-factor

00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:27,320
and it's one that that I helped I helped

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:32,690
author and it will work with oh it will

00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:35,720
work with almost any two-factor app on

00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:47,390
your phone which you can download pretty

00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:48,890
easily ya know so the question was does

00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,960
your mother's maiden name count is too

00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:54,320
factor but the funny thing is that like

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,050
that's clearly talking about security

00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,330
questions right the if you forget your

00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:01,460
password we're gonna ask you these other

00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:03,260
questions to verify that you are who you

00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,390
say you are and then we're going to go

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:09,250
ahead and reset your password and I

00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:12,170
despise those because they are either so

00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:14,990
impossible that you can't remember them

00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:17,330
asking you things like your favorite

00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:19,760
song and you're like well what was my

00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,430
favorite song whenever I answered this

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,940
question whenever that was and did I

00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:29,420
type it right or is it you know or

00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:31,400
they're so standard that anyone can find

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,220
them out about you like your mother's

00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,710
maiden name and none of that is any good

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:40,730
instead use a password manager so that

00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:42,980
you don't forget your passwords and then

00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,560
do like I do and answer those questions

00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,210
with things like you're not me and then

00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,910
a bunch of random characters like that

00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,920
is there is no way that I could ever get

00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,600
the answer right to any of my security

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:59,440
questions but I also will never need

00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,440
them yes go ahead

00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:10,730
there are so she did mention about

00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:12,980
secure notes in LastPass most password

00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,410
managers have this and that can be

00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,289
useful even for things like backup

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,559
two-factor authentication codes so that

00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:23,420
if something were to happen and your

00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,369
two-factor app was no longer working you

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,549
could use a backup code to get into it

00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:30,170
but yeah I don't store my answers in

00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:31,220
there I just make them completely

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,049
pointless

00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:42,170
yeah there was a couple hands over here

00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:48,190
yeah right here it is the plug-in is

00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:48,190
spelled out T wo - T wo factor yeah

00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:07,050
so the concern is that if you put all

00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,180
your passwords into a password manager

00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,770
it feels a lot like putting all of your

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,780
eggs into one basket

00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,640
doesn't that seem a little dangerous is

00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,490
there some sort of backup or contingency

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,800
plan for that it's one of the reasons

00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:21,540
that I like LastPass and I think that a

00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,260
lot of the password managers are

00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:27,000
starting to do some form of this now

00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,440
although I'm a little less familiar with

00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,120
them because I kind of just settled in

00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,500
on LastPass and have been using it for a

00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:37,530
while but LastPass pulls your encrypted

00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,630
database of passwords to the various

00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:43,070
devices that it's being used on and the

00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:45,270
encryption levels are very high and also

00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,070
completely configurable you can actually

00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,960
go into settings and change the way it

00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,760
encrypts and all kinds of things so it's

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,400
not easy to break into that but that

00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,720
database exists on my laptop because

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,670
I've used it from my laptop and it

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,470
exists on my phone because I've used it

00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:01,890
from my phone and it exists on the

00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,240
LastPass service so if everything went

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,300
terribly wrong

00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,340
with that service I still have all of my

00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:12,120
passwords on my two devices that's

00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:14,520
accessible right now and for me that is

00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,830
good enough I mean everybody has to make

00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,920
their own decisions on on how much

00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:22,350
contingency planning you want to do that

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,900
is that is acceptable for my level of

00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:26,900
that I how much more time do I have

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,640
okay I do still have some time yeah

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,830
[Music]

00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,500
so the question is a little bit well it

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,970
was more of a comment but actually I

00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,900
have something to say about it anyway so

00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,650
I'm going to treat it like a question

00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,140
was that was around contingency planning

00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,839
if you lock it all of your access in

00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,880
something like LastPass and you were to

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,160
pass away if something were to happen to

00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,750
you

00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,579
how does someone else get access to that

00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,700
and something that LastPass has built

00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:17,099
into it is actually the ability to

00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:19,710
designate a person that will be able to

00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,599
just click request and get access to

00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,790
that you've given them the allowance and

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,770
the way it works is you can either set

00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,809
it up to give them immediate access to

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,700
give it with a one-week delay or a

00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:32,069
one-month delay or a three-month delay I

00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:35,339
think are the options and essentially if

00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:38,099
they request it and you don't deny it

00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:41,549
within that timeframe they essentially

00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:43,819
get your LastPass vault of passwords and

00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:46,559
get access to it my wife has that for me

00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:48,329
and so if something were to happen to me

00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,589
she would just click I need these

00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:53,390
passwords and she would get them

00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:53,390
immediately yes

00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:06,420
yes so the question is around WordPress

00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:08,369
plugins for increasing security things

00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,829
like firewalls are there things that we

00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:14,309
can do outside of just our own kind of

00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:17,490
best practices to help increase security

00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:19,589
on our sites and yes absolutely a lot of

00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:23,249
those are extremely useful the wordfence

00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:24,740
plug-in is particularly good and and

00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:26,880
they're here and you can ask them

00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,279
specific details about that and that's

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,559
probably the best people to ask that

00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:34,769
question too but beyond that things like

00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:38,220
a Web Application Firewall or a laughs

00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:41,789
those are extremely useful there they're

00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:45,749
a little bit more advanced tools in some

00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:48,299
ways and they are the the best ones I

00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:50,670
feel like are generally paid options as

00:46:48,299 --> 00:46:52,470
well a cloud flare has a free option

00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,619
that's pretty good but their paid option

00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:58,259
is dramatically better sakura has one

00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:00,450
and these are things that filter

00:46:58,259 --> 00:47:02,880
essentially the traffic requests that go

00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:06,089
to your site go through them first and

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,519
then to your site and they can watch for

00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:10,019
potentially malicious traffic and filter

00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:11,970
it out before it ever even gets to your

00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:14,249
site right like someone can't break into

00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:16,859
your site if they can't like if they are

00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:20,089
caught before they ever get there and so

00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:20,089
that is extremely useful

00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:34,890
what about passwords for your computer

00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:36,750
so good password practices need to

00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:39,810
happen absolutely everywhere not just

00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,130
your WordPress site the specific

00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,320
question about getting into your

00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:45,030
computer can be a little bit of a

00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,280
different answer I guess because like

00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:50,940
LastPass can't autofill that for me I'm

00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,250
not in there yet and so this comes down

00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,170
to when I don't use LastPass which is

00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,359
really only for the password to get into

00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,369
my computer and the password to get into

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:02,280
LastPass which also I have multi-factor

00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:07,339
authentication on but for those things

00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:11,040
how do I come up with passwords I use

00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:16,260
kind of a modified form of passphrases

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:20,070
I will use something that is not a real

00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:23,220
word that contains unique symbols it

00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:26,280
could be a mathematical formula it could

00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,650
be like for me I love maths so like that

00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,319
is often a go-to for me but it can be

00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:35,040
anything something that contains symbols

00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:37,230
and is not a word and then also a phrase

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,390
and so I will put in this like

00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,160
mathematical formula and then a phrase

00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:44,010
like King Air watches it watches me on

00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,950
calls and I combine those to make the

00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:52,500
two passwords that I need to actually

00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:54,720
know maybe one last question

00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,420
I will also be around I'm going to be

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,940
heading straight over to the happiness

00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,410
bar so if other people have questions

00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,849
you can certainly find me there but I

00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:09,079
think I have time for maybe one more no

00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:09,079
awesome thank you

00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,020
