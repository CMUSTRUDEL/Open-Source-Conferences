00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:06,150
so welcome this this we have a lot to

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,400
cover here so I'll do my best to get

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,320
through it quickly but certainly slow me

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,790
down if I go too fast well have

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,830
questions at the end if we have time but

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,900
happy to take some during if we get to

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,550
them much of this has been pulled at a

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,289
podcast called digital cast that I put

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,760
out a couple of times a week it's a

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,350
really short podcast about what Google

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,300
has going on so this is basically a

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,189
summary of you know what I've covered in

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,090
there for the last year so I don't think

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,039
many of you have listened to it so

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,199
hopefully you haven't let's spoil some

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,520
of that so really it's not about

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,800
everything else episodes but things

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,149
about Guttenberg and SEO and Google and

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,210
all that gonna stop focusing on Google

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,910
and SEO kind of stuff how many you saw

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,620
Bobbie and Jenny's talks hands yeah

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,210
mostly good cuz well I'll reference a

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,070
few things they did there they covered

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,730
some specific topics a speaking of Jenny

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,110
there she is look at yay today we're

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,120
gonna cover kind of a wide variety of

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,680
things and my big thing with WordCamp

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,449
in general and it's proven out again

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,070
this year and particularly this talk is

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,780
just those nuggets of information you

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,489
can get you know a lot of us been coming

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,600
for years and we know most everything we

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,339
hear but there's that one thing that's

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,360
just awesome actually was just telling

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,740
me just a few minutes ago just a few

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,880
more little things like it was a good

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,380
talk I knew all that pay he said this

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,479
one thing that we need to totally do and

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,740
so I'm hopeful that something in here

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,210
will will give you a nugget so I have

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,560
like 75 different little things Google

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,299
is done and most people say yeah okay

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,400
that makes sense but ooh that one's

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,470
great I need to change that see what's

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,320
going on a few other quick thoughts

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,610
before we start google says people say

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,229
google is always changing and I don't

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,850
really think that's true they talk about

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,350
the Panda updates within content and

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,000
Penguin updates those have been updates

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,610
that Google's made over the years to the

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,250
algorithm but not many big changes most

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,630
of what they have is you want enforcing

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,610
their authority they're saying hey these

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,890
rules are the same since 1998 we haven't

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,630
changed anything big other than SSL is

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,280
now important speeds more important

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,390
Mobile's more important but everything

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,820
else has been the same right good

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,290
content don't cheat don't buy backlinks

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,670
it's not new stuff they're better at

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,310
enforcing it and a lot of their updates

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,619
are just about enforcing that so with

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,369
that said we're gonna dive in here and

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,659
get onto that really there's kind of

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,040
three categories of things that I'll

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,719
have in here some to the extent possible

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,979
these are things Google has said they

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,110
say a lot on Twitter they have a couple

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,520
guys on Twitter that say from Google's

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,890
mouth this is what we've done I'll share

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,960
some of those they've somewhere the

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,160
community the rand fishkin and big SEO

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,720
people or to say hey we've noticed this

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,220
with google we've tested it this is true

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,840
and then you have some in between where

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,280
google says this is what's happening you

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,569
have people like ran to say no we don't

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,770
agree our test is showing different so

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,600
I'll share some of those too and we can

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,400
all kind of see what happens and these

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,280
are essentially in random order and

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,930
again please stop me as we go so the

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,300
first one doesn't care about your fresh

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,620
content it's not that fresh content is

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,030
bad it's certainly a good thing but

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,350
Google doesn't give any kind of bonus

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,760
for fresh content they've made that

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,350
clear over the years if you produce a

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,000
ton of fresh content Google doesn't say

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,070
oh they produce a lot of content they're

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,270
ranking better unless you're like a news

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,610
site they don't care about that

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,140
specifically now again in general more

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,090
content is better more quality content

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,860
is better so fresh content by that

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,940
regard is better but being fresh there's

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:03,420
no fresh bonus in Google the next one

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,709
oops there we go Google judges all of

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,480
your content and this is one that seems

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,739
kind of obvious but this come if you

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,269
have a forum on your site or you take

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,410
comments on your blog Google looks at

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,120
all that so it's kind of an obvious

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,350
thing but something to keep in mind you

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,120
know if you allow blog comments keep

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,080
them moderated Google's going to look at

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,489
all that it's going to affect your

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,750
ranking for the pages where that content

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:23,430
appears mobile users search near me a

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,620
ton and think we all kind of seen this

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,049
coming last few years but according to

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,850
research 82% of smartphone owners have

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,769
performed some kind of search with local

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,540
intent behind it in the past year

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,130
doesn't mean they've said near me Jenni

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,420
talked about this some in her talk if

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,980
you do certain kinds of talk Google

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,900
knows you have local intent if I search

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,160
for used cars I don't have to say used

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,570
cars in Atlanta Google is gonna give you

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,910
the map and know that it's near me so

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,769
certainly that is a big thing that

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,950
Google has said it's true and again

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,600
we've all kind of known that singular

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,640
and plural keywords don't always rank

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,079
the same and we look at a keyword like

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,120
teddy bear it's a teddy bear and teddy

00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,920
bears is the same thing but does Google

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,239
see your intent the same so much of what

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,200
Google has is what they think you're

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,790
trying to do they're really trying to

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,019
think beyond that so in the case of

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,209
teddy bears if someone searches for

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,620
teddy bear and maybe more informational

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,459
trying to learn about the history or you

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,650
know what they're made of

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,180
search for teddy bears is probably more

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,340
shopping intents and Google will look at

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,510
it that way and so just that one little

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,590
ass can make a big difference and where

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,750
you're gonna show up because Google

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,280
think ah people want shopping content

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,539
for his page because of just a few

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,370
little things can make a big difference

00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:27,540
only 3% of your homepage traffic makes

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,890
it to your blog and so this

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,540
sounds like it's bad for blogging it's

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,340
really not but it's important because

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,140
they're saying people that arrive on the

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,880
home page of your site not many will go

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,200
then look at your blog and if you look

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,330
at the analytic stats that pretty much

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,620
holds true but blogs are still vitally

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,060
important because they're gonna be an

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,890
entrance point a lot of people arrive on

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,420
your site on your blog on specific blog

00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,010
posts you know one of the best

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,570
advantages of blogging is having all

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,920
these other doorways to your site with

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,870
different keywords and stuff so blogging

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,310
is great but just keep in mind that in

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,420
general people if they come to your site

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,040
a different way they're probably not

00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,000
gonna go check out your blog and that's

00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,290
okay they're gonna look about you

00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,280
they're gonna contact look at your work

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,930
to look at other things but

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,920
statistically that was kind of

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,590
interesting I would have guessed it was

00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,310
low but not that low but that's what the

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,080
numbers have shown so Google treats PDFs

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,870
essentially as HTML and this surprised

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,850
me as well PDFs generally don't rank as

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,010
well as their counterpart pages and that

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,360
I think is still true but Google says

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,860
they essentially take if they see a PDF

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,540
they kind of take it apart treat it as

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,880
HTML do what they can to rank it based

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,290
on that the issue with PDFs of course is

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,520
that you can't add title tags you can't

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,380
add meta descriptions you can't put alt

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,690
text on images they're not gonna rank as

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,400
well you're always best to keep PDFs I

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,540
would say PDFs are for printing if

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,710
something you want someone to print a

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,910
PVS a great way you know it'll be

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,380
formatted right if they're not going to

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,330
print it then it probably shouldn't be a

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,370
PDF you're better off putting it as text

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,450
on the page or in a blog post or some

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,280
other format there don't link to every

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,930
page from your homepage so this is one

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,820
that gets very tricky we spend a lot of

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,140
time with this on our site we're

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,520
building sites but links from the home

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,440
page of your site are very valuable if

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,670
you look at the way link activity flows

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,050
your home page is usually the most

00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,430
valuable page and so the links on your

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,590
home page of the most valuable links to

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,790
help rank your internal pages but if you

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,990
link to every page of your home page

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,310
you've kind of diluted it down to

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,470
nothing where none of those links are

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,850
really worth much anymore so a lot of

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,040
what we'll talk about today and stuff is

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,150
you know helping Google understand how

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,470
your site set up the more Google

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,150
understand your site what it's about

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,140
what the contents about the better and

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,940
you just link to everything from the

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,730
home page you don't really have best

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,780
pages big pages important pages so do

00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,800
take take care as you're doing that

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,630
google says you need alt text enter your

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,650
images this is not not anything new but

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,300
they've said it a few times this year

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,980
John Mueller and a couple other folks

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,900
have said a couple times you need alt

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,820
text on your images using WordPress

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,930
that's pretty easy to do but just take a

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,460
few minutes to do that we'll talk about

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,810
image names and a MINIX that's a little

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,400
bit different and a little trickier but

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,810
alt text you can just click on it

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,540
in the media library add your alt text

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,100
there describe your image best practices

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,199
make sure to describe the image and not

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,880
stiff stuff it with keywords but that's

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,320
there's other talks more about that but

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,430
do at least pay attention that because

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,389
Google's been stressing that more and

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,919
more the last year or two go ahead put

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,419
reviews from Google Maps on your website

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,680
so people have had concerns by this

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,090
saying hey if I get a review on Google

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,130
Maps and I copy and paste that review on

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,780
my site that's duplicate content and yes

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,400
it is but Google can recognize it and

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,600
they say clearly you know John Mueller

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,820
and some of them from Google said go

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,470
ahead put them on your site with one

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,580
caveat though there are ways I don't

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,440
know if anyone talked about structured

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,970
markup in this regard this weekend you

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,860
can do structured markup on reviews to

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,300
tell Google this is a review they say

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,620
not to do that on Google reviews because

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,060
then you're kind of competing it's

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,680
structured on Google Maps but if you

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,789
want to pull that text it says hey this

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,130
is a great experience I had a wonderful

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:30,479
time five stars from John cool put it on

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,889
your site don't worry about the

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,240
duplicate content it's still a good

00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:38,370
thing Google's alright with that white

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,289
space is not an SEO issue and this one

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,419
seems obvious but it kind of comes from

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:44,070
somewhere else back in 2012 there was

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,810
what they call the top heavy penalty

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,789
where sites had a lot of ads at the top

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,500
kind of above the fold and push the

00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,360
content down you would not rank as well

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,680
Google would penalize you for that a bit

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,150
though Google said if you have a lot of

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,340
white space at the top a big slide or a

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,110
big images that's okay they'll

00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,760
understand that the top heavy penalty

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,050
was more about ads so if you have a lot

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,550
of white space don't worry about oh it's

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,830
below the fold Google's gonna count less

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,060
they say that's okay white space is a

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,620
good thing they recognize it's a good

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,630
thing I hope most of you do as well and

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:14,370
Google's okay with that Google Google

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,630
cannot index pages that require cookies

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,490
and this one's coming up more and more

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,159
it seems logical of course they can't

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,900
but there's a dragon hiding in here if

00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,030
you for some reason to require cookies

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,620
for people to access your site that's

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,729
big trouble if you have a little cookie

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,260
thing at the bottom that they hit okay

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:29,520
they don't have to hit okay they can

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,139
still see the site but if it comes up

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,849
says hey you have to accept cookies to

00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,469
view the site google does not accept

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,709
cookies Google therefore won't see your

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,729
site and you're in big big trouble so

00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,930
cookie policies and stuff for getting

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,190
bigger and most sites handle it well

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,770
just be careful of that though make sure

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,940
if cookies aren't able to be caught they

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,680
can still see your site because you can

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,240
you'll just plumb it if you do that

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,110
pretty quick because Google will not see

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,610
anything aimed for pages that download

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,230
less than 100 milliseconds which is

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,610
super fast I don't

00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,940
that most of us have that we don't

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,230
usually hit that we go as fast as we can

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,220
but Google's that's the guy that he said

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,330
you should be aiming for a hundred

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,130
milliseconds I guess that's kind of a

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,540
good goal you know if you're a marathon

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,890
runner you should aim for two hours and

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,150
you're gonna end it three and a half or

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,560
four that's okay you still aim for

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,150
something good

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,080
google says really look for a bit slower

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,570
than that we'll talk more about

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,580
PageSpeed PageSpeed matters but not as

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,660
much as people think this really where

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,060
it matters more if you get that's path

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,040
fast as Google's crawl depth so Google

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,390
crawls your site for as many pages they

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,740
can get the faster they can download

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,240
them the more pages they'll get from

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,040
your site the more pages from your site

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,420
the better chance you'll have to rank

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,730
well so this will affect crawling but

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,840
not rankings as much unless things get

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,520
really slow Google search results aren't

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,690
personalized as much as you think and

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,400
this surprised me as well this is

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,750
something I always believed like you

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,680
know I can't do the same search and see

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,360
where I rank because it's so different

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,700
for everyone else and it is personalized

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,750
but not nearly the extent you think

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,420
there's some research that shows it's

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,280
it's really pretty much the same the

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,260
only personalized results Google really

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,550
shows apply the location of course I

00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,230
mean that's big my search for used cars

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,720
here versus in Seattle that's vastly

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,790
different or immediate context from a

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,650
prior search so if I search for used

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,670
cars and then I search for Ford it may

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,960
say well okay maybe he's looking for

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,180
used for words you know it'll kind of do

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,040
from a recent search but just in general

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,510
if we all search for the same thing it's

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,980
gonna be pretty similar more than I

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,510
think we've been led to believe and you

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,740
can do some tests and see that but I

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,840
thought that was interesting is I've

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,010
always sort of been thinking it's wildly

00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,600
different these days for us and it's

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,370
it's not as much as we would think so

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,230
your results should be a bit more

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,980
indicative of what others will see at

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,390
least more than we thought it was

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,040
let's see Google indexes and ranks

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,110
everything inside of accordions and tab

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,670
so this is one that Google said yes if

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,320
you have a tab sitting on your site with

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,120
like five different things the first one

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,500
is open and there's stuff hiding behind

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,660
the others they say they index it and

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,580
rank it just fine this is one where SEO

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,440
people kind of disagree and I sort of in

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,970
the disagree camp as well because it

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,650
seems foolish to me if someone searches

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,330
for something in the text they search

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,950
for it's buried in a tab that's not very

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,960
good user experience but Google has said

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,070
clearly that that doesn't matter if it's

00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,660
they're looking at the text on the page

00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,090
as a whole and if it's in an accordion

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,160
or tab it counts just as much so play

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,660
that as you will but certainly don't be

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,950
scared of accordions and tabs to break

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,410
up content on your site if that makes

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,550
sense for your user but I would take

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,080
that with a bit of a grain of salt you

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,990
see the

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,250
again the SEO folks that Jenny you have

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,250
thoughts there you ever looked at that

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:25,760
right yeah that's kind of where Google

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,050
is Google can see it the source code so

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,700
they see it and rank it I'm concerned

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,290
that humans can't see it right away but

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,790
but Google says it's okay and again this

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,930
is kind of sharing what Google has said

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:38,000
so we'll go with that Google is looking

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,380
for ways to handle gdpr blocking so a

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,510
lot of you dealt with this last year the

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,640
general data protection regulations in

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,290
Europe and how that affects some of our

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,820
sites here the interesting thing that

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,440
Google's facing I didn't realize is

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,690
almost all Google's crawlers are in the

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,829
US so they visit the other sites you

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,329
know they're okay

00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,620
but then when a European user goes to

00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:56,060
that site they may be blocked you know a

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,079
lot of US newspapers just blocked

00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,610
everyone from Europe just to keep

00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,019
themselves safe so someone in Europe

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,610
will do a site google site oh yeah this

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,380
New York Times articles perfect go to it

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,240
and they go to sit in their block so

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,160
Google is working on ways to fix that

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,390
but certainly be careful of the just

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,910
block everyone from Europe because can

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,290
have unintended consequences but I think

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,459
Google's plans to have more crawlers

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,990
coming from different countries so they

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,850
get a better sense of what's going on

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,110
but that's something they're working on

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,480
and they're struggling with and I think

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,600
a lot of us are struggling with as well

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,980
how to handle that kind of stuff Google

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,630
is using more neural matching to

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,940
understand synonyms so this is

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,649
interesting to where what you search for

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,990
the keywords may not even be on the page

00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,910
that it lands on but it still answers

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,589
the question so the example I saw is

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,240
somewhat search for why does my TV look

00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,010
strange and people looking for the soap

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,270
opera affect the motion smoothing you

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,470
see in those so if you search for

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,790
something and why does my TV look

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,740
strange I think you can search that now

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,970
the first result is the soap opera

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,500
effect and how that matters Google is

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,910
getting really smart about again

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,740
understanding intent not just trying to

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,329
match up why does my TV look strange but

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,470
what if someone really asking for and

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,110
what does a good page that answers it

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,220
even if they don't match up exactly and

00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,690
so there I don't understand their

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,579
algorithms fully and how that works but

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,260
again helping Google understand what

00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,970
you're about it's not as much about

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,230
direct keywords it is just Google knows

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,579
what's your about what's your contents

00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:11,510
about and they can match the appropriate

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:13,370
visitors to you low traffic doesn't

00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,750
always mean low-quality Google doesn't

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,519
look at page views that's not a factor

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,630
they don't say this site gets a lot more

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,910
traffic than this one that's not a

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,440
ranking factor at all and really a niche

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,710
topic that could be a great answer for a

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,540
question may get very low try

00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,130
because it's a niche topic Google is

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,270
fine with that you know low page views

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,130
doesn't matter so Google's not looking

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,510
at traffic and low traffic doesn't mean

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,600
it's a bad quality site and you could

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,040
have things about sub-niche of knitting

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,050
that's a very small group it could be a

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,910
great resource for that so low quality

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,300
doesn't mean a low traffic doesn't

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,950
necessarily mean low quality making

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,450
links to your site violates Google's

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,800
guidelines so this is a quote from John

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,120
Mueller here who works for Google and

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,890
tweets a lot if you've ever follow him

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,580
on Twitter he's a voice of Google which

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,740
is awesome

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,630
he says so the word make is kind of the

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,800
key here if you're making quality links

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,850
to your site then that would be

00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,950
considered against our webmaster

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,780
guidelines and by that those links would

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,550
definitely not be considered quality so

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,570
the idea with links of course is to get

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,920
people to link to your site because you

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,870
write great stuff they want to share it

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,700
with you and if you go to our blog a lot

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,380
of every post produce we link to other

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,610
great resources we found those are good

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,980
links but you found a way to go make

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,390
links you know by adding directories and

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,860
whatever that's just not gonna be as

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,810
good and Google says that's not what

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,490
we're trying to do and again this is not

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,510
new this is something they've kind of

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,010
said from day one but they're just

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,670
getting better and enforcing that kind

00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,860
of thing as time goes on word count and

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,240
other metrics can't measure quality so

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,860
another quote from John Mueller here he

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,480
said quote total word count does not

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,120
indicate suitability to answer a

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,140
question and often shorter is better so

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,370
this is kind of what jenny was talking

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,840
about today where people ask a question

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,670
Google's gonna say what is the answer to

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,020
that question it could be a thousand

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,370
word post explaining the ins and outs of

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,710
it but it could be here's the answer

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,480
that question so Google's not super

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,490
worried about word count again longer

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,690
can be better but it's not measuring the

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,800
quality if Google says hey people are

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,910
getting the answer they want here and

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,860
it's a short post but it gives the

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,880
answer great that's good quality that's

00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,440
what they're looking for that's what

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,790
really thought the users are looking for

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,740
and Google wants the best things for

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,090
their users so word count doesn't

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,950
necessarily matter that much sir great

00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,050
search ranking changes are unrelated to

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,370
Google's new mobile-first indexing so

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,990
you've probably heard about Google doing

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,000
a mobile-first indexing over the past

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,410
few years where really what it means is

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
they look at your full site versus look

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,650
at your mobile site and lately looking

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,480
more and more to your mobile site for

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,040
indexing not for ranking and that's kind

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,570
of the key there as Google's gonna look

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,520
at your mobile site to get the content

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,750
off of it and then rankings still factor

00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,700
a whole bunch of different things so

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,080
people here the mobile first indexing is

00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,790
having to be ranked based on my mobile

00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,500
site that's not quite true they're gonna

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,960
get the content from there but then

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,030
still figure out with variety of

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,440
things what's going on so unless your

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,880
mobile versions really screwed up it's

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,530
missing content for main site or

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,150
something like that it's really just an

00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,380
indexing thing it doesn't affect most of

00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,060
us you have a wordpress mobile

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,200
responsive site this is really a

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,690
non-event even though it's been talked

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,260
about a ton now thanks to WordPress

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,300
largely does Google use real-life user

00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,250
signals to assist with rankings and

00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,480
Google said basically no because they

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,530
have more things than they can see how

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,670
many people you probably see it in

00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,140
Google Maps like oh you go to the

00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,120
restaurant it's a busy restaurant it'll

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,440
show a little charts of busyness but it

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,020
doesn't necessarily mean it's a good

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,550
search result Google's main example it's

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,440
a great one is you're buying something

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,540
online how many people go to Amazon

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,220
store to buy something like no one's

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,080
going to the store the real-life user

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,020
signals don't do it the online user

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,400
signals mean a lot more so further I

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,840
think John Mueller said you know does a

00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,280
company having lots of visitors mean

00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,660
it's a good place maybe they have free

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,370
coffee that day so a whole bunch people

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,230
came doesn't mean it's a good place it

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,850
means they had free coffee so Google

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,130
chose use real life

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,780
user stuff where people are doesn't use

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,460
that to impact rankings too much yet I

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,530
suspect it will more but they make some

00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,310
good points on why maybe it doesn't make

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:46,190
sense why you should learn JavaScript to

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,480
help with SEO this is one WordPress at

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,890
large has talked about a lot for the few

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,190
years we're trying to work on javascript

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:54,020
more and really Google has said HTML and

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,580
technical SEO are still top priority the

00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,170
basic stuff that most of us know but

00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,180
javascript is getting more and more

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,070
prevalent if you can understand where it

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,150
works with SEO where it hinders SEO that

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,100
kind of stuff you're gonna be better off

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,839
for it in the long run so nothing

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,370
specifically Google said but just that

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,290
JavaScript being used more and more it's

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,550
gonna make your pages more complex and

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,050
you need to just pay attention to how

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,940
that might affect things going forward

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,220
what might be hidden and we'll talk

00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:20,000
about a few more specific examples as we

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,800
get a little further in Google says not

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
to use hash tags in your URLs and this

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,580
was a little tricky too because you'll

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,410
sometimes have pages where it's one long

00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,510
page if you click about it goes to my

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,910
psychic on hashtag about and jumps down

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,560
the page that's okay Google says that's

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,000
not a problem but there are some pages

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,590
where you click on something it'll add a

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
hashtag and then sort of create new

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,860
content it'll be like a database call

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,330
and do some weird things you see it with

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,340
some map applications and we move the

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,080
map around and put the hash tag with new

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,160
coordinates at the top Google says not

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,450
to do that because they're gonna assume

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,250
it's still the same page and could

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,760
confuse them WordPress out-of-the-box

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,530
doesn't

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
this but if you have if you're clicking

00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,200
around your site and there's sometimes

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,240
little hashtag shows up in the URL pay

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,950
attention to why it's there and it could

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,270
be causing problems but for most of you

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,680
I don't suspect it would simply having

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,330
more content doesn't impress Google

00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,980
similar to the fresh content more

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,570
content typically is a good thing but

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,130
Google's not gonna say oh he has 10,000

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,230
pages that's awesome let's rank him high

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,520
it doesn't they don't really care about

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,320
that at all more about the quality of

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,120
the content now if you have 10,000

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,010
quality pages you're gonna probably rank

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,230
pretty well but if you have 10 quality

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,760
pages versus a million bad pages this

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,620
site is probably gonna do better because

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,600
Google is not impressed by big numbers

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,130
you know again getting more great

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,750
quality pages is a good thing if you can

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,610
have hundreds and thousands of pages of

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,320
good quality content they can all rank

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,880
for their own thing and that's great but

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,200
Google is not gonna say because you have

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,670
a lot of content it's good kinda like

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,650
the fresh because it's fresh doesn't

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,230
mean it's good usually they go together

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,850
but in and of itself Google specifically

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,480
said we don't care about how much you

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,550
have Google finds new content through

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,320
links and then through sitemaps so most

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,420
of you if you sat through nate SEO

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,470
sessions heard about Google site Maps

00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,750
and it's important to do and it is

00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,010
important to submit those give Yoast and

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,020
Google search console you know there's

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,970
ways to submit those to Google certainly

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,620
a good thing but Google always looks for

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,030
links first to help them find new pages

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,560
because the links impact the rankings

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,390
you know if that's site links to another

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,920
that helps that page link better they're

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,270
always crawling the links first to see

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,350
what's going on and then they look at

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,970
your site map make sure they have all

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,320
the pages and that's good but if they

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,550
find a page there that has no links

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,590
pointing to it it's not gonna make a big

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,060
difference so sitemaps are good for

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,570
clarity but don't directly affect the

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,880
rankings

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,200
to the extent that links will so always

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,460
good to have that but good to know

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,570
that's what google is gonna find it the

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,440
sitemaps are really secondary to that

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,450
google may have some more details about

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,500
how 301 redirects work so if you're not

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,150
familiar with that that's basically just

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,160
a redirect they call it a 301 redirect

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,840
meaning it's permanent but hey if you

00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,400
get rid of the page so you have an about

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,810
page and history page and you decide to

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,690
combine them maybe have your history

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:46,310
pages redirect to the about one Google's

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,140
changed that a bit they clarified a few

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,760
things so it used to be if you had a

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,890
redirect from one page to another about

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,180
80% of the value it to a Google kind of

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,910
dilute things a bit it wouldn't rank as

00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,020
well and in 2016 they said no 100% if

00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,550
you redirect for one to another we're

00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,500
gonna pass all the signals all the links

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,360
it's all good

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,470
could be kind of good for spammers then

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,740
to do more tricky things they said we're

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,510
going to

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,160
watch that but for an average user we

00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,320
want to pass 100% of the signals on

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,330
you're doing your site the right way no

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,090
need to artificially decay some of that

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,230
that traffic and really what Google does

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,820
now is they create what's called a

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,530
canonical where if you have multiple

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,390
pages you can say these pages are the

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,920
same maybe things sort differently or

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,820
something this is the real one Google

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,350
don't worry about this other one they're

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,820
really the same page they said that's

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,410
how they treat redirects if you redirect

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,030
one to another Google says ok we know

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,530
about both pages but we're gonna set a

00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,730
canonical this is the main one we need

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,370
to worry about this is the main one we

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,320
need so nothing new nothing you need to

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,490
change there per se but it's just a good

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,780
thing if you need to do a redirect from

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,340
one page to another Google says that's

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,500
cool that's great we're gonna pass all

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,360
the juice across you know everything

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,530
should work well and again WordPress has

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,210
some great tools to do that for you

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,380
there's a plugin called redirection that

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,150
does a great job it's probably the most

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,960
popular one if you ever need to fix that

00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,880
Google wants you to fill in your own

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,230
meta descriptions so there are tools

00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,550
that can help automatically generate

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,050
meta descriptions and we probably all

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,190
recognize when we see meta descriptions

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,570
written by those tools because they're

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,100
awful

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,330
if you don't supply one at all Google

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,710
will go ahead and write one for you and

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,050
we've all seen those as well they're not

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,150
very good John Mueller said quote I

00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:13,400
generally recommend specifying one you

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,510
know your content best so it's one of

00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,700
those easy things to do in your pages

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,140
take just 30 seconds write a little meta

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,460
description doesn't affect your rankings

00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,500
directly but does affect how well you

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,059
show up in search and Google said I mean

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,100
again from Google's mouth please write

00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:26,540
your own take care of it do it right and

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,580
again stuff we've all known but we don't

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:33,050
necessarily always do I know I don't

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,880
always do it but we should so human

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,380
Trust isn't the same as Google trust so

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,240
we talked about how trusted sites are

00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,740
important what a human might trust is

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,660
not necessarily what Google might trust

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,280
a good example is the Better Business

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,510
Bureau you have a great score there and

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,730
that can help I'll trust your business

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,780
more if you're a great BBB score Google

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,640
doesn't count that kind of stuff at all

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,520
it's too easy to cheat and make it

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,620
different at so guk the things that will

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,880
help people trust your site are good to

00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,170
have in there good social proof you

00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,179
might get more sales Google's not going

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,410
to count that if you have a a-plus BBB

00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,290
ranking it's going to impact your search

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,660
results 0 again could help other people

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,910
still a good thing to do but things that

00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,760
are easy to gain like that are things

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:13,610
that Google tries not to trust as much

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,530
no this one was interesting to me so

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,360
nofollow gives publishers a way to focus

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,620
on content so

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
no follow links are what you can set up

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,410
a link in your site see I'm gonna link

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,270
over to Ashley site but Google don't

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,380
count that his link to her she paid for

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,240
promotion whatever there's there's

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,710
reasons you might do that in the past

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,480
few years a lot of big publications

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,830
Huffington Post and some of those just

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,299
no followed everything on their site

00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,710
which I thought that was stupid this is

00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:34,580
lazy you know these are there are any

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,650
good content there sharing good

00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,850
resources give the the link love out and

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,320
I still think it's kind of dumb but

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,110
Google made a good point about why that

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,059
might be so a username David wrote he

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,710
said quote I've always felt publications

00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,360
that nofollow all their links are waving

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,340
the white flag is it to say read it your

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,150
own risk we have no quality control look

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,410
yes I'm with you that that's it but John

00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,600
me only made a good response he said

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,250
quote either that or they just had it

00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,540
with folks asking for or sneaking in

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,950
links and want to have a way of just

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,270
focusing on their primary content

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,490
without having to worry about that part

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,660
that makes sense it makes discourages

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,010
spammers they can folks just a good

00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,630
content not worry about is this link

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,280
legit is that a spammer and

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,440
it's just all nofollow we're just good

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,120
content get it out so I still think it's

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,350
lazy but at least I kind of understand

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,760
why these big companies would do that

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:19,490
Wikipedia is the same they nofollow

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,679
everything you know so I understand why

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,940
so don't like it but I wouldn't

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,320
encourage any of you to do it it's worth

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,549
taking the time again we link to other

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,660
sites we check him out and say that's a

00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:27,770
great resource so gonna link to it we

00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,380
want them to get credit for the link and

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,330
rank better I guess maybe if we had a

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,799
huge company to be too much work but at

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,540
least I kind of now understand why they

00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:40,040
might do it it's not just laziness it's

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:41,270
just partially laziness Google doesn't

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,919
index pages that have been redirected

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,780
this is something they made just a point

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:46,010
to share but it kind of makes sense if

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,600
you have a page that's not there anymore

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,559
you redirect it somewhere else this page

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,919
will not show up in the search results

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,059
and that's okay nothing magic there the

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,799
one good thing if people link to that

00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,299
page we redirect those links will count

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,429
toward the new one so it all works out

00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:00,320
but this is not a good thing and really

00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,309
what would they index any has nothing

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,230
there to index if they get redirected

00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:04,640
they can't even see it so just something

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,110
something Google shared again trying to

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,429
share share the things that Google is

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,120
said this year and that was one that was

00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:12,320
interesting this one yeah kind of kind

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,299
of talked to Jenny's talks when we went

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,679
there if you didn't see Jenny's talk

00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,419
this morning look on WordPress that TV

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,220
because this is nice but position 0 the

00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,929
you have the main 10 results and some

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,330
ads but the quick answers at the top are

00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,559
becoming a much much bigger deal and

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,059
some searches you know now result

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,830
there's even some I've seen where there

00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:29,150
are no answers like no results shows

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,950
just here's your answer to what you

00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,870
wanted and that's it

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,220
this really could be trouble an example

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,230
I saw was if you search for a date in

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,370
London like I wanted to find a date I'm

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,690
gonna go out on a date in London

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,500
Google's say no no I know the date in

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,230
London yes

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,370
May 5th I got that and so if you have

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,840
the right kind of keywords that Google

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,880
doesn't quite get it could be could be a

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,080
big trouble so this is theoretically

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,180
where that neural matching all that

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,170
stuff Google does should help if they

00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,490
know you've been looking at tinder and

00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,410
stuff first I always looking for a date

00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,030
not that kind of thing but we'll see

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,470
interesting to watch and Jenny gave some

00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,640
good tools this morning on how to watch

00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,930
that stuff in your site it's worth

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,700
keeping an eye on because more and more

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,110
Google is giving the answer in this

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,580
hangout if you want more here's more

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,230
stuff down here but you know make sure

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,550
it's not not hosing you too bad because

00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,960
that's only gonna get bigger because

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,670
that position zero stuff is what they

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,590
answer with the Google assistant we say

00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,850
how tall is Tom Cruise is they pull that

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,860
position zero because it has the answer

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,420
in it so that's only gonna become more

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,430
widespread as the voice stuff gets

00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,110
bigger so again check out Jenny's talk

00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,540
and her slides and stuff for more on

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,770
that one

00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,080
Google's tips for dealing with seasonal

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,160
content so seasonal content can be

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,600
tricky an aside if you have your

00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,830
Christmas hours that come and then they

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,900
go and they don't matter so much

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,430
Google have a few good suggestions for

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,710
that one is one I'd use before and one I

00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,300
thought was new one suggestion they have

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,040
is you have a page called special hours

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,600
and just update that throughout the year

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,770
with hey here's our Thanksgiving hours

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,820
and now here's our Christmas hours that

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,680
kind of thing so you know how they page

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,120
that you create wait for Google to index

00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,530
it hope it gets ranked and then you

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,020
delete it and he's always had that

00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,340
special hours page that changes what I

00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,560
do when I worked at a church I don't

00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,790
think John is in here but what we did

00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,410
the church that made a page for a

00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,640
Vacation Bible School and just left it

00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,980
up year-round we kind of tuck it away

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,270
maybe not as obvious in the winter but

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,770
that way that one page is always there

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,690
and then the summer we kind of bring it

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,100
out get it updated with info and Google

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,240
said wow this one page has been here for

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,860
years we know what it's about we're

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,380
familiar with it it would rank very very

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,910
well versus creating a page for VBS 2018

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,860
and then deleting it making a new page

00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,080
in 2019 if you have seasonal stuff if

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,090
you can somehow keep the same page up

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,920
year-round in a way that's good for your

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,460
users that can be a very good thing to

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,680
do Google says it's good to have unique

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,420
images on your pages this is really more

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,120
about UX than search google says this

00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,530
isn't gonna impact your search directly

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,000
and they were clear that they said quote

00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,290
it's not the case that if you have good

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,300
images that will make your site rank

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,500
better in web search but it's good for

00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,360
users you have unique images on the

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,340
pages properly sourced images that

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,480
you're not stealing from someone but

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,070
Google said yes have you

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,240
images is a good thing for users and

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,809
good things for users are good things

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,950
for them which is good for you

00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,480
now don't worry about keywords in your

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,610
URLs we've talked about this a bit they

00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,870
still can matter a bit but not nearly as

00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,429
much as they used to and John Mueller

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,980
said quote I wouldn't worry about

00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:03,440
keywords or words in a URL in many cases

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,520
URLs aren't seen by users anyhow and it

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,990
seems like with Chrome they're kind of

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,610
taking away more there's actually some

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,720
test versions out now where you don't

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,710
see the address bar you just kind of

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,570
browse around and do what you need if

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,860
you want to expose it you can but it's

00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,570
being hidden more and more to users

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,770
especially in mobile so Google's saying

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,270
why should we care what keywords are in

00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,799
the address of the page it's more about

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,270
what's on the page and that's been

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,580
coming for years and it makes sense and

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,320
again Google said specifically with a

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,240
quote it doesn't matter that much so I

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,770
would I would listen to that now to say

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,080
keywords are bad in a URL but having a

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,460
big long address isn't that useful

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,230
you know big long page name if you just

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,890
just be to the point get it done help

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:39,320
people find it there's no such thing as

00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,630
negative keywords in organic search this

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,890
is again kind of obvious one once you

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,630
think about it it seems kind of weird at

00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,070
first so if you do Google ads at all

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,059
negative keywords are huge you want to

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,980
use those a lot to make sure you're not

00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:50,360
getting you know the wrong people coming

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,590
up they're paying for clicks on there's

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,850
no such thing in organic search you

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,040
can't say hey Google this page is about

00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,350
blue widgets but not green ones you

00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,640
can't tell Google that they what you can

00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,960
do they'll really just make it focused

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,250
on blue widgets and some assertions for

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,330
green ones it's not gonna come up

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,100
they're gonna find other ones but

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,059
there's no way wait a client asked us

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,650
it's like how do we filter out the

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:09,440
negative keywords on this page and you

00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,059
don't really thankfully in a roundabout

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,049
way it's hard to rank anyhow and for

00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,790
Google a lot of things so you're

00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:16,610
unlikely to rank for the wrong things as

00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,169
it is but no real way to technically do

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,630
that there's not a meta tag or something

00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:24,200
with negative keywords stick tuned for

00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:26,750
ads for sure though Google already knows

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,640
about your shady links so there's a way

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,320
to disavow links in Google say hey

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,000
Google I know this spammy sites linking

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,470
to me please don't count it anymore and

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
there's ways to disavow that that's a

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,929
good thing to do and now there's tools

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,040
out there so hey we're gonna help you

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,450
find those shady links and submit

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,850
disavows to Google and that's not bad

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,380
but John Mueller says ultimately if some

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,000
random tool can tell you which ones to

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,919
disavow they're probably already being

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,270
ignored so you know finding those tools

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,500
are great but Google's probably already

00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,250
smarter probably artists often say yeah

00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,020
we know their spammer

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,190
we don't care don't worry about it we

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,720
don't really do a lot to even deal with

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,429
disallowing links in our site it can be

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,510
a good thing to do I don't know if Jenny

00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,070
and some of the others do that or not

00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,270
but it's usually not worth the f

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,230
but if you find the tool it says hey

00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,430
we're gonna help you find those bad

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,990
links and help you submit them to Google

00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,520
so they know about it Google says come

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,210
on we probably already know don't don't

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,430
waste your time there are no Google

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,620
partner SEO agencies so there's a lot of

00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,670
google partner programs out there Jenny

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,140
mentioned this morning she's a ad

00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,730
partner you should look into them

00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,710
there's great great to get great to

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,900
learn great to advertise but if you say

00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,190
I'm a Google Google SEO partner it

00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,810
doesn't exist there's not such a thing

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,170
if someone tells you they are they're

00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,760
lying

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,410
that's just something Google's come up

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,800
against cuz people say that a lot and

00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:32,630
there's not not such a thing your

00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,770
contacts can't require a link to your

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,720
site and this was interesting we were

00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,740
talking to a client and they had another

00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,090
coming they were talking in their

00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,170
contracts and part of the contract we

00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,430
will put a link at the bottom your site

00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,230
that links back to ours and Google says

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,300
you cannot do that or you should not I

00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,800
guess you can do whatever you want but

00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,000
part of their link schemes what they

00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,070
define is a link scheme they say

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,870
requiring a link as part of a Terms of

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,580
Service contract or similar arrangement

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,770
without allowing a third party content

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,300
owner the choice of using nofollow or

00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,400
other methods of blocking PageRank

00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,020
should they wish is a link scheme so if

00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,950
you say in your contract hey if you want

00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,020
to put a link in the bottom the sites

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,520
you build that's fine I don't think we

00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,930
should be doing that as developers but

00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,580
that's up to you but if you have it in

00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,680
your contract Google says that violates

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,300
our guidelines they probably never see

00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,860
it but again you should do the right

00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,790
thing because it's the right thing and

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:20,000
that's not the right thing don't pretend

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:22,340
that 404s are 301 and this is one I've

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,050
been guilty of in the past so 404s of

00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,330
course being a broken page google says

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,770
404 not found an easy solution people

00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,630
said hey any broken page in the site

00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,830
just redirect to the home page that way

00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,690
they don't ever see the broken page

00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,280
Google says not to do that because it

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,900
confuses them and again confusing Google

00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,850
is a bad thing to do so you should

00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,320
either leave them as 404 say hey sorry

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,730
you found this page here's a sitemap

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,410
here's a search box help it do it the

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,910
right way or if you know it's a broken

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,160
page you can set up a 301 to the proper

00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,420
new page again we get over the history

00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,950
of our company page we'll do a redirect

00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,170
to the about page that's the closest

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,430
thing to it I'm just saying all blanket

00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,870
all the broken ones just go to the home

00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,640
page that way no broken links on our

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,900
site that's just gonna confuse Google

00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,000
because I thought this page was of that

00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,050
and I was thinking here and confusion is

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,460
a bad thing and they've said

00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,460
specifically please don't do that

00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,160
so I said I talked about image URLs

00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,460
Google says not to change image URLs

00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,990
this is tricky because if you upload an

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,700
image to the site they should be named

00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,500
something other than DSC one seven nine

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,380
six you should name it you know pretty

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,520
green flower or whatever but if it's

00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,050
already on the site with the bad name

00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,180
already indexed and already they're

00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,530
changing names Google basically starts

00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,970
over with that image says okay the old

00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,440
image is gone and I'm gonna index the

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,390
new one it'll make its way up it might

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,620
show up an image search later so if you

00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,720
get good stuff from image searching

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,550
you're doing okay changing image names

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,250
to be better may not be worth the hit

00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:40,070
you'll take in the meantime again the

00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,570
image is kind of go back to zero in yeah

00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,740
image search doesn't matter a lot for a

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,110
lot of us but it's something to consider

00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,930
certainly be careful that ahead of time

00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:49,310
but yeah oh cool but yeah I wouldn't

00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,570
necessarily change the old ones to make

00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:54,050
it better because you may cause other

00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:56,690
problems your site needs content to rank

00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,000
well okay this kind of makes sense but

00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,620
the users asked he said quote there are

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,480
zero issues on our website according to

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,190
the search console we're providing fast

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,900
performance in mobile and great UX I'm

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,610
not sure what to do to improve next and

00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,260
so John Mueller gave a really long

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,360
answer I'm gonna shorten it to a medium

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,010
length answer he said quote this is

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,150
always kind of a tricky situation where

00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,500
you're working in your website for a

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,820
while then sometimes you focus on a lot

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,340
of the technical details I'm figuring

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,570
but forget about the bigger picture

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,710
another thing to keep in mind is that

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,300
just because something is technically

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,770
correct doesn't mean that it's relevant

00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,600
to users in the search results that

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,830
doesn't mean it will rank high so if you

00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,600
clean up your website and you fix all

00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,010
the issues for example if your website

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,170
contains a lot of terrible content then

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,040
it still won't rank that high so we all

00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,030
spend a lot of time we're getting

00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,200
technical stuff on our site that's

00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,850
important to do it should load fast

00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,410
should have SSL should have the right

00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,940
tags in place but if it's bad content

00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,500
you're still done Google's not going to

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,000
show that bad content to people so I

00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,720
mean that should be the first thing you

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,310
worry about links continue to be a major

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,720
ranking factor this is something you

00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,010
know google says I hate or people say

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,990
PageRank is dead links don't matter

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,930
links still do matter quite a lot it's a

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,880
trickier thing to do but it's a good

00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,740
thing to keep in mind so the folks at

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,180
stone temple consulting an SEO firm that

00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,890
has a lot of good things they'd want

00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,940
great insightful reason they offered why

00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,070
Google is going to think links are

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,960
important they said quote a non

00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,910
advertisement link on your site is an

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,620
indication by you as the publisher of

00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,390
the page that you think the link has

00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,950
enough value to your visitors and will

00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,300
do enough to enhance your relationship

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,310
with those visitors that you're willing

00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,080
to have people leave your site so if

00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,640
Google they're saying Google must

00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,380
respect these outbound links and again

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,580
with our blog we link out to other sites

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,950
we're saying hey read

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,450
this is good info that's worth we're

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,830
worth losing you to that site for it

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,059
because it's such a good resource and

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,239
hopefully you'll remember us because of

00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,190
that

00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:35,749
I used to write for a site called Google

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,009
Earth blog all about cool stuff in

00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:39,169
Google Earth and every day was basically

00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:40,460
here's this cool thing now go check it

00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:42,289
out and everything is just sending

00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,700
people away from us but Google loved us

00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,539
they linked to us and people would come

00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,669
back because they knew we would have

00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:47,029
good content so links aren't going

00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:48,499
anywhere

00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:50,600
Google's kind of said that but I thought

00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:53,840
that was an interesting quote from stone

00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,309
temple consulting how long can you keep

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,389
redirects in place if you set up a

00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,159
redirect for one patient another how

00:33:56,389 --> 00:34:00,889
long should you leave it there Google

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,179
says quote a few years is good but

00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:03,710
really leave them up as long as possible

00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:04,820
you never know what old links might

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,289
point to it if you have a redirect

00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,149
there's no reason to ever take it down

00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:09,349
but really after really after a couple

00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:10,970
weeks Google knows about it's kind of

00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:12,200
done their job but I was leave it up

00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,190
just in case there's some old bookmarks

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,720
or something pointing there I want to

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,450
make sure those people always get to the

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,859
right place so there's no time limit but

00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:24,139
Google says a few years is good if

00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,669
Google mistaken things mistakenly thinks

00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:28,849
all your pages are the same it could be

00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:31,220
trouble so this seems obvious but it

00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:32,899
happens more than you think so even if

00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,000
you have canonical set up for your site

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,079
to tell Google what's going on Google

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,790
could still get confused you know

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
Canonical's are great to explain those

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,609
again like if you have here's our

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,559
products and then we do questions sort

00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:44,210
equals name and here's our product sort

00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,530
equals color it's the same content just

00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,210
sort of different ways but it's two

00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,829
separate pages so canonical says hey

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,359
it's just this one product if we have

00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:52,250
these different sorting here's the main

00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:53,720
one but the issue can be if you have

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,339
JavaScript on your page that's required

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,720
to see the content the JavaScript breaks

00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:57,890
and all the pages look the same or

00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,510
Google can't handle it Google is going

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,520
to think they're all the same and you're

00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,480
in big trouble so if somehow Google

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,740
thinks all your pages are the same

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,880
because you got too fancy with something

00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:09,410
it's clearly gonna be an issue

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,390
Google posts can still be valuable in

00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,160
Google my business I they have a post

00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,329
feature that was huge when they launched

00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,500
it a year or two ago it's kind of

00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:17,480
diminished some now but it's still

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,829
valuable we've been doing that a bit

00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,030
more with clients we had one client that

00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:22,520
had some issues with his Google my

00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,530
business page and one of the reasons is

00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,150
hard to ever talk to directly so that's

00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,290
why I like pulling the stuff out I tried

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,299
to talk to him directly he got different

00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,440
stories and why they had an issue of the

00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:32,299
page and one said because you didn't

00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,470
update the page often enough like well

00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,270
it was accurate lo what did I need to

00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,710
update so now we're publishing all this

00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,900
blog post as Google post they're doing

00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,010
relatively little to help but a little

00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,059
could be good but also is keeping the

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,609
page fresh and hopefully we'll keep

00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:45,640
Google's moderators happy it's worth a

00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,640
shot

00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,119
how old content cannot rake your fresh

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,710
content so you know people get upset

00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,789
with a say I wrote this great post about

00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,710
this thing and this post from three

00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:56,089
years ago still out ranking it we talked

00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,010
before being fresh doesn't mean it's

00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:59,510
good and the old old one probably has

00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,130
some links pointing to it and lots of

00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,599
signals so Google's learn to trust that

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,460
more so if you're upset that old old

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,720
cons that's out ranking it that's not

00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,250
necessarily bad and that's you know

00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,670
again it's got that history he's got the

00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:13,309
links it could be a good thing they're a

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:15,859
few more here this was interesting HTTPS

00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:17,930
is a soft ranking factor Google said so

00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:19,520
John Mueller said HTTPS is a ranking

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,380
factor first which we all know that SSL

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,359
is their ranking factor he said quote

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,760
but it's really kind of a soft ranking

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,529
factor a really small ranking factor so

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,520
when you hear people say you need SSL

00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:30,319
Google's then kicked out of the index

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,670
you don't I mean you should have SSL

00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:34,309
there's definitely no reason not to with

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,049
every most every host it's free to have

00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:37,369
you should do it but don't expect big

00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:38,510
changes to your rankings because of it

00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:40,670
it's just a little boost it's gonna help

00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,900
I think it'll help more and more as time

00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,609
progresses but Google's made it clear

00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,920
yes it's a ranking factor you're all

00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:47,480
correct but just a little bit but again

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,130
most things that CEO was just a little

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,690
bit set add up so let's throw that one

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,740
in the pot because it's free and it

00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,819
makes things look better people don't

00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,079
see they're not secure in your page

00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:57,789
there's a lot of good reasons to do it

00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,380
but as a ranking factor it's pretty soft

00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:02,420
similarly HTTPS isn't required to rank

00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,339
on Google there was an article that said

00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,809
without an SSL certificate Google is

00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:07,789
likely to drop your website and search

00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,190
results John Mueller replied to that

00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:12,799
specifically said yeah that's wrong

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:14,240
HTTPS is a let's say HTTPS is not a

00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:16,849
factor in deciding whether or not to

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,589
index a page at all we do use HTTPS is a

00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,170
lightweight ranking factor and having

00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:22,339
HTTPS is it is great for users so when

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,240
they're going around indexing pages

00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,500
they're not looking at all they're gonna

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,180
index all your pages whether they're

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,230
secure or not and then they'll factor in

00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,369
the rankings a little bit but not gonna

00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,559
drop you from the index or do anything

00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:32,660
bad yet I mean a couple years that's

00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,309
very likely to change but for now it's

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:38,029
not critical but again you still should

00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:39,049
all do it there's no time frame for

00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,490
ranking changes after you make

00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,900
improvements and this is frustrating I

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,910
think we've all probably seen this but

00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,170
you make you know you have some issues

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,460
to do especially after a word camps at

00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,869
grab-and-go working on my content you do

00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,329
it this week and then nothing really

00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:51,430
changes for a week or two John Mueller

00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:53,500
quote from him he says

00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,210
as with anything related to web search

00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,099
it's not something where there's a fixed

00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,290
time frame involved but rather we crawl

00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,460
and index pages over time we update the

00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,559
signals we have for those pages over

00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,640
time so continue working continue doing

00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,260
your thing and it'll help over time

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,059
there's not wait two weeks it's gonna

00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,260
make a difference maybe two months you

00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:09,490
know depends on how much they crawl

00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,740
what's going on but there's never a

00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,660
fixed timeframe for changes good or bad

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,680
you may make changes that hurt your site

00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,670
and you won't see that for a while

00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,480
either and that could be troublesome

00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,550
google revealed a bit more about

00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,839
rankbrain so Gary Isles is the other one

00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,069
Gary Isles and John Mueller the two

00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,010
Google people that tweet a lot and

00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:28,329
actually share stuff with the public so

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,740
he said so you've heard about rankbrain

00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:33,010
just a bit from what he said it is

00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,170
ranked Brady's APR sexy machine learning

00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,030
ranking component they use a historical

00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,710
search data to predict what a user would

00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,079
most likely click on for a previously

00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,160
unseen query we'll talk more about that

00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,270
in a little bit it's basically saying

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,859
we're gonna look at what you search for

00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,359
before what other people have and use

00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,339
that kind of influence what's going on

00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,720
with subsequent searches but is there a

00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:51,160
lot of things searched in Google every

00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,420
day that Google's never seen before they

00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,680
need to have results for quickly and

00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,390
rank brains one of their algorithms

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,799
tries to figure out okay what kind of

00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,839
stuff you look for before and they do a

00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:00,880
tremendous amount of work in a tenth of

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,170
a second to pull that back for you and

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,859
we'll talk more about this in just a sec

00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:07,299
to using href Lang won't improve your

00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:10,030
rankings but could help bring Berner

00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:11,829
traffic so hrf Lang is a thing to say

00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,970
hey Google that what language is paging

00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,859
I have an English version of German

00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,089
version and whatever is going on this

00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:18,490
has helped Google understand your site

00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:20,559
like that there you go

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,329
Gary Isle says quote you will not

00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:23,920
receive a ranking benefit per se at

00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,750
least not in the internal sense of the

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,920
term so you want to explain that if you

00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,089
have HRF Lang you have multiple

00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,309
languages on your site it's a good thing

00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:32,920
to have but Google works very to past

00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:33,910
process for every page first they look

00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,470
for the page that has the strongest

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,030
signals the links the traditional SEO

00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,589
stuff title tags all that kind of stuff

00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,700
figure out what they're gonna rank and

00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:41,260
then they look to see if they have a

00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,210
sibling page with the same content but

00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,619
in a proper language and spit that out

00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,150
so it's not like multiple languages will

00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:48,609
help a ton you're still gonna be ranked

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,049
on the stuff you're ranked on but once

00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:51,640
you they say you're ranked here and now

00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:54,130
you have a better language for that page

00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,380
it's going to certainly help but doesn't

00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,119
directly impact your rankings certainly

00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,890
a good thing to do though if you can get

00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,130
well-written foreign content and all

00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:04,960
your pages Google is begging you to just

00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,410
stick to the basics and so they see this

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,940
a lot

00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,080
Twitter and stuff with Google people

00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,310
making all these things I want to try

00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,080
these weird wacky things there's so many

00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:13,420
just a few basics you can do that can

00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,430
can do a great job Gary aisle said quote

00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,020
I really wish SEO went back to the

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,580
basics instead of focusing on silly

00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,290
updates and made-up terms by the rank

00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,640
trackers and then they talk more with

00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,870
the developers of the website once done

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,910
with the first part of that sentence

00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,470
another user asked Gary about his

00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,600
favorite SEO conspiracy theory and he

00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,770
said quote I don't have a favorite they

00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,180
generally make me want to crawl into a

00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,680
corner and cry because we don't do a

00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,030
good enough job getting people to focus

00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,190
on the important things like creating a

00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,330
damn crawlable website so people are

00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,560
worried about little things and chips

00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,180
and tricks just make it so Google and

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,560
crawl it can understand it you're gonna

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,510
be way ahead of most people at that

00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,770
point and sticking the basics I mean

00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,180
Google's literally begging like please

00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,340
just get the basics right cuz there's so

00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,920
many issues out there just work right in

00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,480
you're in good shape

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,210
porn eNOS is a ranking factor this was

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,760
funny when who said it Gary said it so

00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,500
when Google CEO sundar pichai testified

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,120
in front of Congress a few months ago he

00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,710
said that Google uses over 200 ranking

00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,510
signals but only mentioned three of them

00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,250
relevance freshness and popularity are

00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,140
big ones that certainly can help in

00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,210
there so user asked Gary Isles what

00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,830
other stuff might be and Gary's quote

00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,300
was quote country you know what other

00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:15,070
ranking factors might be out of the 200

00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,170
said quote the country the site is local

00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:20,320
to rankbrain PageRank

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,240
links language horniness etc so this is

00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,260
where I mean Google looks at porn kind

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,940
of sites and they don't want them to

00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,230
come up for things so if you use the

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,850
right kind of colorful language on your

00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,170
site you could make Google think you're

00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,850
not the kind of site you really are and

00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,830
could be a factor so that is one of

00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,690
Google's 200 factors and that's the word

00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,570
they used to describe it so I thought

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,980
that was kind of funny you can link

00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:42,190
internally as much as you want with no

00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,570
fear of penalty so a user asked quote is

00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,490
there an internal linking over

00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,870
optimization penalty I'm not talking

00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,910
about keyword stuffing the anchor text

00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,380
but using a relevant anchor repeatedly

00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,630
and adding internal links from relevant

00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,160
pages in batches to a specific page is

00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,900
it possible this is interpreted by

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,490
Google as manipulative even it's just

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,130
internal ranking among you know pages to

00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:01,450
other pages on your site google's gary

00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,430
answered that one it was pretty short

00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,840
and simply said quote no you can abuse

00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,580
your internal links as much as you want

00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,960
as far as I know so you should be

00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,130
internal linking a lot and you can't

00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,420
really overdo it if you're always

00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,340
referencing people to other pages on

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,660
your site with good info go for it you

00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,610
absolutely should be doing it and Google

00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,050
says you can't really overdo it now from

00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,060
user perspective you could you've seen

00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,370
pages that like every other

00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,990
that's just looks dumb to us Google's

00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,640
not going to penalize you but if you

00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,680
find a place where you have a lot of

00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,950
links and it's okay Google's good with

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,080
that don't break the rules just because

00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,550
your competition does a user complained

00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,650
about competitor breaking the rules and

00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,060
out ranking them John Mueller said quote

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,890
they might be ranking well despite these

00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,660
things not because of them no need to

00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,220
copy their bad practices when you know

00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,570
better so you may see someone our

00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,860
rankings say other not ranking me and

00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,060
they're doing the shady thing to do it

00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,900
that might not be why they're not

00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,610
ranking they might have more links

00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,600
different content don't copy the shady

00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:52,620
thing trying to rank better because then

00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:54,180
it may just hurt you even worse fake

00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,010
edits to Google Maps listing can cause

00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,180
big trouble and I have no good answer

00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,010
for this one because that's becoming a

00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,390
growing issue where people are faking

00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,530
edits and saying this business is closed

00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,900
when they're really not and all that

00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,280
Google is working on it but just keep an

00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,750
eye on your local business listings if

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,520
you do that we're we're a lot keeping a

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,450
much closer eye on the clients we manage

00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,040
for that because there's not a good

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,870
answer for that claim it control it but

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,580
it's it's still a big problem that

00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:17,580
Google is working on and one you should

00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,050
be keeping a close eye on don't use UTM

00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,740
parameters on internal links so you've

00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,690
seen these before

00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,040
where has like UTM source and that kind

00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,090
of thing those are great for tracking

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,290
what's going on but if you do it

00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,700
internally because you're lazy like

00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,690
here's the one I use to point Facebook

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,520
I'm gonna use it on my site just to

00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,810
point this other page Google says don't

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,700
do that it's just confusing them again

00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,860
if you confuse Google it's not good and

00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,790
that's a way to confuse Google so if

00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,960
you're gonna link your about page in

00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,520
trollese link to about if you can post

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,410
on a Facebook go for it use the

00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:45,330
parameters but don't do those internally

00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,310
once again click-through rate does not

00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,630
affect rankings and this came up again

00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,700
because Matt Cutts who used to kind of

00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,990
be the voice of Google in 2009 was

00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,580
talking about bounce ranks and rankings

00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,980
and said bounce rate so we're not all be

00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,910
spammable but noisy so saying if we

00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,040
looked at the search results for who

00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,940
clicked on something and came back

00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,120
should we factor they said no it'd be

00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,520
too hard to factor that stuff in but

00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,470
Google in another document said let's

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,610
see they said quote for example when you

00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,770
click a link in Google search Google

00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,180
considers your click when ranking that

00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,830
search result in future query so you

00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,360
think oh so they are counting that click

00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,680
for a future queries they said no no

00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,150
they're kind of that click for your

00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,650
future queries if I click on something

00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,300
they're gonna factor that in when I

00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,680
search again but having all your friends

00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,000
go click on your sites I'm gonna make it

00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,960
come up higher for them and not really

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,770
for anyone else don't just stick content

00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,330
at the bottom of your e-commerce

00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,890
category pages you know we see an

00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,420
e-commerce category pages all the price

00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,799
I think we need some content on let's

00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,380
just cram a bunch of the bottom and

00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:38,789
Google said specifically please don't

00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:40,109
target comm is a great example of this

00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:42,059
they used to do that these two have a

00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:43,890
bunch of junk to the bottom now if you

00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:45,480
go to most target pages you'll see hey

00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,500
welcome to the baby section here's a

00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,730
little bit about how great it is how

00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,019
great our products are here's a featured

00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,490
product and now here's a list of all the

00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,720
stuff so they get some good content in a

00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:55,079
more proper way rather than just

00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,220
cramming it all at the bottom Jenny

00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,599
mentioned this this morning too but

00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,430
working on mobile PageSpeed isn't a

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,839
one-time fix speeds gonna degrade over

00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,180
time you're gonna add new plugins to add

00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,589
more content hosting might degrade pay

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,359
tens do it regularly speed is a great

00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,710
thing but keep an eye on it and always

00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:10,740
be tweaking to get little bit faster or

00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,029
at least not be getting slower now

00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,549
google explains a bit more about how

00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:16,710
javascript is indexed so martin split

00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:19,349
from google has a web series now talking

00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,640
about SEO stuff it was interesting with

00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,859
javascript because javascript is coming

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,450
in a lot more but javascript eva page

00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:25,950
lots of java they index it in two steps

00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,660
they first look at just all the text and

00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,980
index that and later when they get

00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,900
around to it they look at the JavaScript

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,970
stuff and index that he said they've

00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,490
seen a 130 trillion pages on the web

00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,720
that they've seen so far so deferring

00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,160
something that the later helps them just

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,990
to get it all done so if you rely on

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,279
that JavaScript to rank well because it

00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,539
has some content in it that could be

00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:44,369
trouble you make sure your concept shows

00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,869
up in that first pass javascript can do

00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:47,519
some neat things and help with UX and

00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:50,849
all that but it could be trouble with

00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:52,140
how Google indexes it there's a redirect

00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:53,279
linking hack going around you should all

00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,170
do because it make you rank better by

00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,910
cheating but it really doesn't work it

00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,259
was kind of weird people saying for a

00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,059
while you buy a new domain name and

00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:01,349
generate lots of links to that thing and

00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:03,089
then redirect it over to your main site

00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:04,890
and all those links to follow it which

00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:06,690
is true but you could just build those

00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,430
links to the site instead of doing all

00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,390
that Google didn't really understand why

00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,740
people were doing that how it was

00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,970
supposed to help but it was the hot

00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:16,470
thing for a few months ago so if you

00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:18,539
hear that it's dumb adding keywords to

00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,859
CSS is meaningless this is a real CSS

00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:21,990
file someone submitted said fire risk

00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:24,960
assessment phone number like trying to

00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,279
put keywords in CSS Google said they

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,599
just don't look at that they don't care

00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:29,099
about that at all and really in general

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,660
what they can't see like what a user

00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,240
can't see isn't gonna count for anything

00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:36,660
so that's an innovative way to try to

00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,339
get keywords in but know your images

00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,869
don't need to be on your domain this was

00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:41,640
interesting Google said first there's no

00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:43,319
SEO bonus for any images on your own

00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,640
domain name so if you have images that

00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,270
pull in from somewhere else that's fine

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,160
they can still

00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,900
Frank well the key is though if you move

00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,220
them if you change the location of an

00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,660
image that can be a killer because again

00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,460
it's like a brand new image essentially

00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,770
we talk about renaming so they're saying

00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,420
if you use a CDN there's ways to do it

00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,700
where it's like CDN dot your site name

00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,530
com you do like a cname record to make

00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,330
it look like it's on your site versus

00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,920
using there so if you ever changed CBN's

00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,240
in the future it's easier that's getting

00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,590
a little technical but if you use the

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,100
CDN and you really program it yourself

00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:12,420
we can talk about best ways to do that

00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,980
but images if you do pull them in from

00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,960
somewhere else on a CDN or some other

00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,220
network that's perfectly fine they don't

00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,650
give you a bonus for keeping them on

00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,500
your own site videos are great for SEO

00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,390
they need tech support John Mueller said

00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,860
quote just purely using a video on a

00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,720
page is something that at least from a

00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,980
web search point of view makes it really

00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,720
hard for us to determine what is

00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,220
actually useful on this page and why we

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,360
should show the search results that's

00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,860
true if you just stick a video on the

00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,150
page they need context around that to

00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,440
help it rank better and they probably

00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,990
already have that same video in YouTube

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,630
so give some context around videos to

00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:43,860
help them rank better there's no limit

00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,390
to the traffic that Google will send to

00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,700
your site John Mueller said quote

00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,840
there's no organic traffic budget we try

00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,070
to show pages in search when our

00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,690
algorithms think they're relevant not

00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,620
based on counters then you get a bunch

00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,300
of traffic we name anything well

00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,440
Google's gonna tire out of sending me

00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,430
stuff now if you're the best dancer it's

00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,200
gonna keep sending you traffic all day

00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,150
which is a problem most of us would love

00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,320
to have but don't ever worry about that

00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,730
they're gonna send the best results

00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,980
regardless of how many times they've

00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,240
sent people there before we're almost

00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,820
out of time and I'm almost done so this

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,860
should work out pretty well here either

00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,620
use a mobile URL or a responsive design

00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,880
not both and so there's ways to have you

00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,200
know most of us have responsive designs

00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,150
kind of bends and flexes with the main

00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,710
thing or you have an MDOT your site comm

00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,840
that's a separate one and that's okay

00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,610
too not as good but works don't do both

00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,080
don't have a response separate mobile

00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,850
site and responsive one because it

00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,920
confuses Google John Mueller said quote

00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,930
we'd probably get confused which one

00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,910
should we show when it's unclear I'd

00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:36,150
strongly recommend using a single URL

00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:37,800
set up typically responsive design so he

00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,150
likes that we like that word press most

00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,280
themes do that out of the box it's a

00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,420
good thing to do

00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,890
there's no ranking bonus for Google

00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,510
partners again Google partner programs

00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,040
are great but if you're a Google partner

00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,600
you get zero ranking bonus for that

00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,520
they're not gonna do that based on you

00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,230
being a partner they literally give zero

00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,820
zero ranking bonus to Google partners

00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,050
now if you're a partner you study that

00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,550
stuff you probably good techniques you

00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:59,180
probably should rank better anyhow but

00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:00,990
not because you're a partner

00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,880
redirects are treated differently than

00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,930
links so this is kind of like if you

00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,400
link from one page to another it's

00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:08,220
different than if you redirect one page

00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,960
to another a link kind of gives that

00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,910
page a bonus where a redirect is gonna

00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,410
pass any other links over they work

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,960
similarly but Google said they don't

00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,610
treat them quite the same but again you

00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,350
should never confuse one for the other

00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:22,680
one have a case for one it's different

00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:24,030
than a case for the other Google ad is

00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,530
adding short URLs for Google my business

00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,120
that they say is rolling out now I

00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,010
haven't seen anywhere but soon it'll be

00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,330
kind of nice instead of your stupid long

00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:33,000
like here's my page and Google my

00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:34,680
business it'll be GA / your business

00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,300
name and to leave a review jitta page

00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,980
less your business name slash reviews

00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,900
that's gonna be great you'll see it in

00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,100
your Google my business soon but they

00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,470
say it's rolling out I haven't seen it

00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,570
I'm looking forward to it

00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,590
texting block quotes as normal text if

00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,790
you have a block quote on your site

00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,810
pulling something out Google says great

00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,160
they're gonna read it just like other

00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,600
text they won't necessarily treat it

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,890
differently because it may be something

00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,970
for your citing maybe from another site

00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,500
Google doesn't know so there's gonna

00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:56,550
treat it differently don't think I'm

00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,140
gonna put this in a block quote to make

00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,120
Google see it more like now they'll read

00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,330
it but no bonus they'll see what's going

00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,740
on Google ads and Google Analytics do

00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,210
not affect rankings we've heard this for

00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,190
years if you pay for Google ads it's

00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:09,420
gonna help your organic traffic go up so

00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,240
Danny Sullivan who recently joined

00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,800
Google is now sharing some things

00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:16,260
someone asks do Google ads impact that

00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,030
he said quote no we have ads every

00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,380
search you show will show ads however as

00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,850
for our search results that are

00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,320
completely independent of our ads we

00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:24,600
don't give advertisers any preference

00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,070
Google Analytics is also separate from

00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,480
Google search we don't make use of that

00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,650
at all it wouldn't make any sense it's

00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,630
not all sites use it and it's not

00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,100
representative so Google ads are great

00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,600
to do having analytics is great to do

00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:36,240
they have no impact on how you're

00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,100
ranking Google and then last one

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,360
don't focus on specific ranking factors

00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,250
this kind of ties in with the previous

00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,780
one even if you think I did some ads and

00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,550
now I'm ranking better haha that that

00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,410
shows that it works there's 200 other

00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,390
things that could have happened so John

00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,520
said here quote you can't really isolate

00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:52,050
any if X then Y elements everything's

00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,970
kind of related it can have cross factor

00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,290
effects doesn't have to all this can

00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,480
change by the minute by the intent by

00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:58,770
the query location whatever and then a

00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,320
good quote to end on from user named

00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:03,360
Gareth he said a wise old SEO once told

00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,100
me there are two core truths in SEO want

00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,200
us to do lots of things well and to Stan

00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,430
never overreact so lots of other things

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,310
to do to something does happen just

00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:12,450
chill and it should get better so I love

00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:15,350
to take questions but we got

00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:20,250
yeah we're out of time here I think okay

00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:22,070
yeah you think cool awesome Cup thank

00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:25,249
