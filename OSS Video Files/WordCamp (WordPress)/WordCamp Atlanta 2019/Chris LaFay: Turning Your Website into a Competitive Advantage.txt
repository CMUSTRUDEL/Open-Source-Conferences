my name is Christopher I run a web

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,919
development business called classic city

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,630
consulting and I've been doing web

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,940
development web design marketing

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,030
branding the whole shebang since about

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,369
2004 I actually has a brief little bit

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,820
of history I actually started doing web

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,439
development in middle school and the

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,590
wayback machine didn't really like me

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,750
too much but I was able to find one of

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,179
my very first websites I ever created so

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,059
let's bring that back to like 2004 with

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,430
front page and bringing things to the

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,280
limit now that's what I'm that's what

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,390
I'm talking about um my brother and I

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,300
started up a little business together

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,980
called goldmine at the same time and if

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,809
you look that's a picture of him before

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,789
he got stressed out and had six kids and

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,980
that's me what I thought looking like

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,600
John Krasinski would get me dates and it

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:58,140
definitely did not so that was back when

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,809
the shag was popular but what we're

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,910
gonna talk about some today is we're

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,530
gonna kind of start off with where Web

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,560
Design is right now obviously we're all

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,090
the press people here and other things

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,070
and other editors have come up like

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,200
Squarespace and wigs and things of those

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,080
lines and so I'm gonna kind of establish

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
a baseline of where we're at and from

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,880
there I'm going to talk about and how

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,930
did you take this website that you have

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
whether you're building for your

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,420
customers and how do you kind of bring

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,100
it to the next level and not

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:33,440
but in terms of how you really unleash

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,750
yours or your customers unfair craft so

00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,640
to start off there was a time back in

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,979
early 2000 to give or take you either

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,750
knew how to do web development or you

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,380
didn't there wasn't this middle ground

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,640
of just being able to play with it so

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:53,340
your site either were really really good

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,470
or they sucked and then there was a

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,770
teeny tiny little middle ground of these

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,770
mediocre mediocre websites right because

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,229
there isn't just anybody dabbling in web

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,539
development around this time but then

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,979
what happens is we have this middle

00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:10,110
class of editors that come up WordPress

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,030
being one of them right Wix Squarespace

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,450
all these other page building software's

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,940
and that curve changes in terms of the

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,070
usability and just how customers

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,590
interact with sites don't you wrong you

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,830
still have your really good sites you

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,050
have your really firepit bad sites but

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,570
then now there's this big middle ground

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,790
of all these template aid sites that

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,670
look exactly the same as one another and

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:39,239
they don't really do anybody justice for

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,829
actually bringing in business so kind of

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,620
showcase this I went online and I found

00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,660
some examples of different sites

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,480
utilizing Squarespace Wix even WordPress

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,040
and so we ended by the way if any of

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,880
these example sites for y'all I

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:59,060
apologize totally not planned I just

00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,060
went on a random hunt so sorry

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,420
so here we have you know let's looks

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,340
like right about the basic elements here

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,140
we have a hamburger menu on the Left we

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,359
have a logo on the right we have some

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,420
icons and a really big oversized picture

00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,850
we've all seen this site before right

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,190
then we go here it's pretty much the

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,410
same thing here oh well they actually

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,930
here they put three in a row instead of

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,930
just one big one okay that's cool let's

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,310
go over here again big image hamburger

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,620
and the right logo at the top we're

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,150
talking all these same site designs and

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,949
don't get me wrong there's something to

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,730
be said about consistency and putting

00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,240
things in the correct locations but we

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,070
lose this you

00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,620
Niq factor for our customers when we are

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,790
putting everything in the same spots and

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,250
so here I'm just going to kind of flip

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,900
through a few more of just sites again

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,940
that look exactly the same and they're

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,580
not even built off the same template

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,280
even these are all built using different

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,950
templates different structures different

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,280
back-end editors but they all look the

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,990
same and so just by looking at this if

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,690
the logos were blacked out would you

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,720
have any idea what these sites are

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,430
probably not so I'm gonna go through and

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,350
even look dribble in the hands now this

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,300
is a little bit dated I will say but

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,890
even dribbling by hands look very

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,470
similar now they do serve the same

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,320
target audience but again there's this

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,210
lack of this trying to define what your

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,040
competitive advantages in the

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,500
marketplace and we're finding these

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,910
templates and structures that look good

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,030
they're all visually appealing sites we

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,240
can't say no to that but they're not

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,910
showcasing how you answer problems for

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,400
people they're just visual Appeals and

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,310
so the first step of how we solved this

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,400
is the UI and UX thing who all knows the

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,760
difference between UI and UX and yes

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,620
okay some of you okay so I'm not gonna

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,980
spend a lot of time on it but the very

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,470
basics of UI is how a site looks is it

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:02,130
pretty as easy to look at does it draw

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,590
attention well on the flip side user

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,540
experience is about can a user actually

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,190
used the site like my little clicker

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,050
here says next slide and previous slide

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,390
doesn't look pretty right but it does

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,660
exactly what I need it to do the user

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,860
experience on it is good so really one

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,620
of these first things that we need to

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,480
figure out relative to either your

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,360
company or the customers that you're

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,030
trying to build sites for is what is the

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,190
primary goal what is that action that

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,670
you're looking for them to take and make

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,290
it obvious so I want to pull up a site

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,940
about OneNote we all probably know

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,610
OneNote is it's Microsoft's note-taking

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,120
app right this is a dated screenshot of

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,590
OneNote but if you look at it they have

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,510
the company name or the program name

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,330
OneNote and they have the call to action

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,360
download the app that's great

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,430
looking at this what does this thing do

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,830
we have a picture of a notebook and a

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,169
pencil but where does it say that you

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,789
can take notes digitally online accessed

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:04,860
across all devices where does it tell

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:07,199
you what it does it's not there now I

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,669
took a screenshot of what it is right

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,229
now and the UI is beautiful it looks

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,720
great right it's super clean it's easy

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:18,030
to look at that's all wonderful but the

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,919
user experience is a lot better because

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,520
now there's naming their product one

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,039
note they also have the ability to buy

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,139
up at the top and it called action

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,599
button you know that they either want

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,190
you to sign in first sign up and then

00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,550
they made this really cool graphic and

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:38,190
this graphic by itself tells you exactly

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,340
what problem they're solving for you the

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,990
consumer it shows that it's a notebook

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,639
because you can see all the handwriting

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,949
on it you can see that you can import

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,830
images into it and you can make

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,620
checklists and to do's so what one note

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,240
is officially done is basically take

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,460
their old site that they had and said

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,180
what problems are we solving for people

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:03,810
and how can we visualize that problem

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,090
being solved and as few words possible

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,430
and the only things that they have on

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,400
here is your digital notebook so

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,319
combined with your digital notebook very

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,610
easy call to action items that are

00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,120
colored appropriately and sized

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,620
appropriately with good imagery you can

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,289
look at the top of the screen without

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,440
even scrolling and know exactly what

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,969
OneNote does for you

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,259
now I'm picking on Microsoft a lot I

00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:29,940
don't know why it just happened to be

00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,569
that way I actually have nothing against

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,759
Microsoft so this is the current surface

00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:38,789
website I know what a surface is because

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm in development but the only place

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:42,120
that surface is notated is all the way

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,620
up there at the top and tiny letters now

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,590
I know Microsoft site I know where to

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,900
look but if I didn't Google this I would

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,870
have no idea what this is now one thing

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,360
I do like about this in terms of its

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,009
user experience is this right here

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,159
even though it's not pretty that UI

00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,509
isn't good you look at those links and

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,810
those links are pretty much or

00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,350
everything you'd want to

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,930
when thinking about buying a surface so

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,700
even though the UI on their new surface

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,230
site may not be the best and they may

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,710
not be using their words very well to

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:17,200
explain what it is their user experience

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,680
in knowing these are the five things I

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,610
want my customers to be able to do they

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,320
nailed that

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,520
now that should technically be a little

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,320
bit higher up on the page a little bit

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,400
bolder but we'll pass through that for

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,950
now so what other than how the site is

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,210
designed layout and structure they're

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,110
really the thing that we kind of keep

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:42,190
coming back to is the content that's on

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:44,380
the site and this is the most overlooked

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,800
part of the web design and development

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,420
process in my opinion I go and I build a

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,390
website for a company it will take a law

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,620
firm for example and they're like oh we

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,630
already have a website it's like 10

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,890
years old but we can just buy a new

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,040
template and throw the content in there

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,890
it's all good together that's adding to

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,080
that mediocre section of websites where

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,440
you're just copying and pasting content

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,660
without really thinking through how

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,640
you're solving problems for people and

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,890
so this is where we kind of walked

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,490
through the steps of how do we solve

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,680
this usability problem with words and

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,830
that's where you can unlock your unfair

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,200
advantage either for yourself or for

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,270
your customers so a couple questions we

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,990
want to go over here the first one being

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:35,890
is who who is your target customer now

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,970
we're gonna go and I'm actually good

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,050
we're gonna walk through these questions

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,210
again and I'm actually gonna put myself

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,100
in the spotlight but what do you want to

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,480
do here is let's say you're a marketing

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,700
person marketing there's a lot of stuff

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,250
that goes with marketing right you can't

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,020
be everybody's solution to every single

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,370
problem that they have so when you're

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,720
asking the question who do you serve

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,230
narrow that challenge to the one or two

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,990
things you do the best or your customer

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,510
does the best ask them to pick because

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,190
the people that are broad they typically

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,740
don't really know how they serve their

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,330
people well so the first one question is

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,440
who are you serving what are those

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:15,080
verticals and

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,000
they could be either verticals that

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,250
generate a lot of revenue right now and

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,530
that are good for business or these

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,150
verticals could be industries that you

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,690
quite haven't tapped into yet and that

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,070
you want to expand into so it's a mix of

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,230
both and you have to think and that's a

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,850
business decision you have to figure out

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,020
what are those one or two verticals that

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,050
you want to attack whether they're

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,660
current or whether they're new

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:42,710
once you define who you want to look at

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:47,720
each of those and say okay what problems

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:50,050
am i solving for is that vertical it's

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,910
not what services can I throw at them

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,740
because any website especially with web

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,810
development companies you scroll the top

00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,270
and it says we build websites and then

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,070
it says WordPress website hosting and

00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,770
design right and three little icons

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,230
right below it you want to figure out

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:09,620
why these people want these services why

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,680
does the end customer go to your website

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,620
what problem are they having that's what

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,440
you need to be able to answer and if you

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,210
can answer that question for them before

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,860
they even realize that they have it kind

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,960
of consciously then you're already

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,220
making that emotional connection with

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,950
them before they pick up the phone and

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,140
call you or submit a contact or or do

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,940
the live chat or whatever it is you're

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,130
already winning in their book because

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,450
you've shown them that you understand

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:42,950
where they're at the next piece of this

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:45,470
is how are you gonna guide them to their

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,730
solution don't just again the same thing

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,140
with their service just don't throw a

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,670
service at their face and say oh you

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,020
need web design oh you need web

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,080
development or whatever that happens to

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,740
be show them hey I know where you're at

00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,170
here and this is the path to go and get

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,490
this completed and kind of guide them

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,110
through it if anybody is familiar with

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,750
story brand by Donald Miller you're

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,350
gonna kind of hear some of the same

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,720
terminology that I'm kind of talking

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,210
through here but you guide them through

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,940
so that they can see what success what

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:17,930
that solution looks like and speaking of

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,920
a solution you have to know why your

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,920
projector just stops working

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,580
well did my laptop yeah

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:36,610
you can ride yeah exactly blue screen

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,470
let's see if that just works this is a

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,529
very example oriented presentation

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,079
because it really helps to see it rather

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:45,519
than me just talking words of you so and

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,600
there's a lot of examples that I'm

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,600
hoping that this Oh

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,649
maybe ah victory okay all right present

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:21,150
I got prison to know pretty is it

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:23,279
there we are okay okay awesome

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,800
we're still connected yes we are

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,550
connected awesome okay so sorry about

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,550
that guys so where was I at defining so

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,720
and showing what success so yeah

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,770
figuring out what that solution is and

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,640
then what do you want to do at that

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,950
point is show them what success looks

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,460
like so let's say you're a plumber and

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:47,070
you fix toilets for example you can put

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,140
on your services list we we serve

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,970
despoilers or you can put something

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,640
along the lines in a header at the top

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,740
don't let that overflowing toilet ruin

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,570
your next Super Bowl party you make that

00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,850
emotional connection right it's like oh

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:03,060
crap I definitely don't want that to

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,089
happen when there's 30 people in my

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,950
house and now I have to deal with that

00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:10,980
or somebody goes to your site and says

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,350
oh they do fun what's more engaging what

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,440
pulls you in more and so you have to

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,300
show them what success looks like you

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,150
can't just say you will be successful

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:25,230
but on the flip side of success is

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:26,790
failure and so with failure you have to

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,990
show them what that also looks like as

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,910
well now you don't want to drive the

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,170
point home so far to where you're the

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,459
Negative Nancy here right

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,620
nobody likes working with those kind of

00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,709
but again come up with that overflowing

00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:41,160
toilet problem you show them both of

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:43,410
those versions in that one sentence if

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,270
they don't utilize you they're gonna

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,550
have that overflowing toilet in the

00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,029
middle of their 30-foot party so that's

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,830
what failure looks like but then success

00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:56,910
looks like oh we're okay we don't have

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:58,500
to worry about that so in order to show

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,540
them a success you need to also be able

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,910
to mention what it looks like if they

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:07,800
don't work with you as well

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:09,839
so actually in the middle of doing this

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,920
for my own business now you go to my

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,390
site right now you're gonna be like

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,830
Chris you're lying fool you don't do

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,770
this on your site I know I'm doing it

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,459
now I promise so what I want to do is I

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,820
want to look a little bit

00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:22,769
introspectively here so about a year or

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,319
so ago I looked at my business and again

00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:27,300
doing this for 15 years and the way that

00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:28,739
I run my business is when I find

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,480
somebody that's good at content writing

00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:31,949
I kind of pulled them in when I find a

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,559
good photographer I kind of pull them in

00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:37,319
and what I've done in the past was I've

00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,850
updated my website to shoe this and what

00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:44,549
happened was when I looked at my website

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:47,699
last year I saw this this was my

00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:50,610
services list on my website what do I do

00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:52,589
the best out of that list nobody had any

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,059
idea that I might get some calls about

00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:57,989
oh yeah you're a one-stop shop for

00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:59,759
everything but yes that's true but it

00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:01,350
doesn't give me the clients that I was

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,059
interested in working with which was web

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,860
development they're the people that

00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,720
mom-and-pop shops that just wanted and

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,779
bruising under one roof and really

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,709
didn't pay for it that much so we're in

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,509
the process of stripping that down to

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:19,079
where we only do web development and

00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:20,369
break and that's all now don't get me

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,720
wrong if somebody comes to me and says

00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:23,100
hey Chris do you can you do the

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,899
photography for us as well

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,689
sure of course you can still do these

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:30,360
things but you don't want to overload

00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:34,649
your potential customers with a wall of

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,629
services that was my problem so now that

00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:38,069
I figured that out I'm gonna go ahead

00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,899
and start walking down these lines but

00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:43,309
who do we serve so for me what that

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:45,629
example looks like it's twofold we serve

00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:47,970
mom-and-pop shops with web development

00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:50,759
that has smaller budgets and we work

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,619
with a lot of agencies because those

00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,170
agencies don't have WordPress they might

00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:57,269
do other things and so I want to use my

00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:01,319
services and my team that I have to help

00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:03,929
them expand their growth model so then

00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,389
what's next we have to define what those

00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:08,130
problems are for those two verticals so

00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:11,459
the mom-and-pop shops when I hear all

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,500
the time is I'm locked out of my sight I

00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,760
cannot get into my site I don't know how

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,910
to edit it I wasn't

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,770
on it or I can do all that but I don't

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,179
have a copy of it so I don't know how to

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,160
get access to it and move it away from

00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:26,120
my current developer all these horror

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,290
stories for the agency side of things

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,210
what problems were trying to solve for

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,559
then is really just growth they're

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,320
interested in building a partnership

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,840
with somebody that has skills that they

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,880
don't have so they can focus on what

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,549
they do best

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,730
it allows us to focus on what we do

00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:46,650
things so no to the problem sets for the

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,570
two industry clients that we're pushing

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,650
out and some of the other I'd say that

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,150
there's still a little bit too broad

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,080
they are but they were a lot more

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,610
problem than this so now these are

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,010
talking about the solutions that we're

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,799
gonna provide them so with non-pom shops

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,900
what did I have figured out when I do my

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,179
pitch to smaller companies have smaller

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,980
budgets I told them hey when we're done

00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,690
with your site we're gonna shoot you

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,669
five to seven educational training

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,820
videos are going to be hosted on a

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:17,280
private YouTube playlist on your website

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,410
so that you know how to edit get a 90

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,600
percent of your website and you can

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,160
access them whenever you want they're

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,660
all yours if you want me to stick them

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,049
up and email them to you I can do that

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,520
too when the site's done do the same

00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,200
thing we'll take all the files of

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,690
everything we'll zip it up just in case

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,100
anything goes wrong you have a copy of

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,950
your site obviously I hope that never

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,330
happens but I want to be on the safe

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,760
side because I respect you as a business

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:45,090
owner and I don't want you to ever be

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,040
stuck in that terrible on the flip side

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,450
for agencies again it's all about grip

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,890
they want to have a partner that they

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:55,200
can rely on that does what we do best so

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,360
they can focus on all their other stuff

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,040
and growing their business and if we're

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,850
not allowing them to grow their business

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,620
then we're not doing our job so that's

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,900
how we that's how we provide this

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:11,570
solution and then what does success look

00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,570
like for a moment yes

00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:17,429
unloose is right weird I think I said

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,550
private which were private house or

00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:22,170
unlisted no no no no no you're good no

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,460
yet there's not these 200 training

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,170
videos of random people sites that are

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,510
searchable on youtube so you mercy yeah

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,070
no I have actual had a couple of

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,480
questions about that can anybody access

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:34,110
these I'm like we'll pay them to 20

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,240
digit ID yeah it's not gonna happen

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,660
so yes they're all private ones or

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,160
unlisted thing so with success so we

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,710
have to define what success looks like

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,450
for these two verticals and for

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,130
mom-and-pop shops who really just want

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,420
to build their website once and be done

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,610
with it and they probably don't really

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,390
do much editing on it they just want to

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,550
be easy

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,990
that's all they don't want to have to

00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,309
lift a finger this one to get done

00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,170
because they're spending a good portion

00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,970
of their savings account on this site

00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,990
and they don't want to they don't want

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,500
to worry with it they don't want to beat

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:06,990
the other ones they don't have any

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,840
problems with this and then for the

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,670
other side of the agencies they want to

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,010
have more business growth opportunities

00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,750
they want to be opened up to be able to

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,600
expand their business and multiple lands

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:21,750
so that's kind of how we've walked

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,809
through kind of our business and going

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:27,570
forward with this and so what I'm going

00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:30,300
to do here is I have about kind of ten

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,520
examples of things so based off of the

00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,070
four questions that we've already kind

00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,840
of gone over I want to take a look at

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,630
some sites that people that do that

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,240
answer these questions well and also

00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,950
dumb because I feel like looking

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,170
some visuals kind of help to drive home

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:51,090
some of these points up and preaching at

00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:54,750
you about so important now go there's

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:56,100
some place in the back so if y'all from

00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,420
Georgia chances are you probably heard

00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,010
this guy and they get contending with

00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,780
the other ones I don't know any of these

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,510
people I pulled off sites that I just

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,870
heard on radio ads TV ads except I'm so

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,700
this lawyer figured out that the main

00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,100
problem he was solving for these

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,640
personal injury clients what they always

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:17,670
got a runaround with lawyers and so his

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,530
thought was hey if we can figure out a

00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,990
way the first time they get a call they

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:25,290
get to talk with somebody that help them

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,240
out that's gonna be a win so that's the

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,590
problem that they're solving for them

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,290
now what does it you that or not I have

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:34,500
no idea but their slogan and I've heard

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:37,620
it TV and radio for the last decade one

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,030
call that's all and because of that you

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,520
know exactly what you're going to get

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,530
and so you should hopefully be able to

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,210
call the one number and not have to

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,809
worry about anything else you shouldn't

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:52,100
be given the runner by this guy over

00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:54,690
here we have Microsoft onedrive which

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:59,850
does a really good job at the very top I

00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:01,220
think I've highlighted in that first

00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:06,330
sentence at the very top of the page

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:09,450
files photos any device anywhere see

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:12,720
plans sign up just those four little

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:15,120
phrases I know exactly what this does no

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,800
questions asked this is why content is

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,800
important this is why I'm figuring out

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,230
what problems you saw for people is

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,650
important because now instead of using a

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:28,140
wall of paragraph text you use one

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,710
sentence and two buttons that takes no

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,650
visual space on your site

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:35,140
and now people can know exactly what you

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,760
do without really having to think too

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,810
hard you don't want people to think too

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,040
hard when they're on your site this is a

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:45,700
t-shirt coming down the floor tonight

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:49,150
scroll down and it's a little bit too

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,810
long but the thing is big bold what we

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,070
do and then there's four simple bullets

00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:56,380
you read those bullet points and you

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,300
only understand exactly how they serve

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,030
you that's whether you use their design

00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,490
whether you upload your own and how easy

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:06,040
it is you also have this guy down here

00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:09,490
which is kind of hard to read but it

00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,620
uses very much millennial jargon in it

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,000
and so that strikes a chord with you

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,410
you're gonna feel that emotional

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,270
connection so you're gonna read these

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,040
four things be like okay that's easy and

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,110
then you're gonna see this guy who looks

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,470
like a hippie tryn ster over here saying

00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,000
sup fam and you're gonna feel the head

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,070
you're gonna feel that emotional

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,560
connection with this brand even before

00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,940
you click on that guy to go talk to him

00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,500
I actually chatted with them and they

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,470
sent me a free shirt within five minutes

00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,760
it was great so if you're gonna do

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,960
something like this that's actually one

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,050
other thing if you're gonna do something

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,540
like a live chat or whatnot

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,160
unless it's if it's automated but make

00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,170
sure it's programmed well so it kind of

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,210
feels like you're talking to a real

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,910
person if you're gonna have the option

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,950
to do live shot make sure you have

00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:58,720
somebody there I chatted with this guy

00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:00,580
at 9:00 p.m. after hours and we chatted

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,520
for about 15 minutes about t-shirt stuff

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,720
so if you're gonna do things make sure

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,680
you do them well and don't do it halfway

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,910
this is a t-shirt coming this is

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,880
actually the only company that I do now

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,560
so that is the one disclaimer but they

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,620
provide they do a lot of outdoor wear

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,810
shirts and they don't use a lot of words

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,130
but the thing is if you look at their

00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,990
menu bar you have an idea that their

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,370
clothing company they have a big white

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,650
call-to-action in the bottom left-hand

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,050
corner of visit the shop and right smack

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,390
in the middle is their t-shirt on a guy

00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,560
throwing a rock and then they also have

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,140
a slider down here at the bottom as well

00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,090
to show showcase some other things I'm

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,020
not too big of a fan of sliders that's

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,860
another topic for another day but

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,810
without even using words

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,370
you can still get away with trying to uh

00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,610
not trying but you can still get away

00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:51,290
with showcasing what you do for people

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,940
even with you know really just one

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,190
call-to-action button and some links at

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,740
the top but they know their brand their

00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,200
brand is very visual and so they had to

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,460
put that on the forefront and it doesn't

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,810
look like all of their clothing sites a

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,340
lot of clothing sites have just tiles

00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,410
think Amazon right you have all these

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,690
tiles across the page you pick which one

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,550
they decided you know they're gonna go

00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,350
kind of swing for the fences and either

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,570
hit a home run or strikeout and so they

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,800
put their one product here in hope so

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,280
that will help trigger conversions and

00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:21,560
it's been working so far Netflix this is

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,150
really i netflix actually toggles their

00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,260
home pages my wife and i were looking at

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,980
this she was helping me collect some

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:30,050
screenshots I got this one and my wife

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,760
got a different one and so they were

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,230
doing some what's called a bee testing

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,460
again that's another interesting topic

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,220
if you're interested in learning about

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,550
conversions do some googling on a bee

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,800
testing but what I thought was really

00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,600
interesting about this is whenever

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,670
people try to force me to give them a

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,410
credit card before I can do the free

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,700
trial I'm like shoot they're gonna wait

00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,780
three days we're gonna charge my credit

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,050
card they're not even gonna remind me

00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,430
well here they visually show that

00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,040
they're gonna email you a three day

00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:00,050
reminder to cancel so they're gonna

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,810
remind you to cancel three days ahead of

00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,010
time and if they didn't show that I

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,990
would have no idea that they're gonna

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,600
remind me ahead of time but they took

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,250
the extra step and they figured out that

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,840
the problem that a lot of people have

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,150
about signing up for free when the

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,190
Jakarta card involved is getting a

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,620
reminder email and making sure that they

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,830
can cancel so now they've kind of

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,090
visually shown me oh you care you don't

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,680
want to kind of you know get me caught

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,830
in a bad situation where I have to ask

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,420
for a refund and I don't want to do that

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,490
now they've solved that problem and they

00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,440
give you exact dates as well so those

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,920
dates were dynamic relative to the date

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,570
that I pulled that up so again how to

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,100
figure out how you solve those problems

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,840
whether it's in words whether it's

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,170
visual whether it's a combination of

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,930
both it's about solving those problems

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:52,070
before the user even thinks about that

00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:53,510
as a problem the athletic this is a one

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,190
of the not one of the first I shouldn't

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,380
say that but it's a sports journalism

00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,470
site

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,059
is pay to read and so this is one of the

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,799
first legitimate ones of that I'm a big

00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,130
sports fan and this is the first one of

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,900
the most legit ones I found that is

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,340
relatively cheap it's pitted and that is

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,280
actually being say that's actually

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,809
successful and so right there they

00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,730
figured out that you know there's going

00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:19,059
to be this big curve of them trying to

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,620
get people to subscribe to stuff that

00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:23,320
they could get very readily available on

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:26,140
ESPN Sports Illustrated bleacher report

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,210
etc whatever those other ones are and so

00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,130
they've called themselves the new

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,530
standard of sports journalism so they're

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:35,559
already setting the bar of expectation

00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,000
for people and then immediately they

00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,710
have their two call-to-action button

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,770
start your free trial logging in at the

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:44,799
top and so again very minimally word

00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,919
usage here you're seeing a trend and

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,299
these sites that are doing it well

00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,860
they're not using a lot of words are not

00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,360
using paragraphs of text they're

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,600
figuring out the problem they want to

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,890
solve and they're showcasing that if

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,750
they didn't say that they're the new

00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,640
standard sports journalism then other

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,049
people might be thinking okay this is

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,740
just like all the other free sites out

00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:09,039
there right next one

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:12,220
I love sticker meal site sticker meal is

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,860
the best at stickers and I mean just

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,500
look oh I don't I thought I put boxes on

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,780
all these sorry that top left-hand

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,210
corner literally everything you need to

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,280
know about sticker meal is in two

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,990
sentences and two buttons because I know

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,480
me when I first when I first bought from

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,950
them I wanted to know how to get samples

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,789
big button SHOP NOW

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,929
big button custom stickers that kick ass

00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:36,220
obviously you know exactly what kind of

00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,500
quality they're gonna give you and of

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:42,190
course it goes dead again

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,780
but again two sentences right two

00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,549
sentences two buttons and then the

00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,400
imagery that was all there it showed the

00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:50,559
die cut stickers which at the time that

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,350
they started not many people not many

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,809
companies did that they gave you the

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,640
circle stickers on a roll they I believe

00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:00,730
they were one of the first legitimate

00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,740
companies that actually provided custom

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:06,100
die cut stickers at a relatively

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,870
reasonable price and so again they

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,160
showcase that on their site with the

00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:13,480
imagery that they used

00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:16,630
the two sentences and the two buttons so

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,360
let me see here if this will work for me

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:25,360
I just need five more minutes let's see

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:27,900
if this will work hop over there there

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,900
we go okay

00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:35,190
so this one this is one that did it that

00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,840
is the opposite so tell me now I will

00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,300
say the background video the background

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,760
is a video I took a screen capture of

00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,340
the worst possible still I could

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:50,550
purposefully does anybody have any idea

00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:54,480
who this is nope exactly this is a place

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:56,640
called TopGolf does anybody does see

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,140
exactly it's very small but what is

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,400
TopGolf I know what topped off is

00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,480
because I turned by it ten thousand

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,980
times but looking at this it's a guitar

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,780
right yeah that's a guitar exactly they

00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,950
have a video of like live music and

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,640
stuff all the fun stuff that they're

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:13,590
doing but this site tells me nothing

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,780
about what you what they're about what

00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,690
you can do going there they use a

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,900
minimal amount of words which is great

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,610
but there's nothing here that says you

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,860
can golf with your friends with very

00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,360
unique games and cool different whole

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,710
layouts and all the stuff that they do

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,010
I've never been so I don't really know

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:34,020
exactly how to explain it but this is a

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,929
good example of a great design I mean

00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,490
it's beautiful to look at but and the UX

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:40,440
that's very easy to figure out where you

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,780
want where they want you to go the

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,910
buttons are clear reserved all the menu

00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,040
items on the left they called actions in

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,750
the middle but this is where they're not

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,390
showcasing that competitive advantage

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,280
that unfair advantage that they have

00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:55,860
which is they're very unique twist of

00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,950
how you go and do a golf outing with

00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:02,429
friends who've never played golf before

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:04,500
so this was one that was just it looked

00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:06,390
beautiful but again it comes down to the

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,240
words it comes down to how you serve

00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:16,740
your customers and they're not

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:19,530
showcasing that here yes exactly yes or

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,630
even there they're they're not they're

00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:25,350
store layout but they're golf course is

00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,730
very picturesque and if you combine even

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,370
just somebody kind of on the back swing

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:33,059
a golf with their course just that by

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,880
itself at least it shows that okay we're

00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:37,680
gonna be golfing but it's not golf it's

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,480
different

00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Yeah right exactly their shows in it

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,690
just shows that it's fun right yeah

00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,940
exactly but the majority of this video

00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,520
was the social aspect of it it was just

00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,200
people drinking and people playing music

00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,250
it wasn't really about the golf and so I

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,280
picked the worst screenshot I could

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,840
possibly find of it to showcase that so

00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,610
really what I want to do now we have

00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,960
about five minutes because I want to

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,090
make sure you get out of here on time

00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,920
it's anybody have any questions about

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:09,030
any of this stuff that we've talked

00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:11,250
about so far yes yeah so there's a book

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:14,460
by a guy named Donald Miller it's called

00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:17,130
story brand and the path that I walk go

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,820
through was not story brand exactly but

00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:24,320
it was very close so story Brandt is a

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,320
fantastic book I highly recommend it

00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:30,050
anybody else yes

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,630
exactly yeah I honestly I think almost

00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:45,130
the tagline is more important than

00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,510
either the logo or the brand name

00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,680
because honestly look at all the

00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,650
companies you see that have stuck around

00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,170
for 20-30 years and they have ugly logos

00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,910
but their tagline if that explains

00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:00,870
exactly how you solve problems for

00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:00,870
people you win yes

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,450
so you really in case anybody in here

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,700
how do you choose hero images for

00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,700
website so something like this how can

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,800
you not make that happen and really my

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,670
two cents on that is if you can again

00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,260
kind of go back to what we talked about

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,780
before defining the problem that you're

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:33,330
solving and so in case for tie in top

00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,910
gulfs case they're solving a way to make

00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:39,300
golf fun again for a younger generation

00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:41,220
and so being able to showcase golf fun

00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,980
and their unique atmosphere in a single

00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,080
image if possible that would be the win

00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,580
now with consulting company this thing

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,070
like that things like what I do it's a

00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,920
little bit harder to get that feeling

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,540
from a photo and so for things that are

00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,080
little bit more intangible I always

00:33:54,540 --> 00:34:00,660
recommend going with real photos of

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,240
yourself your team your actual customers

00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,680
because there is a difference even if

00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,970
you take your photos professionally just

00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,330
like stock photos are taken as well

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:11,340
there's a huge difference of oh that's

00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,870
the guy that I met with or I saw that

00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,330
guy on LinkedIn or Facebook or Twitter

00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:17,280
you know that it's real and you start

00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,530
making that kind of behind-the-scenes in

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,600
your brain connection with those people

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,070
so it's really figuring out that problem

00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,560
that you're solving and if you can

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:28,290
capture that in a photo or drawing or

00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,940
whatever your style is that's what that

00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,860
hero image is and that's part of the

00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,470
reason I don't like rotating banners is

00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:37,500
you should have your one image that one

00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,179
thing that defines you and let that

00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,649
stick because the second one is not

00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,909
going to be as good it's not going to be

00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:43,909
as pointed yes you were first

00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:04,530
yeah for the most part I wouldn't say

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,120
micro size but it's more about people

00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,610
even if even if you do business to

00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,810
business transactions like I do I'm

00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,340
still the person at least with my

00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,540
business I'm on the front line saying hi

00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,420
my name is Chris I want to do business

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,320
with you right and you're my customer

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,550
you don't really care what my business

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,840
name is right you want to make a

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,060
connection with me it's this human to

00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,610
human connection so it's not really as

00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,020
much about the logo it's more about can

00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:28,410
you make that connection and can you

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:30,000
bridge that gap so it's a hard way it's

00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:35,490
it's hard to win that fight with

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,470
customers I totally understand it yeah

00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:42,000
there you go yeah exactly exactly I

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:50,640
think you had your hand at first

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:52,140
I haven't done as much a lot of the

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,800
screen recording systems like lucky

00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,330
orange and hot char they build it in to

00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,550
their platform so that you can make

00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:01,380
those changes on the platform and

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,390
actually not edit your website so I

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,100
would look into those I was just Google

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:08,130
a bee testing but I know hot jar is one

00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,660
of the biggest ones out there I don't

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,460
have as much experience with it some

00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,400
other people might but that's what I

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:20,120
would probably look into first hot jar

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,120
h.o.t jay-ar over here yes

00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,660
and that is a very interesting question

00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:54,210
that's where you really need to kind of

00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,490
take a dive into of how the business is

00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,500
structured because you can't just on the

00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,869
homepage blast them with five different

00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,060
things right you have to figure out how

00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:04,619
what is most important what is second

00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,780
what's third was fourth what's fifth and

00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,570
that's a business development question

00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,800
and then based on what the answers to

00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,810
those questions are from the business

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,520
development standpoint you figure out

00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,810
what problems those each of those lines

00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,880
solve and obviously each of them have

00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,080
landing pages right and you kind of

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,480
figure out how do you solve those

00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,859
problems within those landing pages but

00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,330
your question is more how do you kind of

00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,160
create that home page structure and

00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:28,050
that's really kind of on a case-by-case

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,330
basis you have to figure out from the

00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,100
business what is important because you

00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,119
really can only showcase one or two

00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,850
things at a time you don't have

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,310
unlimited real estate above the fold so

00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,260
it's more of a case-by-case basis on

00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,250
that one so so I know that's not really

00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,350
the answer you probably wanted to hear

00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,600
but that's that's a that's a difficult

00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,450
one unless you know knowing the business

00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,300
objectives so all right so we have two

00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,830
minutes before 10:00 10:50 does anybody

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:59,960
else have any questions before we wrap

00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:59,960
up yes all you mean on the home page

00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:06,319
I wouldn't necessarily say it's there's

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,299
a limit now you do need to be careful of

00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:10,400
page side low times all that kind of fun

00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,780
stuff but for example the t-shirt

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,240
company that's gonna be a lot more image

00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,849
heavy right then my company is marketing

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,670
website for consulting services so you

00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:21,770
really have to balance what needs images

00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,910
in order to sell and so for a t-shirt

00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,410
company you're gonna have a lot of

00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,440
images that's what's going to be the

00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,089
case but if you're somebody like me you

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,440
want to show that human interaction it's

00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,789
gonna be a lot less you have to use a

00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,069
little more words to kind of balance

00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:35,089
things out but with t-shirts throw

00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:38,390
images on the screen with a Buy Now

00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:39,559
button make it simple so yes and I'm

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,030
gonna go probably over to the happiness

00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,380
bar after this so if anybody else has

00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:46,910
questions afterwards I'm gonna go across

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:49,069
over there oh yeah go ahead I actually

00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,700
have a link at the end of my

00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:52,309
presentation

00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:59,539
it's um let me actually pull it up

00:38:52,309 --> 00:39:02,420
really quick come on oh there's crap

00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:10,279
there we go classic not classic but CLS

00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:12,970
C dot city /wc atl and that'll take you

00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:12,970
right to the google slides

00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,339
well I hope y'all got some stuff out of

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:21,660
this I hope it was good for y'all I am

00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:23,430
gonna go over to the happiness bar for a

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,630
little while so if you have any other
