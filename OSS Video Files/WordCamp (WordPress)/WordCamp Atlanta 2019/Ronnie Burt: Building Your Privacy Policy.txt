Title: Ronnie Burt: Building Your Privacy Policy
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	Recent laws (with more on the way!) make it a requirement that even the most basic of sites and blogs have a Privacy Policy and follow best privacy practices. And working with a law firm or consultant can prove to be costly and overwhelming. Luckily, recent WordPress updates have done much of the hard work for us, but we still need to spend the time to document our practices and policies, which isn’t always a straightforward task. We’ll discuss the requirements of a Privacy Policy, how to use the new built-in WordPress privacy tools, and provide open-sourced examples that you can take and make your own. You will walk out of this session with everything you need to publish or update your privacy policy with confidence.
