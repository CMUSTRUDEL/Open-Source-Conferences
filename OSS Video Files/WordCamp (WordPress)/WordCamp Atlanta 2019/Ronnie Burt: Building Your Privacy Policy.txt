Title: Ronnie Burt: Building Your Privacy Policy
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	Recent laws (with more on the way!) make it a requirement that even the most basic of sites and blogs have a Privacy Policy and follow best privacy practices. And working with a law firm or consultant can prove to be costly and overwhelming. Luckily, recent WordPress updates have done much of the hard work for us, but we still need to spend the time to document our practices and policies, which isn’t always a straightforward task. We’ll discuss the requirements of a Privacy Policy, how to use the new built-in WordPress privacy tools, and provide open-sourced examples that you can take and make your own. You will walk out of this session with everything you need to publish or update your privacy policy with confidence.

all right good morning thanks for for

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,040
joining us in this interesting boardroom

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,800
setup I was saying it feels like a jury

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,929
of my peers or a Senate hearing or

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,389
something like that but it's kind of I

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,060
guess makes sense since we're talking

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,980
about sort of a heavy topic privacy

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,570
there's some legal implications there

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,939
and everything like that so we'll just

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,289
get started thanks again for for being

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:32,790
here and of course that's when the

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,290
clicker stops how many of you saw me do

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:43,829
this like six times before we got

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:46,050
started and it worked well just go the

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,750
old-fashioned way so a little bit about

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,629
me I've been working with wordpress for

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,059
more than 10 years I started kind of

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,100
just doing freelance WordPress II stuff

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,980
on my own not really that great of a

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,809
developer so that's why that didn't last

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,989
before and kind of while I was getting

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,010
started in WordPress I was a middle

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,340
school and high school math teacher

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,290
taught algebra through calculus and so

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,119
totally not related at all to what to

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,130
what we're doing but it does mean that

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,990
I'm very used to being interrupted or

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,759
getting distracted by the folks that I'm

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,439
talking to so I'll be a little offended

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,240
actually if you don't raise your hand

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,970
throw questions out as we go I'm

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,850
definitely used to that I work for a

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,170
company called Inc sub Inc sub is the

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,229
parent company of three different

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,079
services WP mu dev campus press and edgy

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,689
blogs and a little more than a year ago

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,720
I had I guess you could say the good

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,340
fortune of drawing the short straw to

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,560
have to figure out how our company was

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,659
gonna deal with this whole GD PR thing

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,130
that everyone was talking about so

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,070
before that I didn't really know much

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,259
about it no one really in our company to

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,299
be honest really knew a lot about it but

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,130
we knew it was important we kept hearing

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,630
about it from our customers you know we

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,380
knew that we really had to tackle this

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,340
and tackle it well so I sat out on quite

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,890
a few months just reading watching

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,869
videos on WordPress TV and elsewhere and

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,760
just seeing what I could figure out

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,890
about what it is that we needed to do to

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,530
make sure that we were doing the

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,970
thing and basically the result of all

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,090
that is kind of what we'll be talking

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:23,690
about today I want to show you that it

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,280
doesn't take really going and paying

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,540
someone a lot of money to do it for you

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,250
there's a lot of tools and a lot of

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,530
things available in a pretty reasonable

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:34,300
amount of time that you could go through

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,300
and and kind of do these things yourself

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,700
so this tuck you know who's it for

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,400
really it's for anyone that has a

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,830
website if you have a website you are

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,220
legally obligated if your website

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,690
collects any sort of personal data we'll

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,850
talk about what that means in just a

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,440
second but if your website collects

00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,840
anything that could be construed as

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,670
personal data in most places you're

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,010
legally obligated to have a privacy

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,380
policy on your website and it needs to

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,630
have the word privacy somewhere in the

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,780
footer or somewhere on your site that's

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,640
easily found so basically I am assuming

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,470
since you're at WordCamp that probably

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,489
means that it's pretty relevant to all

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,510
of us and that's probably why you're

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:19,820
here

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,320
so we can keep going in on that so as we

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,209
kind of mentioned I tweeted out these

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,519
slides it should be my top the tweet

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,220
right now twitter.com slash Ronnie Burt

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,010
my website is also Ronnie Burt calm and

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,720
it will be after this is over at the top

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,209
of my presentations link that's there

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,190
too if Twitter isn't isn't your thing or

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:42,890
you're not seeing it there I've also

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,739
created a little two-page Google Doc

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,790
checklist that basically summarizes

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,340
everything that we're going to talk

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,470
about in in order kind of as we're going

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,030
to talk about it that is free for you to

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,950
just access rip apart use as needed just

00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,450
to kind of as be a guide if you want to

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,180
go through a similar process to what I

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,840
went through or that we described

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,310
instead of having to go through the

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,650
slides this checklist is probably a

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,359
little bit better tool for for you to

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:13,549
use so that is that bit ly / WP privacy

00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,290
and that's that will be there and you

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,890
can leave comments on it questions

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:22,400
things like that as well

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:24,950
and I'd be remiss to talk about probably

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,450
the most exciting development in the

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,670
last year or two and

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,920
definitely as a result of the whole gdpr

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:34,760
thing that we were talking about there

00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,490
are some excellent tools and settings in

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,470
WordPress itself related to privacy I

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,570
would argue that most people just don't

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,340
know they're there and even if you do

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,470
know that they're there they can be a

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,610
little bit weird to kind of navigate so

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,500
I'm going to show you that a little bit

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,470
too and it's gonna make your lives a lot

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,700
easier and so if you look under settings

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,250
privacy in your WordPress dashboard

00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,430
that's where it's all found so that was

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,050
introduced right around a year ago and

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,140
four point nine point six or something

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,580
like that those tools and I think

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,950
they're actually being improved at least

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,780
the from my understanding the way that

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,790
you can display privacy pages and

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,990
interact with themes and things like

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,580
that is being improved in the next

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,720
version of 5.22 so that's pretty

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,720
exciting which is coming out here

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,290
shortly so there's definitely an active

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,260
team of great people working on this and

00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:30,080
helping us all achieve this goal that

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:31,450
that we need to so one thing that we

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,010
want to talk about is this word

00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,770
compliance because it's something that

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,960
in my daily work I get asked all the

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,150
time you know are you compliant with

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,030
this are you compliant with that can you

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,550
prove that you have this and really

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,950
compliance is this word that is

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,100
misunderstood or misconstrued or misused

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:55,490
often compliance is about a snapshot a

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,870
single point in time and it doesn't mean

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:01,580
anything beyond that so I can almost

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,200
like prove compliance at a single point

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,310
in time like we can't there's ways of

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,730
getting around some of these things

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,510
really compliance isn't what should

00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,520
compliance is not which should be most

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,260
important to you a full well-rounded

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,880
practice from beginning to end and

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,470
ongoing is really what you should be

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,380
after and what you should be looking for

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,300
so this is kind of parsing words and you

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,070
know we can debate philosophically on

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,170
this but it's it's something that a lot

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,480
of folks feel strongly about

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,030
so here the myth up here you can use a

00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,680
plug-in for compliance there are a

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,690
decent amounts of plugins there a decent

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,430
amount of websites out there especially

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,620
when the whole gdpr craze came through

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,870
that would say you know we'll promise to

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,370
make you compliant just you know sign up

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,530
for this and do that

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,560
no one can do that for you they're still

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,090
going to be work involved for you and in

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,810
actions that you're gonna have to take

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,560
in order to make that work and so I just

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,070
don't want to give you any false

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,720
promises or feeling that someone can do

00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,070
this for you or a plug-in or anything

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,060
like that there's still a lot of work

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,670
that you're gonna have to do and you're

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,930
here so you care I'm assuming or you

00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,750
just couldn't find anything else to sit

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,210
in but why should you care well here in

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,100
Georgia I I looked up I'm not from here

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:17,270
I'm from Austin Texas but I looked up I

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,590
think in 2007 the G pipa Act I'm not

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,120
sure if that's how the acronym is ever

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,130
said or if anybody from Georgia has ever

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,700
heard of it but the Georgia personal

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,680
identification Act is in place here so

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,880
if you're a resident here it's something

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,670
you might want to look into the way I

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,050
was reading about it it one thing that

00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,050
it does is it helps us define what

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,820
personal information is and in the law

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,420
personal information that needs to be

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,120
protected in that if it's if you feel

00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,530
like someone has access to that personal

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,960
information that shouldn't have you have

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,550
to disclose it to those people it comes

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,920
into place whenever it's someone's name

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,730
full name or first initial and last name

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,080
along with some other personalized

00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,270
personal information so if you have two

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,400
things together that's what this 2007

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,210
law says then you are legally obligated

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,550
to disclose or get in contact with

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,770
whoever's data you might have if that

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,630
happens we've all heard about the gdpr

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,030
the general data protection regulation

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,370
in the EU we heard about it because we

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:19,190
got like 700 privacy policy update

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,590
notification emails last May almost a

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,290
year around a year ago and that's

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,630
definitely still in force similarly

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,150
something that you're all going to start

00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,370
getting flood of emails in your inbox

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,250
about in the next few months is the new

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,070
California consumer Privacy Act excuse

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,160
me we've been getting over a cold and

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,630
all this coffin it's it's fun

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,690
the California consumer Privacy Act goes

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,060
in effect I think on January 1st 2020 so

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,910
it's right around the corner and it

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,320
means that Oh a lot of big companies

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,820
they're gonna have to update all their

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,649
privacy policies again and you're gonna

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,699
get

00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,800
these same emails and notifications

00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:58,930
please read these updated privacy

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,410
policies and things like that so for

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:05,559
most of us their California act is not

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,209
gonna directly be something that we have

00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,470
to show compliance for even though I

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,559
said we can't do that or we shouldn't

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,660
necessarily do that because it talks

00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,759
about a certain amount of money that you

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,589
earn in revenue when it's in the

00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,569
millions of dollars from residents of

00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:20,889
California or certain number of

00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:22,300
residents in California I think it's

00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,160
like 50 thousand or something so for

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:30,429
most of us we probably won't reach that

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:33,009
threshold there is often talks about a

00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:35,290
US federal policy related to all this

00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,879
stuff - and it comes and goes in the

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,600
news I'm not really sure where we are

00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,610
with that now but it definitely recently

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,379
was talked about again so all this to

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,869
say we're just gonna have to it's

00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:47,769
constantly changing constantly updating

00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:55,240
and it's something we have to stay on

00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:58,929
top of it's a little fun to think about

00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,579
the differences between the US and the

00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,740
rest of the world when it comes to

00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:05,709
privacy and it comes to litigation and

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,999
it comes to laws in general and the way

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:10,029
that it's kind of been explained to me

00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:11,620
which I think I agree with is that I

00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:15,189
don't know if you know this but in the

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:18,730
u.s. we're pretty lawsuit happy things

00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:21,999
tend to be settled in the civil courts

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:24,790
through through lawsuits basically in

00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:26,939
the EU and in most of the world much of

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,290
the world it's more regulation and

00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:31,629
government slapping fines on you or

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,279
something like that and so that is

00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,899
actually a pretty big difference so

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,569
you'll find in the gdpr it's very

00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:39,129
descriptive and very prescriptive tells

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:41,110
you exactly what you have to do and if

00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:43,600
you don't do it this is what is gonna

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,370
happen to you here in the US it's vague

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,189
and it's all settled in case law and

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,509
it's we have to just wait to see you

00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,799
know who gets sued about it and what the

00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,480
courts say from that and then we have to

00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,189
determine what we do that's just the

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,410
system's that we live in and it kind of

00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:59,079
frames the conversation and the

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,329
protections that we have to take and

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:05,049
that's very much related to this

00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:06,450
philosophy here a risk-based approach so

00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:09,329
what this means is

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:12,120
the practices that you need to take for

00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:15,149
a you know your individual personal blog

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,500
or your small ecommerce shop is gonna be

00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:19,139
way different than the practices that

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Facebook needs to be held liable for or

00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:22,980
you know help help to the standards that

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,709
they need to do that's it's a risk based

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,930
approach what is the worst that could

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:31,709
happen if you have the worst data breach

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:33,899
possible that needs to frame you know

00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:36,180
how much work you put into this so I say

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,730
this because the rest of the stuff I

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,329
have to say is pretty overwhelming it's

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:45,529
pretty detailed and I and I want you to

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:48,510
think that you know always go back to

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:49,920
well yes this is important but maybe it

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,660
doesn't apply directly to me right now

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,190
or I can I can get away with with one

00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,839
backup here when someone else needs to

00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,269
get asking needs to have two or three

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,310
redundant backups over there it's just

00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:05,720
there's no hardens and fast rules to

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,720
this but it's definitely a risk based

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:15,269
and the last sort of philosophical thing

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:19,920
I'll get through is privacy by design so

00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:21,660
this in the 90s in Canada government

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,199
agencies were working through their

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,240
privacy laws and came up with this

00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,970
construct that privacy is not something

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,250
that you just tack on at the end or that

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,680
it's just a project that you do because

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,050
you know once the project is done once

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,370
your business is built it really needs

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,290
to be something that you consider from

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,060
the very beginning when you're business

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,800
planning when you're wire framing your

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,930
website when you're deciding what tools

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,240
to use and then it's an ongoing practice

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:51,329
and thought process so I won't go too

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,690
deep into this I'm so sorry for the

00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:57,300
coughing I won't go too deep into this

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,510
but there are some really great videos

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,750
by Heather Burns on WordPress TV where

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:06,360
she goes really in-depth into the seven

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,130
different parts of privacy by design and

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,660
that's really where I got a lot of my

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:15,449
knowledge here and really appreciate

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:18,820
that so one of the hardest questions to

00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:20,320
answer is sometimes is what's personal

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,810
what is personal data what is the type

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,310
of data that we need to protect and

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,670
what's the type of data that we need to

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,110
talk about in our privacy policies that

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,140
we're writing and sharing on our website

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,710
well the most obvious ones name Social

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:38,290
Security numbers addresses those are the

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:41,020
usual identifiers credit card

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,500
information you know all those things

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,000
that that you're used to but the rest of

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,810
this list comes from the new California

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,460
law which means that we can be assured

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,350
that it's probably going to be applied

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,330
in more States laws and maybe any

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,490
federal law that we come up and it may

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,900
not look like at first glance that some

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,460
of these like have immediate

00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,580
implications to you but you might be

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,620
surprised so geolocation IP addresses

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,080
that you might be collecting from

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,840
visitors from from different tools might

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,860
show where that person's coming from

00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,470
California is saying that's personal

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:19,480
information biometric data if you know

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:21,120
fingerprinting I it's it's not I haven't

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,050
seen one but I'm sure they're out there

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,030
fingerprinting tools to log into your

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,580
WordPress website how are we protecting

00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,530
that that you know those those

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,540
fingerprints or whatever it is from that

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,700
tool that you might be using I know you

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,350
you're not creating that tool but you're

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,510
still responsible for making sure that

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,910
whoever did is is protecting that data

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,850
if it's if it's anyone that's visiting

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,860
your site that needs to use it

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:47,260
browsing history so if you're tracking

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,120
you know which pages they're visiting on

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,160
your site and you're able to assign

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,780
those to an individual user the

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,560
California law is is saying that those

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,180
are personal information psychometric

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,710
data so where do I keep having to look

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,420
up but anything that's maybe educational

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,220
brain brain based if you have quizzes on

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,110
your site or if you're learning

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,060
something about personality traits or

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,530
something like that you know you may

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,060
have something like this on your site

00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:15,490
and that's considered personal

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,440
information if you're making inferences

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,750
which we're doing more and more about

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,390
our visitors we're saying how we noticed

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,010
you visited my site from Twitter so I'm

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,660
gonna show you this particular piece of

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,670
content you're making an inference about

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,430
that person how you could make that

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,960
inference or collect that data can be

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,710
considered personal information so the

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,690
point of this slide

00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,610
that it's not just those usual things we

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,200
have to really start thinking about way

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:44,920
more than that which can be a little

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:47,290
overwhelming and we can't talk about

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,930
privacy without also talking about

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,580
security and this isn't at all a

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,870
security talk I mean I know there was a

00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,450
great one yesterday there's probably one

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,240
today but these are just some quick

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,910
things in your privacy policy you have

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,250
to attest to or share or you should

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,550
share some of the ways that you are

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,170
safeguarding the data that you have so

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,270
that's where security comes into play so

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,250
choosing a quality host from someone

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,520
that you know may sponsor a WordCamp or

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,840
something like that

00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,010
plugins themes your WordPress core

00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,660
making sure that they're up to date

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,850
making sure that there's no

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,470
vulnerabilities than anything there this

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,940
is a given now I can probably take it

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,760
off the slide but making sure that you

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,080
have SSL in place Google's really

00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,530
helping us make sure that we all have

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,670
that two-factor authentication even for

00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,440
yourself if you're the only person

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,330
that's logging into your site you know

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,250
using one of the plugins jetpack I think

00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,140
has one with wordpress.com there's quite

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:44,950
a few others that will enable it some

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,920
sort of two-factor authentication you

00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,360
know for logins and then there's a ton

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,950
of good security plugins that we can

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,760
talk about the pros and cons of those

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,960
two privately that may be something that

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:04,030
you want to make sure that you have in

00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:07,780
place if you don't already so this slide

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,130
is probably my least favorite and it was

00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,200
the least favorite part of the process

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,630
for me but the most important so when I

00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,180
was going through our process of

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:20,530
reworking through our privacy policy I

00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:22,209
had to do a complete data audit for some

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,800
of us is for some of us and on some

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,440
sites this is pretty quick and simple

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,670
and I'm the checklist that I shared kind

00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,380
of walks you through the things that you

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,590
need to look through but you might be

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,270
surprised even on my personal blog I

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,370
found tools that I had forgotten that I

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,050
had installed like six years ago that

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,060
were sitting there collecting some data

00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:43,330
that that I didn't know were there and

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,130
so I needed to I for me and we'll talk

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,600
about that on the minification plan but

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,000
turn those off right if I

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,770
not using that data why collected so the

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,590
first part is really doing that complete

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:57,520
data audit is your host collecting data

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,929
on traffic from you know you need to ask

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,450
these questions be able to find that out

00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:03,280
if and they probably are and that's fine

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,840
I'm not saying they can't it's just that

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,669
you have to know about it and document

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,460
it so that if something happens you're

00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:12,190
able to find it or do you have email

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,780
list where are those email lists kept or

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,669
are they kept in a place that's

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:19,120
following best practices that sort of

00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:20,559
thing are you using a CRM or some sort

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,730
of marketing tool similar to the email

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:27,549
list that you know has a lot of customer

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,220
data databases things like that cookies

00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:32,710
that's a big one we're all used to those

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,500
really fun cookie pop-ups on every

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,360
single website that we visit which is

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,100
probably the dumbest thing in the

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,059
history of the world at least the

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,039
internet but you know we have to know

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,110
what cookies are on your site and this

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,409
is a little embarrassing to admit on one

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,570
of our sites I did a cookie scan and we

00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:56,020
had hundreds and hundreds of cookies

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,000
that there was just no need for most of

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,730
them because the site was 15 years old

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,740
and think we're still using like just

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,419
legacy code legacy themes that we just

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,100
keep improving and hitter rating on and

00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:08,260
things we don't we never take anything

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,850
away which we should and we learned a

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,669
lot through this process and we were

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,440
able to really start paring back what

00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:16,270
those cookies are but also it's

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,100
perfectly fine to have cookies on your

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,600
website obviously we see those cookie

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,460
notifications everywhere everybody has

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,620
them we just have to be able to explain

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,669
what they are and explain why we have

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,860
them why are we using that and then make

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,590
sure that whenever they can they are

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,960
following best practices for people to

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,730
be able to turn them off or use the

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,460
browser tools to not track and stuff

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,230
like that do you have a contact form on

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,480
your site that's collecting personal

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,669
data someone's email address is coming

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,809
through where's that being stored is it

00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:49,419
being stored in the WordPress database

00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:51,370
is it going right to your email all that

00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:54,400
sort of things so you just just document

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,080
it I'm just making a list writing down

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,510
all of the different things that I found

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,460
that our businesses are are doing

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:03,010
and keeping track of them and that was

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,799
definitely step one we have user

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,570
profiles what data were we asking why

00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,450
are we asking for all of this user

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,340
profile information from our customers

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,520
was it really that useful were there any

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,980
that we could turn off or hide or are

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,900
not asked anymore all good questions

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,610
what analytics tools are you using are

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,740
you using you know Google Analytics we

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,150
probably all are other stat tracking

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,240
tools that you might have in place and

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,070
then really significantly payment

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,220
information if someone's paying you

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,990
where's that data stored hopefully none

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,049
of us have direct credit card

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:40,179
information of our customers at all

00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:41,890
there's there's tools and ways around

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,179
having that and having access to that

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:50,380
these days that we should just have in

00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:52,390
place so once we have this giant list in

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,770
some cases and it may be a small list in

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,570
some cases of all the different ways

00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,340
that we have all this data let's see if

00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,230
we can minimize it let's see if there's

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,160
anything we can take away we can delete

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:07,679
if there's not any or even if there is

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:10,840
are there things that we can do to like

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,760
itemize or document that maybe we're

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,960
only gonna keep these records for five

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,730
years and then we're gonna delete them

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,679
do we have a plan to make sure we do

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,360
that all this stuff is overwhelming

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,850
but it's just kind of the right thing to

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,520
do you are going to be much better off

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,950
if you're not holding on to 15 years of

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,270
data like we were when the first 10

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,750
years of data is totally not useful

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,549
today

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,410
right we're not using it so why do we

00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:35,309
keep it let's just get rid of it we're

00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,309
gonna be better off for it

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,120
you have to have a disaster recovery

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:48,549
plan in your privacy policy where you

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:51,730
should and I in the checklist that I

00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:53,590
provided have some sample language that

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,630
you can just use if you have just a

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,070
simple backup and restore option with

00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,470
your host that's great

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,000
is this enlike a big lengthy thing that

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,110
you have to think about but the one

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,580
thing that I want to talk about with the

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,370
disaster recovery plan is you'll be

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,559
surprised you don't have to admit it I

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,950
suppose but think about the last time

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,960
you tested if your backups work for me

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,760
on some of my sites it could be never I

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,740
know I have backups there but I've never

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,080
actually seen if I could restore from

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,270
them it's kind of scary and we kind of

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,900
learned that through this process and so

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:28,929
I've implemented regular checks and now

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,809
it's someone in our company's job to

00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,610
make sure that those that are useful but

00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:36,669
if it's you know off my personal blog I

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,380
just have gotten used to just doing a

00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:41,169
backup restore just because I need to

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,090
just want to make sure that it works and

00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:48,640
in most cases you know it should be fine

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:51,419
but better to be safe than sorry you

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,039
have to have a breach notification plan

00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,780
in your privacy policy and again and

00:22:54,039 --> 00:23:00,820
give some sample languages that you can

00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:02,980
that you can pull from but I have a

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,190
bunch of templates basically that are

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,730
scary to look at that if something bad

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:13,450
happens we are ready to go we know you

00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,070
know in our case we have a large list of

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,020
customers so if that data was ever

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,570
exposed somewhere we need to be able to

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,159
contact them quickly in most cases it's

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,840
within 48 hours that's what the law is

00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,669
saying these days of you becoming aware

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,210
of the breach that doesn't give you much

00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,500
time

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,659
right and that's even harder because

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,000
this goes against totally everything

00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:37,150
else and all of the privacy best

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,669
practices of having customer data in a

00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:42,309
like if someone asks you to remove their

00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:43,330
information from your database and then

00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:47,140
you have a breach you have no way of

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:49,750
contacting yeah so it's kind of a you

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,780
know they're you're not gonna win

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,020
basically you just have to realize that

00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,330
so

00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,130
once I realized that that's you know

00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,360
gdpr kind of brought this through and

00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,280
we'll talk a little bit about it but

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,020
that's something that you also have to

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,500
be able to do is if someone requests

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:08,290
that you destroy delete or anonymize all

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,170
of their data you you have to do that

00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,580
I personally at first thought this is

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,200
great I'm gonna go to every like little

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,660
thing I've ever signed up for and and

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,010
delete it but now I'm thinking you know

00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,990
I want them to be able to contact me if

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,590
they need to so it's just something to

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,590
think about

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,280
and that's what I was talking about

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,110
these are more new tools that also are

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,610
in WordPress core that you may have not

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,950
seen before but they're under the Tools

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:38,320
menu where you can export data by a

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,280
username that's it within WordPress

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,160
which is pretty cool

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,600
and people there's there's ways and

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:48,460
hooks and things in there we can have

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,930
people request that their data so if you

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,220
have a wordpress site that has users

00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,110
that sign up for different things these

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,480
tools are already available to you you

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,730
just have to know how to make sure that

00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,470
your if you have users or things like

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,120
that they know how to access them so

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:05,100
putting that information in your privacy

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,200
policy is important and we definitely

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,960
especially around GDP our time when it

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,370
was first implemented had not as many as

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,750
we were prepared for but we definitely

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,400
had quite a few people reach out and be

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,740
like I want to get rid of everything

00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,340
that that you have on me so people

00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,340
definitely do it

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,050
so we've gone through the checklist it

00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:32,130
was a lot but now we're ready to publish

00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:33,840
and I will say for years thanks to the

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,170
good people at automatic that published

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,690
their there a lot of their stuff and

00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,930
open-source Creative Commons way back

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,420
when when we realized that we definitely

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,860
use that for our company privacy policy

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,650
and you know attributed it and

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,950
everything so I'm assuming it's cool for

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:55,320
all of us to do that they you know have

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,410
a great privacy policy that that we can

00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,960
that is Creative Commons and you can go

00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,540
in and basically we are just doesn't

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,470
look like it as much as it used to but

00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,730
it definitely started that way and just

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,080
kind of fill in the blanks remove the

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,490
things that aren't relevant to you add

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,750
the things that are missing that are

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,260
relevant to you and it's a good place to

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,150
start

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,740
our company's privacy policy there is

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,740
there and you're more than welcome to

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,720
use anything that's there in terms of

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,300
you know if you want to copy/paste some

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,390
language update it and change it but

00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,980
also WordPress itself has default

00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,500
privacy policy page and that's what I'm

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,710
going to show you and demo it with a lot

00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:42,690
of text to that that you can use it as a

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:46,500
great place to start and another thing

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:48,810
to really talk about is consent and this

00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:53,730
isn't really part of building your

00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:55,800
privacy policy but it is part of you

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,480
know how do you have people opt-in to

00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,990
your privacy policy are you really

00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:04,610
asking for consent and some things gdpr

00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:08,340
really made specific but other other I

00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:10,080
mean it's just good makes good sense you

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,370
don't want someone to opt-in for

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,280
everything you're ever gonna do to them

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,540
and and in the future all at once what

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,630
it says is that it really needs to be

00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:21,960
broken apart so they're not opting into

00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:25,530
your email lists and your Terms of

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,390
Service and that you're gonna call them

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,890
on the phone and everything else that

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,570
that might happen with your business all

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,310
at once in one big statement that just

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,650
says I confirm you have to break it

00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,330
apart and let them know what it is that

00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,880
they're consenting to and

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,260
line by line item so we're probably

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,399
getting used to seeing more and more

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,169
those as you're signing up to new

00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:45,120
services where it breaks it apart

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:47,880
for example even in just our email a

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,970
list we have a weekly email list and

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,460
three times a week email list and then

00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,470
the only email me if you really need to

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,090
tell me something important list so we

00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,010
let people choose from those so when

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,690
they sign up they have to go through

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,399
that which is kind of a pain point you

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,799
know the the business folks don't want

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,179
in the marketing folks don't want to put

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,580
a lot of choices in the funnel because

00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:12,809
it slows people down but it's just an

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:18,200
obligation that we have and this is why

00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:20,630
I was okay with me a non-lawyer to

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,590
basically own our privacy policy

00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,320
everything needs to be in friendly

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:28,409
language and and understandable so I

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,779
think it's it's only fair that it's okay

00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:33,090
that it may not be in super legalese in

00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,679
fact it's preferred that it's not and

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,350
that all goes back also to the

00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,000
risk-based approach right you know if

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,210
you're a giant Google or Facebook

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,950
company your your terms and privacy and

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,380
stuff is probably you're gonna want to

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:50,279
be more ironclad than my personal blog

00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,470
for example and the just-in-time means

00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,480
that you're not asking for consent all

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,399
up front and at once you're only asking

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,690
when it makes sense to ask and you and

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,639
you keep asking when it when it makes

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:04,080
sense to so I'm gonna jump over to some

00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:07,710
demo and then we can do some questions

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,769
but you may have noticed some really

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,230
dumb pomp puns the puns were all I stole

00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:15,480
from our marketing team from our whip so

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,269
I can take no credit for that but wanted

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,279
to share and all the images I also stole

00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:24,019
right off our blog so I wanted to just

00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:27,649
give credit from that and I'm gonna try

00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:27,649
