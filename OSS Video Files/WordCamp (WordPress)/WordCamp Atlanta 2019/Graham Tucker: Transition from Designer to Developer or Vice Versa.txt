hi thank you so much for coming I'm

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,490
hoping that you're having a good time

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:14,670
and we're camp Atlanta you are part of a

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:19,500
community you're a part of a large

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,020
family of designers developers people

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,410
who write code people who write markup

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,740
programs people who lose their

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,059
microphones so thank you for coming my

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,219
name is Graham like Stephen said this is

00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:37,200
a presentation about folks who are

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,260
considering transitioning from a

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,840
designer role to a developing role

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,690
people who do want to learn code and

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,399
those who don't want to learn code

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,770
welcome and those who already know code

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:57,719
I'm gonna go over some things that will

00:00:49,770 --> 00:01:01,770
be helpful with design so in 1997 before

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,710
my career even started I decided I had

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,930
two choices I could go to college or I

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,119
could not go to college and for me that

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,430
was not really a choice I had to go to

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,520
college I really wanted to I loved

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,990
education I love learning I loved you

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,939
know finding out new things I loved

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,100
exploring so in 1997 I didn't really

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,490
have a way to go to college so instead

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,439
of going to college I did a totally you

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,900
know a totally logical and practical

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,270
thing let a lot of people probably a lot

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,630
of you in the room have done I enlisted

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,790
in the Marine Corps okay so not

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:45,899
everybody has joined the Marine Corps I

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:49,860
did and that was sort of my way to get

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,490
into college and I think I made the

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,329
right decision

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,060
it took me five years and I worked with

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,009
other people that wrote code and it was

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,930
not the code that you're used to if you

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,719
do develop and you write code

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,110
it's called Morse code got a lot of that

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,849
and it's silly but anyways we're not

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,440
here about that we're not here about me

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,319
we're here about you we're here about

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,109
your choices you chose to come to this

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,870
discussion and some of you want to learn

00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:22,469
code some of you already know code and

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,659
you want to design how many designers or

00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,459
non coders do we have here you can raise

00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,760
your hand it's okay I promise I won't

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:34,319
die right - okay how many people develop

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,239
a lot of developers so are you looking

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,150
for something that you might might have

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,950
helped you design yes okay so there's a

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,349
lot of developers it's usually the other

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,500
way around that's fine just skip over

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,889
this stuff I'm going to talk about for

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,620
writing code

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:54,840
you probably already know HTML CSS PHP

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,699
JavaScript and that's fine my

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,340
presentation I decided instead of

00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,620
showing my design or or my code or any

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,199
of my websites I'd go out and I get some

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,540
other people's designs some artwork

00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,879
that's all I'd share that with you you

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,859
can actually see some of this artwork on

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,780
Park Street in East Atlanta there's a

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,469
tunnel on that Street and you go through

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,180
it you see a lot of cool artwork

00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:20,159
yes it's graffiti has a street art it's

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,430
somebody designed it somebody thought it

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,129
up that's pretty much designed let me

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,629
get through the code and why do you want

00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:33,419
to write code for the couple of people

00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:35,459
that want to learn code it's kind of an

00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,280
open-ended question if anybody wants to

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,959
answer that they if they have a specific

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,389
reason they want to write code does

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,340
anybody know okay all right well let's

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,500
just set some expectations if you're

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,629
going to jump into code you're going to

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,819
jump into PHP HTML you're going to build

00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:57,180
websites you're gonna see a slight

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,669
increase what you get paid I know this

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,609
because I googled it well there's a lot

00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,859
of research involved in that one you're

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,329
going to commit to a life of learning

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,269
and education you're going to have two

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,979
communities continuously teach yourself

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,780
you might even choose to teach other

00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:18,539
people which is great I highly encourage

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,039
that yes pass on what you know so you're

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,510
you're going to learn more you're going

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,919
to get a little bit more money and

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,800
you're going to get a few more

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,990
opportunities so if you're learning code

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,720
and you design you're gonna have another

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,900
skill set and when you go into an

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,849
interview and they say do you design

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,129
tell them a little bit but you know code

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,919
because that wait remember the Google

00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:43,599
research yes okay you'll get more money

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,470
that's key all right

00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:50,310
that's we're here to learn we're we're

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:55,300
here on a weekend just like Chris said

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:58,780
and do you please lose audio no we're

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,629
good so just like Chris said we could be

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,840
doing anything on a Saturday but instead

00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:07,479
we're here learning so kudos to you you

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:20,620
did good you made a good choice you're

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:23,550
using your time wisely so the why why we

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,020
wonder learn code is because you want to

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,819
build out some designs or you want to

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,110
build a website and you want to share

00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,520
that with other people and when you do

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,009
share you have an immense responsibility

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,900
because you are publishing your

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,419
publishing content on the internet and

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,130
anybody can go on it and anybody can see

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:42,550
it when you're on Facebook you're on

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,710
Twitter any of the many things that you

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,569
can find on the Internet you are posting

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:51,960
things you are publishing you are an

00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:54,610
author you're an author with

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,219
responsibilities responsibilities to

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,500
others responsibilities to yourself and

00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:02,110
if you are going to open a business and

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,060
do business people are going to see what

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,460
you've published so you are an author

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,680
but you're also telling a story and

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,569
whether it's with code or whether it's

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,819
with design you are an author if you

00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:21,340
want to learn code I want to encourage

00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:23,289
you to try to adapt and accept a new

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,830
mindset that's the thought process and

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:29,680
that is that you don't know everything

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:32,169
it is a learning process and it's a

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,199
little bit it's involved it takes a lot

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,639
of time sometimes there's there's folks

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,870
that can pick it up they can pick it up

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,120
quickly that's great

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,389
if that's you awesome

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,880
if it's not you that's also awesome if

00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:48,250
you can't get code if you can't get HTML

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,350
and CSS and some of the other things

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,090
down in a hundred days keep going

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,729
you don't have to do it a hundred days

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,360
so 100 days of code is great that's

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,650
awesome

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,650
but if you won't go past that that's

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,530
that's really good too there's I'm gonna

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,330
go over a few things that will help you

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,010
and you can check that out and that will

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,470
help you learn they're everything and

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,729
I'm presenting today is free so you can

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,380
go on there you're you don't have to

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,130
worry about trying to find out what's

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,389
the catch

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:18,220
alright free for twenty days so when you

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:21,010
are learning I understand that you could

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,800
be wrong and understand that you're

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,770
going to make mistakes you're going to

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,690
fail even you can make mistakes you have

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,639
to make mistakes in order to make a

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:36,820
success so be wrong learn from it and

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,060
then if you do make a mistake make a

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,340
mistake in a safe environment or

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,490
sandboxing as we call it do it on a

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,099
testing environment and make sure you

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,110
test your stuff before you put it up in

00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:53,700
the internet you can do that locally or

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:56,979
you could or you could do it online

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,500
there's when you're using WordPress you

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:02,500
can elect to publish a page or you can

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,110
elect to just view what it would look

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,630
like so always check your work before

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,760
you publish it you think that that's

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,099
common sense and everybody here does it

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,410
but sometimes we forget sometimes we

00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:16,510
have that project managers like where's

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,199
where's my stuff I need I need it

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:23,410
yesterday so don't let them persuade you

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:27,099
don't let them make you make mistakes

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:30,849
if you do fail fail forward and then

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:33,010
repeat the process repeat what you do in

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:36,580
it if you have to fail again if you have

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:41,229
to make more mistakes do so so as

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:46,779
authors you're going to be building

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:50,020
websites and you're going to be you're

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:51,490
going to be designing and if you're here

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,260
to learn more about design we'll get to

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,860
that in just a minute but for those of

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,480
you who are

00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:01,510
to learn more code ask for help ask to

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,610
find somebody that can help you out find

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,720
somebody that you can kind of latch on

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,130
to and learn from them okay you can tell

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:16,390
them going back to learning because it's

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:19,660
important for code that mindset of

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,370
learning new things understand that what

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,339
you're learning is not rocket scientists

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:28,680
or not rocket science it is a bit tricky

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:31,480
it's not easy it's a new language

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,370
learning a new language in school you

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,209
might have picked it up you might have

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,730
just neglected it knots you know you can

00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:43,140
learn Spanish and then not go to Spain

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,540
and you kind of let it go that's okay

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,160
but code you have to learn it you have

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,890
to keep learning it and there's new

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:56,829
things but because it is a new language

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:59,829
it's a it's a bit hard especially when

00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,750
you're talking to a computer the

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:03,490
computer can only tell you so much it

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,529
can only tell you your error codes are

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,959
here or there but if it doesn't tell you

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,670
how you made the error you might need

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,350
somebody to help you so that's when the

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,920
importance of asking for help

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,140
and also looking for help look for help

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,839
in the right places there's there's

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:24,190
quite a few websites you can go on to

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,529
you go on the internet you find it

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,170
pretty much anything you need to and

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:32,790
I'll get to those in just a second

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:35,470
logic is something that we use in code

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,779
if you write something and publishing it

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,010
doesn't look right and it's wrong they

00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,199
see the writer it's wrong when you

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,870
publish it hopefully you get it right

00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:45,370
before you publish it so when you're

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,440
going through code and you're going

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,800
through stuff and it doesn't work it's

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,399
wrong logic

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:56,230
all right so free code camp is one of

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,470
the sites that you can go to you can

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,000
start up an education you know path and

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,040
because you're here you want to learn

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,500
more about your career you want to learn

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,570
about a new path that's one of the

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,490
things and also by the way at the end

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,500
this presentation the slides are

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,060
available on a website which I'll put up

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,880
there so that you guys if you're

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,209
scurrying to get this before I go to the

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,699
next slide

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:23,290
don't worry about that so free I'm sorry

00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:25,630
what website it's going to be the last

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,759
slide I'll put it up there and they'll

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,649
have all these slides absolutely if

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,889
there's any other questions also if feel

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:35,709
free to ask a list of part comm is a

00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:39,190
great site that's where I learned about

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:44,170
responsive web development anybody new

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:46,449
Marco no okay so he wrote a really great

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,819
article about responsive web design and

00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:51,910
CSS and how to make your sites

00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:54,759
responsive I highly recommend that but

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:58,720
that's just one of many many articles on

00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:01,600
a list of part calm development

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,759
mozilla.org and w3schools calm those are

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,060
two great resource websites that you can

00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,509
go you can find answers so yes

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:21,730
absolutely check that out

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:25,120
sorry I'm getting loud all right so HTML

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,250
CSS PHP JavaScript some of those things

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,480
are totally foreign to you but a lot of

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,920
you raise your hands you're already

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,240
developers you know what that stuff is

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,040
that's fine

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,319
for those of you who have no idea what

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,160
that stuff is you kind of need it to

00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:42,250
build websites you should kind of just a

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,410
little bit CSS is huge because that's

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:49,060
everything forward-facing it's built on

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:51,819
top of HTML PHP takes that markup

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,720
scenario and it really injects it with a

00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:56,130
lot of more power

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,930
Jeff question oh okay

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,810
javascript is like you're programming

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,600
like PHP that you can do functions and

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,509
you can make variables and you can do

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,130
that sort of awesome stuff and this is

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:13,079
kind of what you need for web

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:19,100
development along with WordPress and

00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:24,350
when I got into WordPress which is 2000

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:26,720
2012 I didn't I didn't know anything

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,730
about it so a lot of the the people that

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,259
I meet don't really know anything about

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,699
code they don't know about WordPress I

00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:35,000
don't know about what you can do with it

00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:35,810
and a gentleman named Calvin helped me

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,940
out at work

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,620
said listen you're asking me all these

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,139
questions and it's really annoying I

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,350
have a job to do like sorry and he said

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,639
go to the Codex and I have had no idea

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,850
what he's talking about I was completely

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,880
clueless but I checked it out and it's

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,410
got a lot of answers on there so if you

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,209
are looking for answers which I said

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,850
earlier you should be searching for

00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,079
things searching for the answers and

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,040
that's how you educate if you could

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,829
educate yourself that's it's phenomenal

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,259
you need that you need wordpress.org so

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:10,670
go to codex check that out you can learn

00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:13,550
about the core you can learn about

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:17,139
themes you can learn about plugins I've

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:19,910
worked on all three I focus on themes

00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:22,250
I've made a plug-in it's like three

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,279
lines of code it's sad but it's it's

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,339
mine I use it I love it there's nothing

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:32,740
wrong with admitting that you're sad but

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:35,240
I probably made 50 themes I've

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:41,360
customized the core what you shouldn't

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:44,740
do whatever I did it anyways and it's

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:49,100
fun I love WordPress that's why I'm here

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:52,610
so where does that leave you okay

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,440
you are wanting to learn code I I

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,610
honestly want you to learn code too

00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,490
I want you to learn it so hard that

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,600
you'll be able to talk to somebody and

00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,790
when you're talking to them you start

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,199
talking about Diaz and oh my float isn't

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,510
canceling what do I do

00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:10,430
and somebody just looks at you like

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,810
you're absolutely crazy I want that for

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,680
you

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:18,439
I want that because it's it's then

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,389
you're like oh no what else do I say

00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,550
because I've completely lost a person

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:24,529
and I'm sure because everybody a lot of

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,380
you raise your hands you probably have

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,399
talked to people about code and they

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,089
have no idea what you're talking about

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,750
that's okay it's okay if you're speaking

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:39,410
a different language

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:41,330
somebody we need you we need you if you

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,490
are a designer and you think differently

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,310
we need you we need your creativity and

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,900
we need you determination there may be a

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,090
scenario and I hope this happens to

00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,940
nobody in this room where somebody that

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:56,930
you know or you like question what you

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:59,630
do and they will say are you sure about

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:04,250
this coat thing are you sure about HTML

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:05,660
why why do you want to learn this I I

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,850
don't I don't think you did a good job

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:12,890
on that project are you sure that code

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:15,470
is really the answer I hope it doesn't

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,650
happen to anybody but people you love

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:22,040
people you know your friends they might

00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:24,890
question that and be ready for that have

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,660
a process to deal with that I think

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,830
Chris probably said it better than I did

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:33,890
Chris lemma his presentation was great

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:36,260
but have a way to just mentally work

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,730
through that the people are saying this

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,680
because they don't know they don't know

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,410
that you are speaking a different

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,490
language and they don't understand that

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,380
probably they're insulting you in the

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,900
work and the hours and weeks that you've

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:51,290
put into your designs so if you're a

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:53,990
designer come learn code learn that you

00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,089
need to keep learning learn that it's a

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,000
different mindset it's a language and it

00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:01,160
takes a lot of patience so please be

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,770
patient with other people please be

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:08,660
patient with yourself okay so this is

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,760
car Street well I was talking about

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,089
earlier this is where all that artwork

00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,069
is that all that good stuff up there you

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:20,180
can walk up and down either side of it

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:22,010
and it's it's great you'll meet kargh

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,819
street it's kargh

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,780
it's Krug sorry croc pricked krahgg

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:35,140
street hmm

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:39,500
see all right side kr OG @ j g g k ROG

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,000
yeah it's East Atlanta can't remember

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,980
the name of that town but it'sit's near

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,140
the Beltline it's groovy check it out

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,730
absolutely highly recommend that if you

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,200
like graffiti

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:54,730
you'll be there for quite a while Old

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,730
Fourth Ward okay

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:02,300
so a lot of love developers a lot of

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,620
people that already know code what about

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:25,610
design why do you need to know design

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:29,030
does anybody want to answer that okay

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,650
thank you she said so that it could your

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,310
website can look pretty or the project

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:37,880
can look pretty so it looks better

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:40,100
basically yes there's two different

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,620
distinctions between art and design art

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,290
is expression and that comes in many

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:50,900
forms you could have art through music

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:56,720
you could have art through poetry code

00:18:50,900 --> 00:19:00,530
is poetry but art is a much more broader

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:04,730
term design is art with constrictions it

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:07,870
is it is different than art because

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:11,000
you're trying to sort of sell or

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:14,420
persuade somebody to do something using

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,510
art it's a solution and it's typically

00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:22,850
used to sell a product to service an

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:28,250
idea but art is going to be bigger it's

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:30,530
it's gonna cover a lot more instead of

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,920
actually trying to define design I

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:37,250
decided I would plagiarize and just take

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,500
Mike Montero's definition this is from

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:45,910
one of his books check him out on

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:48,380
YouTube design is will accomplish that

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,760
it will make your site's look better it

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,280
will make your advertisements look

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,430
better it'll make your pamphlets that

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,870
your you know your school organization

00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,640
or something that you devote time to

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,470
it'll make it look better all around

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,799
there's some concepts that

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,480
you need to kind of grasp because a lot

00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,450
of you publicly probably have already

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,559
jumped into Photoshop if anybody here

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:16,240
has used photo

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:21,940
couple just about everybody okay so yes

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:25,600
you while you're designing you need to

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:28,940
really consider what you're trying to

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:34,240
express or you could consider what you

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,240
think your audience wants to hear okay

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:39,200
take into account what you need and what

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:44,120
you're selling and use a motion if you

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,100
use a motion you'll be able to control

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,010
your audience you'll be able to hold

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,900
them and you'll be able I hate to say

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:55,280
this but you're going to persuade them

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:57,260
and it is persuasion so design has a bit

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,360
of persuasion in it you need that you

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,010
we're not trying to trick somebody to

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,200
get their social security number so we

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,520
can get a better tax return because it's

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,110
somebody else's tax return or something

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,880
like that you're just trying to get them

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:14,590
to understand why they need this product

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:17,270
it's kind of helpful all right I'm gonna

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:20,120
welcome you all into the world of design

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,650
now when you're in development mode you

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,289
take somebody else's design and then you

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:26,299
kind of process it you have a process

00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,390
for building outside sir or anything

00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:31,760
else but in design somebody comes to you

00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:35,960
and says hey I think it would be great

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:40,730
if if you give me this design about it's

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,950
going to be a banana it's going to be a

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,919
banana but it's gonna be the best banana

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:49,549
it's gonna be like we need this ad for a

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,380
banana and we want something can you can

00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:53,840
you give it to me in like ten minutes

00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,520
okay I know you know what a banana is

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,370
and you know you can go to shutterstock

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,789
they get me the past banana and get it

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,470
to me like really fast and I can almost

00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:06,169
guarantee that you will go through

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:08,840
something similar to this you will have

00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:12,230
okay well there's the banana and then

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,740
you show it to your your client you show

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:18,130
it to your boss and the boss says that's

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:21,250
great banana I like it but could you put

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:24,400
some more while in that or maybe let's

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,850
change the shape of the banana and let's

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,679
call the banana banana because

00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,929
nanotechnology and bananas they go it's

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,300
just it's gonna be awesome this design I

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:36,090
can really feel it alright so by this

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,559
time you're kind of you have a headache

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,300
you're tired you're thinking about going

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,660
home

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,970
the banana maybe we could fit in the

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:50,260
photo shop and we could change the hue

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,780
to make it a blue banana or maybe we can

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,740
add a human element and a dancing banana

00:22:52,780 --> 00:23:01,660
has anybody seen that on the Internet

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:04,210
alright you have two peanut butter jelly

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,070
peanut butter okay so there's that

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,570
that's from the internet that's why we

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:12,010
love the internet because you have cats

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:14,320
and dancing bananas also Twitter at this

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,940
at this point in stage you keep going

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,980
back to the client and showing them all

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,260
these things and you're like okay I'm

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,580
pouring my heart into this project even

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,590
though I don't believe in it it's a

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,030
banana they're gonna they're gonna keep

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,020
going they're gonna keep going then you

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,330
just fire the client

00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,059
no I'm kidding there's actually there is

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,679
a point where your your client will say

00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,809
oh my god that's fantastic

00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,309
when all you've done was change the font

00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:40,870
weight from like eight hundred two

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:46,450
hundred yes I did it I made my client

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:48,190
happy so that's the design process it's

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:51,910
a it's a bit frustrating so be ready for

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,170
that developers logical people we build

00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,710
things we know if it's going to work if

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,970
it's gonna fail and we we have that fun

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,850
time with our computers and our

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:03,309
computers give us this verification yes

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,890
this is good no no keep trying oh that's

00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:09,790
good but in design you really don't have

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:12,580
that and when you're building or you're

00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:16,450
creating things try to keep some of

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:18,520
these concepts in mind contrast you're

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,309
gonna try to contrast to bring focus to

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,169
something like you could have a blurry

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,080
background but you could have a really

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:27,610
sharp text people are going to draw

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,210
their eyes are going to get drawn to

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,860
that sharp

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,480
tax you could use color also let go back

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,390
you can see the colors being used here

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,220
there's no there's no blurriness but

00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,740
there's you know your eyes really

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,030
brought into these colors they brought

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:48,100
into anybody know what that font is no

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:50,050
no all right well I'll come back we'll

00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,010
follow up get the answer to that

00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:55,930
question alignment so if you have text

00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,660
over here and you have a column over

00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,480
there and your text is great but it's

00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,000
not aligning with something else because

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,530
you have margins or you have padding

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,180
that doesn't belong there you'll you'll

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,550
you'll have a client you will have a

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,920
client that says no no no no this is all

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:20,020
wrong because like about five pixel

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:22,450
difference just be ready for that

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:25,720
because like anything else you just have

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,310
to keep going repeat the sort of things

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,000
that you built so if you're using blue

00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:33,340
and then you're using a lighter blue and

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,460
you use a dark blue and the texts or the

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,620
headers repeat that keep using those

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,890
blues and maybe use a complementary

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,870
color if you using contrasting color you

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:47,010
have to repeat contrast in color so

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:53,230
repetition is part of that all right

00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:57,040
 inkscape and Scribus a lot of you

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:59,220
use photoshop you can use a free tool

00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,080
it's called

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,030
I'll put a link to it it's actually

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,710
already up on the internet when I get to

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:08,970
the end of the slideshow you can go ride

00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,970
that for free yes

00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:32,970
yeah there's there's a couple questions

00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:37,290
in New York question her question was

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:39,210
she uses Photoshop and it's easy is

00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,980
designed a little bit well actually a

00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,430
lot like photo Photoshop so give that a

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:48,890
try

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:53,750
a/b do not use Photoshop for development

00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:56,100
go to word camped org learn learn code

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,600
now I know that there's probably a tool

00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,670
that you can push the button and it will

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:06,780
take all your designs and then push it

00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:28,470
out into HTML CSS is that okay you write

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:30,240
code okay great sure okay so your

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:35,660
question is how do you go from Photoshop

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,660
into a responsive design correct yeah

00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,490
keep doing what you're doing you can use

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,980
Photoshop you can use you can use

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:51,980
whatever you want you can use I'll just

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,980
in just a second okay go ahead sorry

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,880
and just stop and consider all of them

00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,920
at the same time and maybe want to see

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,720
them side-by-side the Photoshop is going

00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,800
to take you like forever to make that

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,320
circle XD and I've used em too but it is

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:20,060
really like

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:35,450
so you said dnx Adobe XD is what you

00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:46,250
should check out okay so so Adobe I see

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:47,780
great that it's a great point in and I

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,770
think with experience you you get a

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:53,300
better understanding my my div has

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:56,090
certain or I'm sorry my ro has certain

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,880
divs and they float etc ones on top ones

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,370
then I got two columns below it which

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,810
column goes first which which one falls

00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,980
underneath the other went using

00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:16,940
responsive dig into CSS find out what XD

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:18,470
is doing the DXR XD XD sorry and when

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,490
when you're looking at it in the browser

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:23,840
I want to say it's shift control I it's

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,820
going to bring up your code inspector

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,070
and you can see what's happening okay

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,110
you could roll over the content in your

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,180
browser and it'll highlight it for you

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:35,570
so that's another tool that you can use

00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:38,210
in both Firefox Chrome and the other

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:43,850
browsers there's a code inspector on all

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:47,420
the browsers so XD check that out and

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:50,600
now highly recommends using sort of

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:54,640
building code with Adam Daioh is a great

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:59,030
tool that I use you use that I'm sorry

00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,980
Adam dot IO it's Adam is is it's a word

00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:06,400
processor that shows you your code and

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:10,270
it'll show you your PHP your HTML CSS

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,270
yep yeah

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:18,259
all right so again my name is Graham and

00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:20,749
like I said I joined the Miller two mill

00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:24,230
of the military back in 1997

00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:26,389
the good news is I got out in 2002 I was

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:30,350
on a really discharge that's a good

00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:32,269
thing and then I went to I went to

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,669
college I gave myself a mission and then

00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:37,249
I accomplished it I got a degree and

00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:40,070
then you know I had to work my way out

00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:42,350
of design and into development and I had

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:46,279
to tell people that this is where you

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:48,470
can find these slides and this is all

00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:54,759
right there there are there any other

00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:54,759
questions yes

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,529
let me go back that one right there so

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,970
 is kind of like a Photoshop but

00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:17,370
it's open-source yes Inkscape is kind of

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,429
like illustrator but open-source so you

00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:23,909
have a tool for making raster images and

00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:27,240
bitmap images kind of like Photoshop and

00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:29,820
illustrator Scribus is kind of like your

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,360
adobe indesign it's like a page layout

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,009
system sorry I didn't I didn't repeat

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,860
the question the question was what is

00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:43,309
Scribus Scribus is going to be what I

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:47,879
just said all right I'm sorry

00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:50,279
correct so his question was this is like

00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:53,159
Adobe um it's sort of it's not really as

00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:55,110
powerful the Adobe products the is

00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,340
gonna get you really a lot of good

00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,289
results if you're working for with

00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,820
photography you're not going to get like

00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:01,200
batch processing you're not going to get

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,149
some of the other really cool tricks

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,740
that you're gonna get from Photoshop but

00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:07,169
you are gonna get a lot of the tools it

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,700
like you do clone stamping you can do

00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:10,230
selection you can do all those things

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,480
it's gonna be a little bit cumbersome

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:16,649
I'm actually in the process of adapting

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,789
that into my my flow my work process egg

00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:22,860
scape awesome I don't know a lot about

00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:26,340
Scribus I actually haven't used it that

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,740
much so I kind of have suggesting this

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,990
I'm not fully endorsing it but the other

00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:34,529
two I fully endorse screw this I'm sorry

00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:37,259
I fully endorsed and Inkscape does

00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:38,179
that help it's good okay any other

00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,179

JavaScript all right he'll he's the

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,220
question was about JavaScript and this

00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:33,710
other gentleman is going to help him out

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,290
but I've I think there's a JavaScript

00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:45,290
library called NPM does anybody else use

00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:51,650
NPM no js' okay thank you thank you

00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:54,350
appreciate that the answer was okay this

00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:56,150
this is outside my realm actually so I

00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:58,840
would not be the perfect person to ask

00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:01,820
that question going back to my slides

00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,200
ask questions but sometimes you might

00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,480
ask somebody that doesn't know the

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,910
answer so this is one of those times

00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,910
