Title: Chip Edwards: What Does Your Brand Look Like in a Voice First World-
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	With the explosive adoption of Smart Speakers, the primary interaction with your content will become auditory instead of visual. On the world wide web, your brand revolves around a URL, logo, tagline, color palette, font, images, etc., but when your audience is no longer seeing your content, traditional brand elements become invisible. In a voice first environment, when your audience just asks for what they want, they expect the answer to be returned verbally.   In a voice first world, what does your brand look like, (I mean, sound like)? In this talk, I explore the components of a verbal brand, how to prepare for the shift from written content to verbal content, as well as the future of voice technology and how to prepare for it.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,069
we uh as speakers we uh we need your

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,540
feedback let's put it that way that's

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,280
the only way we get better is when we

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,309
get the feedback and so what worked what

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,139
did not work so definitely so please go

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,869
there and help and give some feedback I

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,939
would appreciate it and by the way I

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,160
checked the thermostat back there it's

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:31,920
at 55 so everybody's fine right now just

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:36,030
so you know okay I feel good yeah okay

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,600
Amazon Apple and Google are changing how

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,989
your audiences react and interact with

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,110
computers they're working hard to reduce

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,989
the friction by making a way for your

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,860
audience to use voice first and resort

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,960
to their screens only when needed this

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,420
is creating a number of challenges and

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,980
opportunities when it comes to branding

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,750
so in the next thirty minutes I want to

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,710
touch on the components of a traditional

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,600
brand compared to a verbal brand then

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,720
look into what it means to write for

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,150
voice and why it's important

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,250
to write for voice and then we'll touch

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,500
on the future of voice technology and

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,119
then we'll wrap up with a Q&A session so

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,840
when I see traditional branding

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,299
components we not only understand the

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,759
products behind the branding but we also

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,759
have a feeling and expectation about the

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,579
product building a brand is important

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,729
and as we'll see your brand name will

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,079
become critical in a voice first world

00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,970
each of these branding elements that

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,750
I've listed on the screen here work

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,520
together to create a visual brand but

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,500
only one of them actually translates

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,540
directly to a verbal brand consumers

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,670
have been moving to smaller screens and

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,740
we know that and the recent smart

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,750
speaker trend is actually causing

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,500
another shift in the effectiveness of

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,000
traditional branding elements you're

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,390
probably familiar with all of these

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,770
company logos from the Golden Arches to

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,830
the Nike swoosh

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,350
these logos are a key part of visual

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,750
branding but they're hard to hear with

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,000
your eyes closed

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,700
so untraditional so in addition to logos

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,190
and icons many visual brands also use

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,600
slogans having a good slogan or tagline

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:37,740
helps you define your brand slogans work

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,430
in both visual and verbal mediums for

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,970
the love it

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,780
is Pepsi slogan when I say taste the

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:49,380
feeling we think Coca Cola on ice right

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,900
now that would be great I'm loving it

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:57,600
the golden arches right and when I say

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:59,400
just do it we think Nike right so it's

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,640
easy to recognize the importance of

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,730
verbal brands we protect these names we

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,400
protect these logos and slogans

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,100
copyrights and stuff like that and we

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,650
define a consistent use of colors and

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,200
fonts on our websites to help pull those

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,250
things together all of these things help

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,959
to create a valuable visual brand so now

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,910
let's look at the components of a verbal

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,800
brand while the name is a name the

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,780
auditory version of a name is

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,020
technically different than the visual

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,910
version of a name to highlight these

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,080
differences I got a slide in just a

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,850
minute we'll kind of look at some of

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,220
those differences and we'll we'll use

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,260
the idea of homonyms and hetero names as

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,700
far as to point that out but it's a

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,930
little bit more complicated but we'll

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,750
use that in the next slide that'll be a

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,810
little bit of fun the analog to a

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,900
brand's logo or icon as a brands as a

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,330
sonic brand sometimes referred to as an

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,440
ear con you see what they did with that

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,540
icon ear con yeah I know booth right now

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,030
sonic brands have been around for a long

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,040
time though and in a couple minutes

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:13,860
we'll play a game where we associate the

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:16,049
brand icon to their ear con a good

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,260
slogan or tagline can help you define a

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:21,930
brand creating a tagline helps you get

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,120
to the heart of your brand slogans and

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,220
tag lines helped both with visual and

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,830
verbal branding so slogans and tag lines

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,919
those are those are in port

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:34,280
but color palettes fonts and images they

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,620
don't have verbal components to them and

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,569
without them the content of your site

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,610
comes front and center so when we think

00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,590
about it I know think of any any website

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,139
you want to think of if you took that

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:50,940
site and you pulled all the images off

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,410
of it and then you pulled all the color

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,250
out of it so it's just black and white

00:04:52,410 --> 00:05:03,199
and then we removed all of the font

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:07,349
sizes and bolding what's left text words

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,740
either in text or in audio format and so

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,539
in a in a verbal world that's what we've

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,449
done we pulled all of those components

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:17,759
out and what are you left with you're

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,759
left with the words and the audio and so

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,440
those components actually become really

00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,750
important when you start talking about

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,889
your verbal brand and we'll talk a

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,139
little bit more of that in just a minute

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:33,509
okay so what's in a name in a verbal

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,849
world homonyms and hetero atoms cause

00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:42,000
challenges let's start with hetero names

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,949
okay so when you visit this site do you

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,539
expect to see a picture of a lead bass

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:53,190
player in an orchestra or a lead colored

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:56,099
bass from the lake or maybe a lead color

00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:01,280
covered bass guitar with a cool new

00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:04,740
sound it could be any of those right a

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,120
hetero name is a word that is spelled

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,870
the same but have different meanings

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:13,050
behind them homonyms on the other hand

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:18,090
are spelled differently but they sound

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:21,810
the same while these are all spelled

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:29,789
differently when you say them they all

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:34,540
sound the same so in a verbal world who

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:38,640
owns this right

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,360
you got four different sites but only

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,760
how do you do that

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,560
so verbal branding becomes a little bit

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,990
tricky and a little bit more complicated

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,460
when we talk about names names there's

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,510
not just simple it's not just the

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,160
spelling it's a little bit more

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,780
complicated than that so I was surprised

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,730
to look at the number of homonyms in the

00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,560
English language there are there are

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,930
hundreds by the way so if you look this

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,010
up there there are hundreds of hominins

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,960
in there in the English language in the

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,250
visual world domain names are important

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:15,070
in the verbal name the analog to that is

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,870
called an invocation name so let me

00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:21,070
describe an invocation name a little

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:23,700
better we all build websites these are

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:27,700
hosted on a computer with an IP address

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:30,880
the donate domain name is how a browser

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,010
references your website so just like

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,070
building a website in the voice world we

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,470
build what are called voice apps for

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,680
Google the voice app is referred to as

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:45,070
an action and in in Amazon's for world

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,250
voice app is referred to as a as a skill

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:52,900
but to reference them we use what's

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:55,570
called an invocation name Amazon allows

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:59,140
multiple voice apps to have the insane

00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:01,170
invocation name Google on the other hand

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:06,010
used the domain name model and

00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:08,170
invocation names are unique which means

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:12,700
that the first person to register an

00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:14,770
invocation name owns it so in our two

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:21,090
sense example the first person to create

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:24,070
the two sense voice app owns the name in

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:28,450
the visual world getting on page 1 is

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:31,110
good enough but in the verbal world when

00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:34,570
you ask for something you don't expect a

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,550
list of answers write a list of possible

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,000
in it in the verbal world when you ask

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:42,430
for something you expect the answer so

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,340
what's it mean it means that Google and

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,230
Amazon are going to decide what the best

00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,510
answer is

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:54,320
this is why owning and marketing your

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,990
brand is critical let's look at a couple

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,150
of examples from Amazon you probably

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,350
have all noticed this but when I point

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,390
it out it probably will make a little

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,590
bit more sense so I'm doing this

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,870
upholstery project and this upholstery

00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,780
supplies X's it's got a million staples

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,820
to remove and so I get the first piece

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,560
and I use this tack remover that I've

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,870
got at home and I'm popping out these

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,880
staples and I get the first layer off to

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,980
find out that there's another layer

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,440
underneath oh my goodness

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,210
I got staples to pull out so I'm

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,420
shopping on Amazon for an upholstery

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:32,590
staple remover these two seem almost

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:37,490
identical so in a voice first world

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:39,620
which one am I going to get if you do

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,750
much shopping on Amazon you'll notice

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,530
that they've been putting this amazon's

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,910
choice on their products ok so let's

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,380
look at another example it'll get a

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,700
little bit more clear here as we as we

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,070
go through there here's a couple more

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,400
items and when you look at the the

00:09:52,070 --> 00:10:00,400
description of each item

00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:03,140
notice the amazon's choice designation

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,870
here's where Brandie becomes critical

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,060
because guess what happens if I ask for

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,720
a chainsaw helmet instead of a steel

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:16,490
helmet that's right I'm going to get a

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,610
TR industrial hard hat branding trains

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:24,320
our audiences to ask for the still

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:26,990
helmet instead of the generic chainsaw

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,370
helmet so that's what we're trying to

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,160
accomplish when we're working on this

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,950
branding and verbal branding as is is

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,330
designating here's the here's the

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,250
invocation aimer here's the tag that

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,710
you've got to use to get to my stuff

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,320
because if we use the generic stuff then

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:45,110
amazon google they're going to decide

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,420
what's best but once you get into the

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,340
branded components now you start tying

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,890
into your brand as opposed to the

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,630
generic piece unless you've got really

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,330
really deep pockets I guess and you can

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,290
convince Amazon that the your product is

00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,290
the generic product

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,269
okay so let's let's look at Sonic

00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:07,410
branding this will be a fun game here

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,509
Sonic branding has been around for a

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,569
long time let's see how well brands have

00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:16,649
done at attaching their earcon to their

00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:24,899
icon so hopefully we'll get some sound

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:27,899
here M Jim all of us old-timers we if

00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:30,410
this was an easy one right okay how

00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,410
about this one

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:51,540
[Music]

00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:56,670
NBC good how about this one Samsung how

00:11:51,540 --> 00:12:02,999
about this one nope

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:05,639
we'll get there life's good LG t-mobile

00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:14,879
good they did a good job huh how about

00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:17,369
this one good okay so they just came out

00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,499
with the new Sonic brand in February

00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:22,139
they came out with this new one so you

00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:24,720
don't know this yet probably or unless

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,029
you've been paying attention MasterCard

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,040
that was masters cards new sonic brand

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,600
that they just came out with so you'll

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,730
be hearing more of that from MasterCard

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,850
pay attention to that one Intel there we

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,850
go

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,520
[Music]

00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:48,649
Pepsi okay so this last one this last

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,569
one is interesting and I'm gonna I'm

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,759
gonna do this one so listen to this one

00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,980
here because this one here they use

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,259
their sonic brand in a lot of different

00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,989
ways and a lot of different places and

00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:01,129
they tie it into the advertising that

00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:05,199
they're doing so listen to this one

00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:05,199
actually it's going to be multiple so

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,079
[Music]

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:26,789
[Music]

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,959
okay their sonic brand used in a lot

00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,670
it's the same jingle they just

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,130
integrated in a lot of different places

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:44,670
and when you hear that jingle you think

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:47,339
coca-cola yes that that sequence of

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,470
notes like that is there so yeah yeah

00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,209
so while sonic branding has been around

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,980
for a long time it's becoming more

00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:56,190
popular in part because of voice

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,019
technology Sonic branding works with

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,110
both visual branding as well as verbal

00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:03,360
branding so it's not just the big brands

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,240
that have er cons by the way if you

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,579
watch I mean listen you'll notice them

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,519
in many places and they're the auditory

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:15,120
cues that help you instinctively know

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,790
what's coming next so you'll you'll hear

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,750
them in alot podcasts I mean you'll hear

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,910
them across the board so pay attention

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,680
you'll hear hey I see here the same

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,230
thing every time this is about to happen

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,940
that's their ear con or their sonic

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:31,440
brand that they're tying to their stuff

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,329
sometimes we think about our brand we

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,180
focus on the flashy elements and miss

00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:39,209
the less visible ones but when we are

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,660
only listening and not looking the

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:44,370
visual branding elements don't exist

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,089
it's at this time when the less visible

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:50,130
less obvious components become critical

00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:53,100
when we are just hearing content the

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,750
content becomes the brand in this

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,459
section I'm going to provide a few tips

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,770
on how to prepare for voice and

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:02,089
hopefully pique the interest of some

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,089
early adopters and voice technology

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,690
since your content is an important part

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,910
of your brand let's look at two

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,890
components two major components which

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,920
impact how your brand is seen I mean

00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:17,010
heard first let's look at how your

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,010
content is organized and then let's look

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:22,260
at the actual form of your content so

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:25,170
let's start with how your content is

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,670
organized is your content grouped in

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,170
such a way that your content can be

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:32,490
found and delivered as you expect

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,750
grouping involves categorizing and

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,690
organizing your content

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,790
in two pages and headings with tags and

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,700
labels on them this is important from

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,400
two perspectives to make it easier for

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,320
Google and Amazon and Apple to be able

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,140
or even screen readers for that matter

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,830
to find the one answer from your content

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:56,220
and to to give a clue on how to deliver

00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:58,890
your content in other words how best to

00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,940
turn your content into audio let's look

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:06,240
at an example this is an excerpt from

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,940
one of one of my blogs the two versions

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,250
look very similar but the HTML coding

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,840
behind them has some slight differences

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,570
to them which I'll show you in just a

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:45,420
minute let's listen to the first part of

00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:47,070
these and see how they sound okay so

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,870
let's look at the HTML what's it look

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,000
like

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:58,770
notice that the first one specifies the

00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:00,780
font size and the pipe name but there

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,500
isn't a verbal equivalent to font sizes

00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:06,930
right and so when we turn this into

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,530
voice we just throw it away because

00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:12,990
there's nothing to do with the font size

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:16,980
and in the second one we specify hey

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,620
this is a heading headings provide

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,569
meaning which can be used to find this

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,589
section of your content as well as

00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:27,990
change the delivery of the audio so

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,080
using Guttenberg it's important that you

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,510
specify heading blocks as opposed to

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,450
text blocks reformatted to look like

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:40,410
heading blocks for those of us who are

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:42,510
still old-school HTML coding we get it

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,510
this way but if you're using Gutenberg

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,160
Gutenberg helps in a number of ways but

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,110
this is one of them where you you

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,050
the easy method of Gutenberg don't try

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:56,100
to second-guess it put in heading blocks

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:58,680
and it gives information both to the

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,020
readers as well as the audio side of

00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,490
those

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,860
okay the next organizational element

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,560
that impacts your branding is

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:09,120
descriptions pictures charts tables and

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,930
graphs they don't trance well into

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:17,880
translate well into audio these figures

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:19,740
are all visual in nature we put pictures

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,390
charts tables and graphs into our

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,370
content for one of three reasons as

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,900
decorations is the first reason

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,960
decorations add life and interest to our

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,910
website similar to colors and fonts

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:39,210
adding consistently themed decorations

00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:41,780
can enhance our brand these items can be

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,750
removed however without impacting the

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:48,120
content when we look at examples though

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,510
examples help your audience understand

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,190
the text these figures are not only add

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,870
color and interest they help people

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,730
understand your content from a different

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:04,350
angle and some decorative or figures

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:06,120
tables content these are supplemental

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,540
information and they provide additional

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,160
information that's not found in the text

00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,990
these types of charts are graphs or

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,460
tables contain information which we

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:20,130
expect our viewers to see or deduce if

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,050
the figure is not seen then some of the

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:27,060
content from your site is missing or not

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:29,280
fully understood for each of your

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,220
figures it's important to evaluate why

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,110
they exist this will help you ensure

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,870
that you handle them appropriately for

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,730
your verbal brand I'll show you the

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,590
mechanics of this in just a minute but

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,080
first let's discuss how to handle each

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:46,340
each of these four figures which are

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,480
descriptions just describe the image

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,670
described it in the same way that you

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,340
would you would describe a painting on

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,500
the wall to your blind friend he can't

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,950
see the image so describe it to him so

00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,810
he knows what's there four figures which

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,250
are examples however

00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,990
you're going to not only briefly

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,360
describe the image but you're going to

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:10,860
want to tell how the image supports your

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,390
text and for supplemental information

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,240
this is actually really critical because

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:19,350
lots of times we put tables in our in

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,020
our in our website and we expect people

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,740
to look through that table and pull out

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,470
information

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,170
well tables don't turn into audio very

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,960
well because you expected somebody to

00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:34,920
figure something out from that table so

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,840
it's important that you you specify what

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,820
did you want the person to understand

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,380
from this information and so this is

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,290
supplemental information that we've got

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,200
to now describe so in this one here we

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,300
not only describe the figure but we

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,340
point out the details that you expect

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,790
your audience to visually understand or

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,960
deduce from the figure there are two

00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,560
areas that we can use for this

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,690
information

00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:02,520
alt text and big caption right so here's

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,080
an example from one of my blog posts

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,410
this is an example of a graphic

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,510
decoration when the image is added to my

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:12,830
blog post it add life to the page but

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:15,450
not necessarily additional information

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,850
this image actually supports my visual

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:20,100
brand but it doesn't help my verbal

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,170
brand and that's because I didn't

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,020
caption it and I didn't put any alt text

00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,030
behind it while computers are pretty

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,070
getting pretty good at finding objects

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,080
inside of images and the like and

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,780
someday they may be able to describe

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,760
these things for us currently they don't

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,800
do it and so it's a manual step so I

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,780
know it's rough we but we got to do it

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,760
manually at this point so let's take a

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,410
look here if we fortunately Gutenberg

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,600
makes it easy to add these these

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:51,450
necessary tags at a minimum we need to

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,290
insert the alt text to convey the

00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:57,090
information about the image so if it's a

00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,950
decoration just describe the image this

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,770
is an image with tools for learning

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,930
including an Apple Smart speaker book

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:08,160
spin and a ruler pictures only used for

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:10,350
visual color now my wife tells me I'm a

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,540
detail person and so when I describe my

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,520
stuff I like bats everybody put all the

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,070
details in there she's like you

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,620
that's an image with school stuff so

00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:23,130
she's a big picture person and so her

00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,620
descriptions in her alt text or more big

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,940
picture E minor like yeah but the person

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,040
might want to know all the stuff that's

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,750
in there so it's it's kind of up to you

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,750
as far as you figure out exactly what

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,460
you want to communicate but that's the

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,460
place for it for the people who can't

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,530
see what the image that you put there

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,330
this is where you describe it put it in

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,810
the alt text because that's what they're

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:47,300
gonna hear for examples tell how the

00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,730
image supports your text and

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,050
supplemental as supplemental information

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:55,320
describe the infrared details of the

00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:57,500
image or table or graph that you expect

00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,850
the audience to visually understand

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,430
additionally insert a caption can be

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,710
useful both visually and verbally so

00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,290
that right here Gutenberg makes it easy

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:10,260
it's like you put an image here put a

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:14,070
caption on it so just click there type

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,590
the caption in so if I did that now my

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,390
my website would look like this as part

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,910
as you can see adding a caption appears

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,130
as part of the figure now so when

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,090
translating this into audio the image

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,210
will be ignored

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,770
however the caption can be read

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,020
something like there's an image with a

00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:34,290
caption which reads books apples and

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,330
smart speaker so now somebody will know

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,280
that hey there's an image there and this

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,070
is what you would expect to see if you

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,540
were seeing it well the alt text is not

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,220
visible it can be used to provide

00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:49,320
additional context about why you

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:53,400
inserted the image now let's look at the

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:56,910
details of our content diction diction

00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,030
is our choice of words an example would

00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:06,450
be I use do I use the word begin or

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:09,270
start or initiate or commence so diction

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,130
is I'm choosing words they all have the

00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,500
same similar meanings but I'm choosing

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,690
words on on purpose and we'll see why

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,520
that Wow that is important in just a

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,740
minute

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,690
grammar and syntax is how we structure

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,870
our words together ranging from simple

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:28,380
sentences think dr. Seuss to dense

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:30,930
complex syntax think like

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,960
Torro thesis and stuff like that as a

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:36,320
hint when we speak we often use simpler

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,480
sentence structures than when we write

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,000
so when writing for audio I found that I

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,400
need to simplify my writing to make it

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,900
easier to understand when Alexa or

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,450
Google turns my content into audio style

00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,710
style is how we choose to communicate a

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:59,580
thought or idea think news versus

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:02,760
teaching versus storytelling versus a

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:06,330
dialogue so let's dive into these a

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,770
little bit further okay in a minute I'm

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,250
gonna put on the screen something that

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:13,230
you've all seen from a Facebook post

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,450
it's a bunch of misspelled words that

00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:18,960
are that remind us how amazing our

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:21,450
brains are it seems that our brains

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,780
automatically translate what we see into

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,730
what we should be seeing this is there's

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,830
a downside to this though and many of

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,440
you probably run into this

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:36,060
I've often read my blog posts over and

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:40,410
over again and my brain seems to make

00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:42,450
everything look correct our ears don't

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,030
have this odd of this auto fix feature

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,740
quite as much as our eyes do so listen

00:25:45,030 --> 00:26:00,060
to this clip and see if you can decipher

00:25:46,740 --> 00:26:02,580
it yeah exactly see okay we read the

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,280
first sentence of this of this here okay

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,260
yeah it doesn't matter in what order the

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,210
letters or in a word are the only

00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,790
important thing is that the first and

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,410
last letter be at the right place we can

00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,420
read it right that's my that's my

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,910
problem with my when I'm writing my blog

00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,700
post I look at it and it's like I got

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:24,120
nothing on this it looks right but then

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,190
when you hear it it's like what I don't

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,050
know how many times I've listened to my

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:32,220
blog post afterwards I say I didn't do

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:34,610
that I look at it sure enough that's

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,220
what I did

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,950
okay well fixing errors errors should be

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,390
fixed that that's but contrary to my

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,060
English teacher what my English

00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,310
teacher taught me it's not true that our

00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,960
brands require us to use the King's

00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:55,110
English your brand should dictate the

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:58,920
diction grammar and style used on your

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:01,170
website we expect the language used by

00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,480
an MIT article to be different from the

00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,570
language used by the California surfer

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,980
blog right which should be different

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:12,600
than the Southern Miss Manners blog and

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,760
that should be different from the

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,320
moonshiners blog right we expect

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,480
different things from these different

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,230
environments on we expect different

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,390
things and so we wouldn't want to see

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,760
we've so we'll some leave it there

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,910
that's good enough your brand should

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,830
capture the attention of your audience

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,480
that's probably the key your brand

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:36,350
should capture the attention of your

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,000
audience let's look at a few examples

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:43,440
this first is from the mercedes-benz

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,450
website no car in its segment can claim

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,360
the performance pedigree of an AMG

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,430
c-class countless German Touring Car

00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,890
championships fill its trophy case and

00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:55,320
with the thundering power and lightning

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:59,000
quick response it's a fitting trophy for

00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,790
your own garage notice the language

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,150
diction syntax in this one so let's

00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:09,420
compare this let's compare that to this

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:11,280
West Virgina blog I wish I could count

00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,430
the times I heard Mama's voice holler

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,080
and my name whilst I was sitting there

00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,760
surrounded by friends cool air and the

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,720
ghost of the future I knew nothing about

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,560
and didn't care

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,980
totally different in language in this so

00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,660
Alisa

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,270
compared this to this National

00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,100
Geographic site for kids it uses an

00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,770
educational style with a grammar and

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,240
diction suitable for kids

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,270
check out this description of Georgia

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,550
trees some trees you're likely to see

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,650
include live oak trees magnolias

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,320
cottonwoods sugar maples and gum trees

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:49,020
but what's that spooky-looking mine all

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,790
over them it's Spanish moss and it

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,280
depends on trees for its water and

00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,170
nutrients it doesn't kill the tree but

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,250
the moss can shade the tree's leaves and

00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:00,690
can sometimes break

00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:03,540
branches off your brand should use a

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,840
consistent diction grammar and style

00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:10,310
which resonates with your audience and

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,310
helps them identify with your brand

00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:16,860
let's look at one more distinguishing

00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:19,070
mark of our content voice voice is the

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,590
mechanics of how we speak

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,390
tambour volume language accent for those

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,430
with podcast voices part of the

00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,370
recording process it's how you

00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:32,810
distinguish between the speakers so how

00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:37,170
does voice apply to written content and

00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:39,710
glad you asked let's visit my blog

00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:43,140
example one more time to highlight voice

00:29:39,710 --> 00:30:17,970
because this is coming so listen to this

00:29:43,140 --> 00:30:21,450
let's listen to this notice that the

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:24,810
words were the same but when delivered

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:28,140
by a different voice it brought life to

00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:31,800
the content you're probably all familiar

00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,630
with HTML in the text-to-speech world

00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,740
the new set of tags that are available

00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:39,570
are called SS ml speech synthetic markup

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,520
language these additional markups can be

00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:45,210
used to help turn written content into

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,940
audio content what you heard was read by

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:54,240
an Amazon Alexa speaker and here's the

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:56,940
HTML that was behind that with the

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,970
additional SS ml tags inserted notice

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:05,880
the voice we changed a Raveena and here

00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:08,100
we changed a Brian so now this is only

00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,900
available on the Amazon Alexa smart

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,350
speakers right now but it's

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:17,580
the point is that this idea of moving to

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:22,110
Boise you can specify a number of things

00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,610
in your text that visually you're not

00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,980
going to see but when it gets turned

00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:40,380
into audio it makes it so that it will

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:42,720
come alive so there it not your your

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,320
your question is a complicated one let's

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,910
put it that way

00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:49,380
so so there's a there's an aspect to it

00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,550
not to be able to put that stuff in like

00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:59,010
this you would have to hand code that

00:31:50,550 --> 00:32:00,600
right now so Google so in the stuff that

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,270
we do we strip those things out because

00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:06,450
Google gets stripped hung up on them and

00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:08,790
actually reads bracket voice name equals

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:12,559
Ravena so it meant so we stripped that

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:21,900
stuff out when when we sent it to Google

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:23,580
so it's very yes but it's coming the

00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,880
point is is it's coming and as our

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,230
audience starts using smart speakers or

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,590
their mobile phone and they start

00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:33,870
talking it's it they're not going to be

00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:36,240
logging into your website and looking at

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,800
stuff as much they're going to be asking

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,110
for what they want and now we're

00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,750
starting to this transition into okay

00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:46,710
how can I set myself up to be able to

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:50,360
give them what they're asking for in a

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,360
way that enhances my brand

00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:04,940
so so those are in Amazon Paulie has a

00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:07,580
set of like 20 some English voices they

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,710
got a bunch of Spanish and French and

00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:15,559
other voices that they put names on to

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:18,260
and so to different people

00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:20,539
yes exactly there's Matthew and Joey and

00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,460
I mean there's a bunch of them and so in

00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:24,260
this one here I just specify this is

00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,970
what you heard you heard Raveena in that

00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,470
first one and then Brian and the second

00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:39,289
one but this is how we we put it in

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:52,610
there so it for Amazon it is right now

00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:55,390
you can do this right now so so SS ml is

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:58,100
a universal standard it's not

00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:02,020
universally supported by all of the

00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:07,850
platforms that turn it into into audio

00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:10,609
yes yes so so yes Google will have this

00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:14,060
they don't yet but it's part of the SS

00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:15,230
ml platform yeah mmm no no that's that's

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,679
that's what we're here for

00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,679
yeah

00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,919
in vocation name yes so it's to be able

00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,250
to do that right now you create a voice

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,800
app that delivers content to somebody

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,890
talking and there's ways of hooking

00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,980
you're building a voice app that you can

00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:46,169
then have it hooked to your RSS feed to

00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,840
be able to deliver your RSS feed so from

00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:51,030
a bloggers perspective you're still

00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,850
blogging you can put these things in and

00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,470
now have your blogs routed through to

00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,030
smart speakers so that they can people

00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,970
can just ask for your blogs and have

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,770
them and hear them or and blogs I'm

00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,300
using blogs generically it's any post

00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:15,420
that you're putting out there content

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:17,640
you're putting out there so this so this

00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,640
is one of our create my voices the

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,520
company I'm from and we so you would

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:28,530
just ask Alexa to start creating my

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,570
voice and well it will get into all of

00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,160
our blog posts and this is one of our

00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,780
blog posts that are out there so we've

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,350
got a number of different examples and

00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:40,320
stuff like that you can do yeah yeah

00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:42,180
yeah yeah and I've get on the last page

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,390
all I've got all the stuff you need

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:51,330
including a link to all these slides so

00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:54,600
yeah okay so let's let's talk about the

00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,980
future of voice technology I got several

00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,140
quotes for you and then we'll get into a

00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,410
few more a little bit more Q&A time if

00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,660
there's any more qnq neh time or any

00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,210
more questions first this quote from Joe

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,130
Murphy CEO of vocal Isaiah at vocalize a

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,320
I we predict that a company branded

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:13,320
voice user interface will soon be a

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,820
must-have feature for almost all mobile

00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,430
phone apps this is a long one but it's

00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:24,060
from Nick Nick Newman for the Reuters

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:26,310
Institute he's talking about voice

00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,090
technology and the impact on the news

00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,520
media

00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:32,040
he says voice remains a critical focus

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,570
for technology platforms platforms

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,090
believe that it will change the way we

00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,040
interact with the Internet and that in

00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,460
turn will disrupt and change the

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,640
business

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,609
models be that ecommerce advertising or

00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,040
Hardwell sales the tech companies vision

00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:49,310
for voice goes way beyond smart speakers

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,410
to become embedded in every device

00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:54,619
supporting and anticipating user needs

00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,910
now you've already heard this where

00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:59,849
they're embedding these things in your

00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:04,140
cars and your refrigerators in your your

00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:05,490
washing machines I heard one in the CES

00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,230
I think where they were talking about a

00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:13,440
company came in and they've got alexa

00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:15,240
embedded in their toilet like now there

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,170
are some things that's like even if you

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,359
can no don't

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:25,380
but I think the exam well I'm not sure

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,380
but the point is is the these in these

00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,900
companies are planning to put these

00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,930
devices everywhere and in everything

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,570
with the idea that they're going to be

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,240
able to respond to you wherever you're

00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,730
at anticipating what your needs are and

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:45,330
being able to give you the answer that

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:48,359
you're looking for without having to go

00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:51,900
to your computer login and pull stuff up

00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:53,520
that's where they're going let's look at

00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,580
this one here Brit armor from Clear

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,770
bridge mobile this is a company that is

00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,200
a software development firm specializing

00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:03,089
in mobile apps voice is the future of

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,050
how brands will interact with their

00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:10,380
customers how about this one for a CEO

00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:12,390
of Blue tag mr. arghhh arhhh all voice

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,580
commerce will completely change the way

00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,470
people shop because it adds a level of

00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,520
ease and personalization to their

00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,520
everyday tasks

00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,500
[Music]

00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:35,390
yes so they're working on that

00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:37,400
so already their embedding the the

00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,640
understanding of who is the person

00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,700
talking to this device so that's already

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,280
happening now it's not great yet but

00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,410
when my wife talks to our Alexa device

00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,110
and I talked to our Alexa device it

00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:53,300
knows the context that it's coming from

00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,890
yeah and that's going to get better and

00:38:53,300 --> 00:39:00,020
better and it will just it will know

00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:02,420
your voice imprint when you talk that's

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,340
where it's going so that's where it's

00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,870
going now a lot right now people are a

00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,450
little uncomfortable with that and so

00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:11,840
you put on there yeah I don't want my

00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:13,460
kids ordering or for me it's my friends

00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,440
coming into my house and getting there

00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,980
before I do and ordering you know six

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,540
cartons of the toilet paper or something

00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,820
like that gonna show up at my doorstep

00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,920
the other so I always have this okay but

00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,230
you got to have these four digits that I

00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,480
don't let anybody know but me so there's

00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,460
ways that they're protecting things but

00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,450
it's coming that's what it is coming

00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,450
yeah

00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,980
it's interested actually it's

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:16,980
interesting the younger generation and

00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,140
the older generation are really moving

00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,990
to these devices that the younger

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:25,440
generations because they sitting in a

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:28,050
computer reading no I don't have time

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,100
for that the older generation I my

00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,490
parents got one

00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,590
and there are 70s they have it on all

00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,380
the time they're always listening to

00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:40,640
stuff and talking to their device and so

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:44,400
it's it's actually in matter of fact

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,840
slight slides sidetrack here they're

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,700
using it for some people like

00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,790
Alzheimer's and stuff like that it's

00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,350
actually a huge benefit for because that

00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,810
some people that they have the same

00:40:52,350 --> 00:41:01,680
question over and over and over again

00:40:54,810 --> 00:41:04,860
and it dries Alexa to the care she'll

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,900
answer that question all day so so

00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:11,690
they're finding these devices of huge

00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,950
benefits in certain cases because they

00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,630
because there's there's huge benefits in

00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,940
those in those environments because it

00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:23,190
can understand the person and respond to

00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:25,020
the person okay I think I got one more

00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,180
here okay so for those of you who

00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,130
followed Gary Vee you know that he sees

00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,710
voice technology disrupting many

00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,300
industries in his interview with Annie

00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,880
sewer the editor-in-chief of Yahoo

00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,670
Finance he says everybody is going to do

00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,030
a lot more things with Alexa Google home

00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:45,030
and Apple pod than they think today like

00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:47,580
order every single food they eat I think

00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:50,070
it's clear voice technology is here and

00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:54,000
it's becoming a new platform to engage

00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:57,530
your audience so that wraps it up any

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,530
