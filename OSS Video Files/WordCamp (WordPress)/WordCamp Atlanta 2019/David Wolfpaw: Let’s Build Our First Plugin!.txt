Title: David Wolfpaw: Let’s Build Our First Plugin!
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	If you’ve ever wanted to build your own plugin for WordPress, this is the session for you. We’re going to start from scratch and work our way up.
First, we’ll take a look at the basic requirements of a plugin. Next we’ll take our example plugin idea and break it into the various components and steps that we’ll need. We’ll code up the plugin together and install it on our sites, debugging any problems that arise. Finally, we’ll look at ways that we could further extend our plugin.
This tutorial assumes some HTML and CSS knowledge, but you don’t already need to be familiar with writing PHP or JavaScript.

thank you wait till the end to decide

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,450
you know if I deserve it or not if

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,490
anyone is interested in WordCamp Orlando

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,610
since just mentioned it it is coming up

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,500
August 23rd through 25th if this is your

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,869
first Ward camp it's kind of similar to

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,810
this only in a place that's a little bit

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,080
more humid that's a lot of fun I really

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,720
enjoy doing that you mentioned if you

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,609
want to follow along with the code it is

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,140
at that short link there it'll take you

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,630
to a github page which I'll be

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,149
referencing a few times I also tweeted

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,879
out the link to it before we get started

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,850
just a few quick things

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,379
I run a maintenance company I handle

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,390
ongoing wordpress support and

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,030
maintenance for my clients I've been

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,649
doing that for the past four years or so

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,800
I've been doing WordPress development

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,270
for about 11 years now I really enjoy it

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,930
and I really enjoy building new themes

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,879
and plugins and I really love teaching

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,699
people things so when I do maintenance

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,559
with my clients I'd spend a lot of time

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,970
telling them what I'm doing you know

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,220
here's what we need to do on your site

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,070
and here's why

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,850
and honestly I really love giving

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,979
presentations and doing the Meetup

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,600
because anything I learn I've learned

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,360
through someone else either going to an

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,000
in-person event or reading a blog post

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,759
and I really want to thank SiteGround

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,170
they are one the sponsors of the event

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,430
I'm one of their WordPress ambassadors

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,840
there's actually a few of us here this

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,150
weekend

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,790
they helped financially support me being

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,590
able to travel to multiple word camps to

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,450
give presentations

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,430
they've there been my host for several

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,380
years I'm not just getting paid to say

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:45,270
this actually really really love their

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,850
stuff so again I'm going to leave that

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,799
up for just moment there's the links and

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,570
there's also a platform that was started

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,840
earlier this year at WordCamp Miami

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:59,969
called my talk rocks if you go to the

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,670
website my talk rocks at any point it

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,890
just takes you directly to a forum where

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,360
you can share information about speakers

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,550
so if you have any interest in sharing

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,649
information we first use this a word

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,390
camp Miami earlier this year and I got

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,890
more feedback on a presentation and like

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,020
all the other Ford camps we've ever gone

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,370
to it's actually cool it looks a lot

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,800
nicer on your phone or you can just

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,710
choose you know speaker and just share

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,790
some of my booties or comments if anyone

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:31,080
sees that I'd appreciate it has anyone

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:34,510
here ever built a plug-in before for

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,230
okay cool good then most of you are in

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,470
the right room

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,790
although might no that's okay so what

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,230
we're going to go over what we're gonna

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,250
build is a notification bar plugin

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,340
basically it's going to be a little bar

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,959
that will show up on the right now I

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,410
have it showing up at the bottom of this

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,790
website here just with some text imagine

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,959
when you want to have like something

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,580
sticking to the top of your website

00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,040
that's you know sign up for my

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,570
newsletter or we have a new product for

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,070
sale or pretty much any information you

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,330
want to quickly share with people on any

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:09,580
page so it's a straightforward small

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,430
project that we can build over the next

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,020
40 minutes but it also showcases a lot

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,310
of things that you can do in WordPress

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,989
and a lot of a little a lot of WordPress

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,870
api's and options that are available to

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:27,730
you so to follow along with this I don't

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:30,610
expect any PHP knowledge but some HTML

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:33,430
and CSS knowledge would be good just you

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,959
know have a baseline that said all of

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,690
the code that we're gonna do I'm going

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,940
to be stepping through line by line as

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:44,170
we work so last time before I take it

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,610
off if anyone wants to follow along with

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:58,720
the code OBM dot io / for camp Atlanta

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:59,470
Twain WC ATL all right and just for the

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,870
moment I'm just gonna be stepping

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,420
through the code here so the first thing

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:10,269
that we're gonna be doing is we have to

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:12,400
create loops just close these for now we

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,799
have to create our plugin file so

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,500
WordPress when it when you're building a

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,640
plugin wordpress plugins go into a

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,870
folder in WP content if you've never

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,150
looked at the files for your wordpress

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,100
site all wordpress sites have a bunch of

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,300
WP / can

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,900
Figg / active PHP files and then they

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,920
have these folders WP admin WP content

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,080
and WP includes is this difficult for

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,980
anyone to read before we move on but the

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,560
text is larger in the wp-content folder

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,880
there is a folder for plugins and in

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,500
that folder we're gonna create our own

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,900
folder only rules are lowercase no

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,590
spaces you know keep special characters

00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,140
to a minimum

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,560
most plugins just to use lowercase name

00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,150
with hyphens so the plug-in that we are

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,230
building I created a folder for it and

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,790
then I'm creating one new file and I'm

00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:14,320
going to title that file it can be

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:17,440
whatever you want to call it dot PHP in

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,920
this case the standards are to title

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,140
this initial file the same name as the

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,490
folder that it's in because that's where

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,360
for wordpress is going to look for it

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,730
first so so far I've created a file a

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,030
PHP file and the only thing in it is a

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,570
comment so that grayed out text is a PHP

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:40,930
comment and the information that I

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,150
placed is the plug-in name the URL where

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,210
you can get the plug-in a description of

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,160
it a version number the author is your

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,170
wordpress.org - username if you plan on

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,490
putting it on the WordPress repo so that

00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,430
it can link to your profile page and

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,970
then if you have a separate URL for the

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,980
author so there's a bunch of other

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,780
conditional tags that you can place here

00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,830
there's an excellent resource that I'll

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,630
be sharing with you at the end for

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,010
WordPress plug-in development but these

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,470
are the main ones that I want to show

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,760
you where they show up on the site so I

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,940
have this first file that we've created

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:16,300
and I'm going to go to my plugins page

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,110
for my website and yes I did use this

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,230
for Miami so apologies for everything we

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,560
m.i.a

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:26,830
so all this plug-in does right now is it

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,340
creates this plug-in activation bar that

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,960
has the name of the plugin the

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,550
description that we created my WordPress

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,180
static username linking to my profile

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,890
and then my website with a link to

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,139
business website so we have a working

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,999
plugin right now

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:53,310
now it does nothing at all because oh

00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:54,960
yes yes the plug-in activation page here

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,539
is pop all the content there is

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,759
populated by WordPress looking in WP

00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,400
content / plugins and then it looks into

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,150
each directory in there you can have a

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,129
plug-in for instance I didn't leave it

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,569
installed here but by default WordPress

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,969
comes with a plug-in called Hello Dolly

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:13,740
and that just happens to be one PHP file

00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:15,389
directly in the plugins folder you could

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,439
do that but most plugins you're gonna

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,509
build you're probably gonna have more

00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,620
than one file so you know you're gonna

00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:23,939
have images CSS JavaScript so we're

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,729
gonna put it in a folder so that we can

00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,409
put all those files in there so right

00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:32,550
now I have this plug-in that I can

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:34,949
activate and like I said it does nothing

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,009
it's active on the site but really it

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:45,839
was just a comment placeholder so now we

00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:47,310
have the next steps alright so first

00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,139
thing I want to do is this plug-in needs

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,050
some settings right we know that we need

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,360
to apply some text and then I'm going to

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,639
put two separate settings to it whether

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,889
you want the bar to play that sorry

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,990
display at the top or bottom of the site

00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,779
and whether you want that bar can be

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:11,699
sticky or not so I'm gonna create a

00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:13,020
settings page and so I'm just one more

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,219
time is this for the people in the bad

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,949
can you read that text or should I

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:19,740
increase the font okay so can all fit on

00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,389
one page so WordPress has a lot of PHP

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,899
functions built in that can help you

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,919
create for create your plugin one thing

00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,620
that we're gonna be using quite heavily

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,779
is WordPress hooks so WordPress has

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,029
something built into it called action

00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:36,240
and filter hooks that allow you to take

00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:39,300
the flow of code and stop it to run your

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,519
own code so an example is there's one

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,289
called WP head there's something called

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,600
WP footer if you've ever looked at your

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,970
theme files you might have seen those in

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,390
there basically it says when you get to

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,260
WP head look for any actions that exist

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,840
that hook into WP

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,810
head and then add this new function to

00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,980
it so in this case I'm using a built in

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:05,370
wordpress hook admin menu and i'm adding

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,500
a new action to it

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,320
the wmds wordpress notification bar I'm

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,910
adding a function notice that the

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,700
function that I had below is the same

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:20,230
name as the action that I put on line 14

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,440
so I'm writing my own PHP function here

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,970
wnb general settings page and the only

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,820
thing that this function does is it uses

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:32,290
a built in WordPress function called add

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,570
submenu page and so everybody guess by

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,760
the name WordPress will take the

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,660
information put here to build a submenu

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,770
page in your WordPress dashboard as I

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,870
mentioned they'll be a list of resources

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,060
at the end one of them the developer

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,520
handbook has a very long and detailed

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,400
list of a lot of the hooks and actions

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,660
and filters built into WordPress

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,370
additionally your own plugin can create

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,860
new ones plugins that you might use

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,200
frequently WooCommerce being a good

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,000
example that has hundreds of its own

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,680
hooks and filters built in so that you

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,520
can take what someone else wrote and

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,290
make your own changes to it

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,910
so in this adds up many page I'm

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:17,980
actually sorry I'm going to use this as

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:22,410
an opportunity to we're trying to

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,410
remember the wordpress.org Oh

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,009
I honestly don't remember the URL to the

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,930
page developer dot wordpress.org on

00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:35,870
developers so there's website developer

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,850
that wordpress.org where all of the

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,730
functions hooks filters and actions

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,329
built into WordPress can be found so the

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:48,769
one I'm using adds sub mini page I can

00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:51,889
see what are what is required of it what

00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:54,680
it should be and what it does so there

00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:57,350
is something called a parent slug we can

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,360
see that that is a required string so

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,100
basically I need to pass some text to

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,839
that and I have to do it for this

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,709
function to work but then there will be

00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,120
ones like a callable function that is

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,790
optional I don't actually have to pass

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,839
that one to use it so I know that to use

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:18,410
add sub mini page I need to pass the

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,600
slug URL of the parent menu item what

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,300
the title of that page will be what the

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,779
menu title will be who should have

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:31,279
access to it and then a menu slug an ID

00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:33,709
that we can use to reference it later to

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,569
show you what that means so on line 17 I

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:42,410
know I want it to go into the general

00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:45,620
settings menu that is this menu item at

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,699
the bottom settings so I'm using the

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,639
page of that options general that PHP

00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:54,319
you can find that for any of these pages

00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:57,560
when you click on them you'll see the

00:11:54,319 --> 00:12:00,949
URL will go to you know whatever URL

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,459
that you wanna use I'm calling this the

00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:06,040
WC amaya notifications bar the menu item

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:08,420
is just going to be notifications bar

00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,930
people who have the ability to manage

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,579
options on the site that's just outside

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,899
since we're gonna be making some option

00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:19,069
changes those are who should be able to

00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:22,399
actually access this menu and then this

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:23,810
is here yet but we have a our sorry this

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,000
isn't here yet but we're going to use a

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,380
function to make that settings page for

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,510
us so when I take this code and save it

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:36,709
and refresh that page so just right now

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,040
I'm hovering over the settings page and

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,600
you can see the general setting

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,779
options that are built into wordpress

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,730
now when i refresh the page and hover

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:48,480
over it again we now have a new page

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:50,880
called notifications bar the page that

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,339
we just created but you might be to

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,600
guess when I click on it I think it's

00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,490
gonna happen we're actually gonna get an

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,959
error because I told it here's the

00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,759
function that displays what's going to

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,949
happen on this page and we haven't yet

00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,310
written that function so that's gonna be

00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,310
our next step

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,860
additionally before I move on you'll

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,199
notice that some of the lines of code

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,019
that I write are going to be enclosed in

00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:13,709
parenthesis and they're going to have

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,920
underscores in front of them to

00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:19,139
underscores or underscore e those are to

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,870
make the whatever text you have in there

00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,069
translatable so we could localize it for

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,279
a different language or different

00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:28,380
dialect so in this case I have the text

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,649
that's gonna be the title that page and

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,990
then the second piece of text there is

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:36,180
the slug that identifies what our

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,709
translation is going to be so now if I

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,209
put this plug-in out for other people to

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,690
use and they want to translate it into

00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:43,620
Spanish say they have an easy way to

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,180
translate all the individual bits of

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,449
text without actually changing the code

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,949
of the plug-in it's something that you

00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:51,600
know you'll up take time to start

00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:53,639
learning how to use this and remember to

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,649
put it for things but if you start

00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,389
releasing code publicly it'll be a big

00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,990
help to get more people to use your

00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,250
plug-in all right so we've created that

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:08,370
menu page now let's start creating

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:11,190
things on that page so I mentioned that

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,889
we have a callback function here and our

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,029
ad sub mini page basically it says here

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:19,589
is the function that starts building

00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:23,120
that page and that is the same name as

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:25,350
that function that I'm writing here

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:31,459
inside of there I'm writing some HTML

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:33,300
code that is making a page wrapper the

00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:36,660
title of the page we're going to put

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:39,300
here and then I'm creating a form the

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,730
form is going to be a post form that

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,639
goes to options at PHP so when I save

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:48,120
this form it'll refresh this page bring

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,889
me back here and I'm doing two things

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm getting whatever settings field I

00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,600
have set for this page

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,150
and then I am telling it to do those

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,980
settings and then a building a submit

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,690
button these are all functions that are

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,070
built into WordPress so you're not going

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,560
to have to worry about creating

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,210
everything on forms yourself you can use

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,100
these tools that will handle what this

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,110
handles for you is when you create your

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,320
form fields your text areas your radio

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,610
buttons checkboxes it's gonna handle

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,410
saving them to your database for you

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,660
calling the information from the

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,030
database so that it shows up on the page

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,010
when you refresh calling the information

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,720
wherever else you tell it to call it so

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,670
that you know whatever settings we make

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,200
here we can use on the site so we don't

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:32,730
have to write all the logic to do that

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:35,250
WordPress will handle that for us all

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,870
right so we have that extra code that's

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,120
going to start displaying this page I'm

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,300
gonna refresh it and as is going to be

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,350
common during this demonstration it

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,360
looks a little bit better but there's

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:52,380
still nothing going on if we haven't

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:56,610
created any of those fields yet so let's

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:58,620
start that next so I know that to start

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,680
with I'm gonna add two fields I'm going

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,020
to add a text box or @ sorry an input

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,120
box so that we can write some text to go

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,490
on to that notification bar and then I'm

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,900
going to create a radio button to just

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,640
choose whether it's going to display at

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,810
the top of the page or the bottom I'm

00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,070
going to create another radio button

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,700
later but for now I want to show you how

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:20,520
these to work I'm using another built in

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,310
WordPress hook admin in it this just

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,440
means when the admin side of the site

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,680
loads so whenever we're on a dashboard

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,120
page it's going to look for any any

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,080
functions that we have hooked to that

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,920
and run the code so we have our function

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,380
WM be initialized settings and in that

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,320
function I have added a setting section

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,350
a settings field and another settings

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,820
field for the options and then I've told

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,370
it to register those so I'm gonna walk

00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,560
through these in a moment but again

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,590
creating these inputs a lot of that

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,050
WordPress handles the logic for you so

00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,220
we are writing some PHP code but the

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:03,810
majority of it is built in WordPress

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:10,829
functions that we can easily go to the

00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:13,290
WordPress developer page and see exactly

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,730
what it's looking for to build it so

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,620
there's not quite so much guesswork you

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,140
know you don't have to figure out where

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,350
you're starting each a bit of code

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,730
WordPress

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,740
you know handles that problem all the

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,430
time creating settings pages for plugins

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,319
so you can save having to write all the

00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,730
code yourself and using things that

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,730
WordPress already has built in to do it

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,450
so on refresh the page and show you that

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:42,420
again it's broken which is at the moment

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:45,270
expected and I'm going to pull this up

00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,790
and say that we've created a settings

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,380
section our general settings this is

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,640
just all the settings are gonna fall

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:56,550
under this section our two fields

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,260
notification text and the display

00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,940
location and then all the options for

00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,200
them I have time to go through all the

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,810
individuals but if they say all the

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,600
options you know radio buttons and then

00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,680
we're registering those I'm saying that

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,620
I want to register those general

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:15,780
settings to this plugins general

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:18,150
settings section so why is it when i

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:26,970
refresh the page I am getting errors

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:28,670
here anyone have an idea that similar to

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,810
the other things that I've written I

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,700
started writing something and said use

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,900
this piece of code but we haven't yet

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,500
written the piece of code that were

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,500
referencing

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,670
so the next thing we have to do is well

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:51,190
next thing we have to do is actually

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:52,480
create create those inputs that we're

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,030
going to use so I mentioned that

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,550
WordPress handles the logic of those for

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,940
us but we're still going to create our

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:04,230
input our input types here so the first

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:07,000
one I'm using is a text input callback

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,400
basically I want to say whenever I want

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,650
to make a text box use this bit of code

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,030
and then a radio input callback whenever

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,320
you want to create radio buttons and

00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,300
these are all going to I'm doing with

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,760
this plug-in you can create some for

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,500
color pickers drop-down select pretty

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,830
much any sort of form field that exists

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,690
WordPress has some code to handle it for

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,120
now I think two is good for

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:31,120
demonstration so I'm saying that I want

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,730
to create an input that has some

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,100
specific info from our settings the ID

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,990
of the option that we've created the

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,420
name and then whatever value we want to

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,820
call back so that we can see it when we

00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,840
refresh the page same for the radio

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,070
buttons this allows you to modify it so

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,750
if you want them to display a certain

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:54,280
way if you want to pull different

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,920
information from them or have them

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,660
function differently in this case it's

00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,370
just a bit of PHP code that I wrote to

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,770
say I want to display them in a certain

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,340
way well your fresh the page we'll see

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:09,280
what that looks like which is the title

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:13,420
of that area and then whatever input

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,010
we're trying to call so and I happen to

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,930
I played with this morning so I have the

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,910
settings safe so by the way by

00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,950
deactivating the plug-in the settings

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,600
that I created such as the text and a

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,350
where I want it displayed are still

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,270
saved in the WordPress database so since

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,980
this is not a fresh install this plug-in

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,450
it's pulling those same settings that I

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,770
already have from the database which is

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,840
also good where you know if you

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,910
accidentally delete or uninstall plug-in

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,680
or just deactivate it and need to

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,570
reactivate it the settings that you have

00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,080
for it are still saved on your site you

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:47,800
have to worry about them disappearing so

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,290
we've created two inputs a text input

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,700
where we put whatever text we want just

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,200
writing this is a developer workshop and

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,760
then choose

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,830
where we want the notification bar to

00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,179
display I gave three options of don't

00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,549
display it displayed on the top of the

00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:07,210
site display on the bottom that's great

00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:09,159
I can save it I can change the text and

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,080
when I save it it'll refresh the page

00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,990
but the text that I added is still there

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,700
because now it's updated in the database

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,299
but as you can probably guess when I go

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:23,500
to the front end the site and refresh

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:25,179
there's nothing showing up next thing we

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,100
have to do now that we've created that

00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:29,019
settings page created all of our inputs

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,880
and made sure that they will save to the

00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:32,860
database next thing we have to do is

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,220
actually make use of that data that

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:40,889
we've created so the first thing I'm

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:44,519
going to do is create a new function

00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:46,539
called wnb display notification bar

00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,490
again this can be whatever we want to

00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,809
call it as long as that function is the

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,870
same as the callback that we're using

00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,820
which is line 149 this add action and

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,909
I'm saying that in the footer of the

00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,250
site I want you to run this function and

00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:02,320
what the function is doing is first

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,130
seeing if there are any settings saved

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,000
for that plug-in so this is the same

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,909
slug that we used when we're creating

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,950
the settings and I just say if it's not

00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:15,179
no so if there are some settings saved

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:18,039
then get those options from the database

00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:19,809
we're using a built-in function get

00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,220
option which will just grab everything

00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:22,450
from the database so again you don't

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,360
need to worry about writing your own

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,559
sequel queries you can just write use

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,559
this function that will grab everything

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:33,610
for you and then I'm using a little bit

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,769
of HTML to display that that box in this

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:40,269
case it's just going to be a black bar

00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:43,750
with white text on it rather it will be

00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:46,029
a black box with white text on it and

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,870
I'm just telling it to put this display

00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:52,059
location as a class of that box and so I

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,019
can use CSS to choose where it goes and

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:58,510
then put whatever text we have saved so

00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:01,149
this make sense if you have any

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,690
questions feel free to jump in so when

00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:06,190
we have this I go the front of the site

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,180
by there's just a default you know

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,360
installed with the 29

00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:14,310
theme and when i refresh i'm going to

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:18,010
scroll down to the footer and see that

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:22,540
that i have text there you go but well

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:25,060
it's there it says replace lamp so you

00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,230
know that's back illiterate right anyway

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,020
we have some text there behind the

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:33,130
projector or a screen but it isn't

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:38,590
styled or anything yet so next thing

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:41,730
we're gonna do is create a style sheet

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,230
for our plugin and load it to the site

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,490
WordPress as I'll keep repeating over

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,700
and over again has a built in function

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:51,520
for this there's a function called WP in

00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:55,750
cue scripts are there so sorry a hook

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,910
that you can use to add any scripts or

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,670
styles to your website so any JavaScript

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,140
or CSS that you need add so when we get

00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:05,950
to that point we're gonna be loading

00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:09,280
this script sorry the style sheet I give

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:11,050
a name and ID to the style sheet I'm

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,330
telling it where to find that style

00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,400
sheet so in this case I'm saying look

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:20,200
for this file in the plug-in directory

00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,280
and then look for this other file in a

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,970
relation to the file that we're

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,860
currently in you can then pass an array

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,260
of dependencies basically I can say

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,910
don't load this file until these other

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,170
files have already loaded so if you're

00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,390
writing a plug-in that you're say you're

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,830
using jQuery to you know do some

00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,900
functionality for the site you might

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,730
want to have a dependency of jQuery so

00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,760
it only loads after that's loaded and

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,350
then you can pass a version number to it

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,060
that way if you update your plug-in you

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,830
can update that version number and make

00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,490
sure that the new file gets loaded if

00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:53,710
someone has a cash off or something and

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:56,770
we've actually created that file the

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:59,320
notifications dot CSS file not going to

00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:02,910
go into this in great detail but created

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,530
a box that's black white text on it and

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:09,040
added classes for whether it's chosen to

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:14,010
display on top or bottom of the site and

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,010
then a little bit for smaller screens

00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:20,100
all right so we have that created we

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:22,470
have our text down there and I'm gonna

00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,780
refresh the page there we go to style a

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,400
little bit better now of course you can

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,929
use you know CSS to style this whatever

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,179
way you want we can actually have

00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,250
settings on our page to let someone

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:36,240
choose what color the text or box is

00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:38,700
going to be you can have easily readable

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,440
classes so that's somebody who's using

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,390
your plug-in later can style things in

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,070
their own way so we have it on the

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,409
bottom the page now I can go here and

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:49,590
say display on the top of the page save

00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:54,240
those changes we refresh now we see it's

00:25:49,590 --> 00:26:05,850
up there at the top alright so everyone

00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:08,340
following along so far yes good question

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:10,770
so the function I wrote uses the hook WP

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,280
footer but this is displaying on the top

00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,380
of the page

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,020
not the footer so the reason I use WP

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,020
footer is when you you just pull it up

00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:25,919
so I'm going to and by the way if we've

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,590
not seen before this is the browser

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,419
debugger I use it all day to like a look

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,940
at the CSS and JavaScript and HTML

00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:36,929
running on the site you can get to it in

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:39,299
pretty much any browser by right

00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:42,090
clicking and clicking inspect or inspect

00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:44,150
element what some use to pull this up so

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,710
I'm looking at that bit of code there

00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,830
that's the HTML that I wrote to display

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:52,830
this box and we do see that it is still

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,900
loading after all of these other page

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,289
elements so it is loading in the footer

00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,590
of the site however I use some CSS to

00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:04,020
just say when we have display top I just

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,330
hold it - absolutely position that box

00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,909
at the top of the page you know this is

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,289
a very it's very straightforward it

00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:11,600
doesn't account for things like sticky

00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:13,890
headers or things like that

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,360
so that this is not gonna look perfect

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,520
like if you just install on all of your

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,620
sites but we can make some changes to

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,570
make it look better depending on the

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,970
site so yes even though the code is

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,970
loading in the footer of the site

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:35,909
using CSS we can move it around on the

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:38,669
site alright so I decided that I wanted

00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:41,909
to make it so that you didn't just have

00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:43,559
to you know go to the top bottom of the

00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:46,019
site to see that but we can make it

00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,080
stuck in one place so I added a new

00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,370
option to make it sticky I had to make

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:56,399
the notification bar sticky or don't

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:58,529
make it sticky now I already have this

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,419
radio call back so you know I can make

00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:03,720
it easier a do buttons so all I had to

00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:06,090
do this time was add a new settings

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,490
field so I already had the one for the

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:11,669
display location I just took that code

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,470
copy and pasted it and just changed the

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:15,120
options and again this is where using

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,980
those things built into WordPress comes

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,230
in handy it makes it a lot quicker to

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,779
just add new fields I already have how I

00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,340
want radio buttons to display so now I

00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,649
just need to change the text you know

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,629
will this be sticky

00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:30,360
it's a radio button and it goes in the

00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:31,679
general settings section and my options

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,799
are make it sticky or don't make it

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,470
sticky I have these IDs that we're using

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,129
here sticky or relative to actually make

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,080
the new styles that we're gonna use and

00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:46,860
if we go here I added two new styles to

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,960
choose whether it is fixed position at

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:53,789
the top of the page or sticky position

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,990
at the bottom CSS positioning and so if

00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:56,700
I choose to make the notification bar

00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,690
sticky I'm just gonna scroll down a bit

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:03,120
first save that setting so now if i

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,309
refresh the page we'll see that it's

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:10,200
going to stick to wherever I'm at and

00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:12,330
the same thing if we chose the bottom so

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,820
again the idea is that I didn't have

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,679
this in mind when I started writing the

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,110
plug-in and then later I said oh I want

00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,909
to add this new feature to it um again

00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,289
if I say oh I want to add letting

00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:24,059
someone put in the color they want to

00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,500
use for the text or something you can

00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,690
still do that on top of the existing

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,019
plugin just by adding a new settings

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:33,659
field all of these things use what's

00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:36,990
called the WordPress settings API the

00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:38,640
WordPress developer handbook has a lot

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,410
of information about that

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,890
but the idea is that there are a few

00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,480
built-in plug few built-in functions

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:48,210
that can handle a lot of the work for

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,920
you I want to stress that every time I

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,600
go through is that a lot of these things

00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,700
are things that WordPress already does

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,040
so you know you have to come up with the

00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,010
idea you have to start writing some of

00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,840
the HTML and CSS to structure things the

00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:03,120
way you want but when you start writing

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,370
the code WordPress does a lot to help

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,530
you get started yeah you shouldn't have

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,630
to say reinvent how to make a call to

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:13,830
the database to get options WordPress

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:15,480
will handle that for you that also means

00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:22,890
that you can write a whole plugin like

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:24,570
this within one workshop okay all right

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,990
well actually I have one more thing to

00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,910
go over so I decided that okay I have

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:34,530
the settings page which is cool and all

00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:36,300
but who who here's use the customizer in

00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,710
WordPress or if you know what the

00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,390
customizer is if you were on the front

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,550
end of your site and you're logged in

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,710
you click customize or around the back

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,350
end and hover over that and click

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:49,380
customize there is this section I should

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,170
have I should I should have shown you

00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,430
this before I fresh but well there's a

00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,080
section here that has a lot of things

00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,180
built into WordPress and your own

00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,850
plug-in our themes can add things to

00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,440
this customizer so I added the code

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,380
before i refresh the page here so

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,260
apologies but I added a bit of code that

00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,940
will create our own section here so site

00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,140
identity color as many as those things

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,600
are all built into WordPress in the

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,570
customizer I created a new one called

00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,910
notification bar and when we click into

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,490
that settings page we have the same

00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,680
options that we created choosing where

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,020
to display it if it's gonna be sticky or

00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,780
not and then whatever text we want to

00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,490
put so I'm gonna try this again but I'm

00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,280
going to type something new now and

00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:35,310
what's going oh I'm gonna tell it

00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,080
display on the top of the page and so

00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:40,820
you can take a look and watch while I'm

00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,820
while I'm typing the text up here

00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:49,140
Oh Oh floor and then I can make those

00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:51,920
changes like right now it's sticky I can

00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:55,110
say put it on the bottom of the site and

00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,280
see live you know what we're doing and

00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,170
that's one reason why you might want to

00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,670
use the customizer so you can see what

00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,340
you're doing while you're working on it

00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,810
so this is an alternative to building

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:13,830
that settings page that we originally

00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:17,070
wrote the code to do that I'm just

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:20,280
scrolling down oh here we are alright

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:22,320
the code to move to the customizer is

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,380
going to be different than the code that

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,600
we need for that settings page where I'm

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,930
using again built into WordPress they

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,630
have functions for the customizer to

00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,460
create those customizer sections

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:38,580
settings set of inputs they're called

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,130
controls so I did have to write new code

00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,650
to make it do that but the code is

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:47,210
fairly similar to the settings API code

00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:50,490
and that's on purpose that we wrote I

00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:53,040
still get to display the choices my

00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:55,230
radio buttons put the same text the same

00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,060
options I use the exact same option

00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:58,980
names that I used in the settings page

00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,290
so you don't need to change any other

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,870
code I don't need to change the CSS or

00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:06,150
how it displays or anything because I'm

00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,820
using the same names and the customizer

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:12,570
I just said put it on this page instead

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,920
of putting it on that other page there's

00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:18,500
a few cool things with the customizer

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,500
such as they find one

00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,929
by default unless you tell it not to by

00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,760
default everything on that page is gonna

00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:32,409
Auto refresh so again I can start typing

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,929
something without having to refresh the

00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:37,600
page to see you know what it looks like

00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:40,090
I can make these changes and it's going

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,520
to change to CSS that's loading so

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,500
that's really cool and that's again

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,690
sorry keep stressing it but hopefully

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,340
it's a well impress that let WordPress

00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,320
do a lot of the work for you all those

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,750
things are built in the code I rewrote

00:33:50,320 --> 00:34:00,400
didn't have to rewrite the whole plugin

00:33:52,750 --> 00:34:02,830
just the settings portion yeah yes yes

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,750
so there is there's an additional CSS

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,640
thing built into WordPress but we could

00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,679
put a section here that you know instead

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:21,849
of this being a text area has a CSS

00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:23,830
specific area for our plug-in yes the

00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:25,869
question was why the text wasn't already

00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:29,550
there if I was using the same settings

00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:32,440
from the from the from the settings page

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,530
the answer is I'm actually using a

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,050
different options set up so before the

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:42,070
code was written as just an array of

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:43,570
options in the database basically all of

00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,919
the settings that I wrote it would make

00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:50,679
one call to the database that would go

00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:53,379
find a specific a specific slug sorry

00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,419
I'm playing a specific ID in the

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:57,849
database for all the settings we had it

00:34:55,419 --> 00:35:00,400
does switch to a new in the database it

00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:02,290
does switch to a new setting section but

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,150
the since I'm using the same names for

00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,040
everything that I used to call other

00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:08,020
places in the plug-in like where it

00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,550
actually displays on the front-end I

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,700
didn't have to change that part of the

00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,700
code

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,200
yes so there actually are before yes so

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,910
when it was just a settings page there

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,740
was one line in the database that was

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,150
for this plugin and now there is a

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,270
second line in the database for this

00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:27,040
plugin and it's well since I didn't

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:30,790
delete the other code is using both but

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,930
it's using one or the other and that's

00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,760
just because of how I originally

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,470
structured it and then I said okay I'm

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,700
gonna structure this differently so that

00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:40,900
we can enter the data a different way

00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,480
the goal for this oh sorry

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,490
the goal for this was to show that you

00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,170
can do things a variety of ways in

00:35:45,490 --> 00:36:01,990
WordPress and others features built in

00:35:47,170 --> 00:36:03,610
for them yes so the question is if I had

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,230
settings in the settings page and the

00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:09,940
customizer could they conflict with each

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:13,450
other in this case no only because since

00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:16,090
I am now using this code here it's now

00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:17,800
pulling from the customizer code it's

00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,540
not pulling from the settings page code

00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:24,250
anymore

00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,570
and that was so let's see so sorry what

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,270
I meant to impress was we're no longer

00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:30,370
using the code up here that we created

00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:33,630
to create those settings pages we've

00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:36,250
just replaced it with this other code

00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,440
but the but it's still pulling the same

00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,610
things it's pulling the same things from

00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,290
the database but it's pulling them from

00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,290
a different place in the database now

00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,590
yeah

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:56,950
oh yes I just took it out sorry so so I

00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,650
just said here use this instead of using

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:01,060
that I didn't delete the code I want to

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:04,960
leave the code up you know be able to

00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:06,730
look through it but where I said grab

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,589
things from the database I'm saying grab

00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,800
from this line of the database instead

00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:14,550
of this other line from the database and

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:23,470
I could I could pull up the let's see

00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:30,930
both d1 PHP my admin this is a local

00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:30,930
site so that mean called route options

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:45,440
all right so the new settings that we've

00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:47,090
created all of the in all the

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,890
information I've created and a base is

00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,480
stored in one line in the database and

00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:53,060
all of the options that we created the

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,070
text the display location whether it's

00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,750
sticky or not are part of an array in

00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,600
that setting so we're only pulling one

00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,380
option but we're pulling a new one

00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,170
instead of the one we're easing for the

00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:06,410
settings page but what is our what I

00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,970
meant to what I meant to impress funny

00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,090
were without having to rewrite all the

00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,950
code was since I'm still using the same

00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:14,750
option names in the array the places

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,520
that call for notification text or

00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:20,750
display location that bit of code

00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,700
doesn't need a change I wouldn't suggest

00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,460
to writing things both in the settings

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,650
page or the customizer yes that that's

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,720
more for the purposes of this to show

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:44,660
here's two different ways to display

00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:49,400
that information button yes so so for

00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:52,520
instance as we can see we added new code

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,650
and I just said here instead of calling

00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,530
from that one piece of options call from

00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:01,610
this other options area

00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:04,640
oh yes yes and I'll pull that I'll pull

00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:06,560
that back up in a moment and that's why

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,840
the URL again the URL goes to this

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,420
github page and when you're looking at

00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,250
these the commits the changes to the

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,080
code you can actually see exactly what

00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,030
things the red things are deleted green

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,350
things are added so I just said instead

00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:21,200
of calling from this area

00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:23,300
call the option from this other area I

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,030
didn't remove the other code just more

00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,040
for reference in this case additionally

00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:31,130
for reference I mentioned that there are

00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,170
I gave one information on how to use the

00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,640
repository in the event you know you go

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,680
to review it later on remember you want

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,570
to look those commits and there's also a

00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,410
few links to things like the developers

00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:44,420
handbook in here I would definitely

00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,580
recommend looking through that when you

00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,569
want to when you want to start your own

00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,829
plugin

00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:51,109
just to make sure if you have an idea

00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:52,699
that you've already fleshed out you know

00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:54,259
okay I want to do this and I know I'm

00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:56,479
going to need settings here and I know I

00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:58,969
want it to display here and I want it to

00:39:56,479 --> 00:40:00,410
interact with this check to see if some

00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:02,569
of those things already exists

00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:05,989
like for instance I mentioned all these

00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:07,519
action hooks multiple times pretty much

00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,589
everything that I'm done is using an

00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,839
action hook built into WordPress so you

00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:15,259
can go through and see what type of

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:19,519
actions exist how they work like how

00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:21,170
priorities work and where they load it's

00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,199
like knowing that WP footer loads on the

00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:28,269
front end of the site where ever that W

00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:28,269
footer is put in the theme for instance

00:40:28,749 --> 00:40:31,749
yeah

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,749
can you communicate with external

00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:42,339
services so the answer is yes if you

00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:44,920
want to write to communicate with

00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:47,680
something like I'll use ecommerce as an

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:51,009
example like an inter shop they

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,460
integrate with stripe by default and a

00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:56,680
few others I think so you're gonna need

00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,390
to integrate with a third-party payment

00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,609
processing solution so they've written

00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,499
some code that they got from stripe that

00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:04,150
says you know here's how to send a

00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,559
transaction to stripe for when sahn

00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,539
makes the purchase and then they've

00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,519
integrated that with whatever settings

00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:12,249
are on the page on your site so if you

00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,989
go to click you know Add to Cart and

00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:17,589
click purchase on a product on a

00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:20,880
wordpress site the parts of it you know

00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:23,140
adding to your cart saving your info

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,609
sending orders things like that those

00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,249
all happen in WordPress and the plugin

00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:29,380
the actual payment processing they wrote

00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:32,049
code to integrate with whatever payment

00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,940
service like stripe it as an example so

00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:35,859
as long as that third-party service has

00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,180
some way to interact with it you know

00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:42,569
hopefully it has a public API or

00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:42,569
something then you can do that yeah

00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:50,609
is there a standard for adding your

00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,210
plugin to the WordPress directory there

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:55,799
is and you can find that from the

00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,510
wordpress plugin developer handbook

00:41:55,799 --> 00:42:00,359
there's a page called the plug-in

00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,530
directory and it gives a lot of

00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:04,559
information that there are some people

00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:06,930
here from the who work with the

00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,099
WordPress plug-in or points one in here

00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,460
they're probably some people here in the

00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,099
building

00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,559
who do work on getting plugins into the

00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:15,829
repository I have a few up there as well

00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,880
so you know I don't have any questions

00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:19,740
but there are some things like here are

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,220
some requirements for your plugin you

00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:25,290
know it can and can't do these things

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:29,040
and then some step by step on what you

00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:31,170
do the process basically goes with you

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,790
writing the code you submitting it

00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,130
through a form here that they tell you

00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:37,440
how to submit it it gets reviewed for a

00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,059
few different things and then you know

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,770
sent back to you hey this thing needs to

00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,079
be changed or something before it can go

00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,819
up on the repository there's also a

00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,700
whole system for updating your plugins

00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:49,920
WordPress 5.2 comes out probably on

00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,270
Tuesday and I still need update my

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,069
plugins to say that it works with it

00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:57,599
still after testing of course that it

00:42:53,069 --> 00:43:00,809
does the main things that there's

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,750
actually over here there's a the

00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:05,520
detailed plug-in guidelines gives you

00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,410
links to some plugins that you can

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,150
install that can do some of the checks

00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,099
automatically because there's a lot of

00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,750
checks that are done to make sure things

00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:15,480
are translatable make sure that certain

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:20,339
security known security flaws aren't

00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,809
being used there's just a few checks of

00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,309
things that would normally do so you can

00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:25,829
do some of those checks yourself first

00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:28,530
before you submit to save both sides

00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:30,540
some time and the WordPress team is the

00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,000
plug-in repository team is you know

00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,380
really good at being quick getting back

00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,880
to people giving them detailed

00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:40,880
information yeah thank you

00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,620
do you have to have a certain number of

00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,660
users to keep it in the plug-in

00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:59,450
repository you don't actually there are

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:03,260
some plugins that that probably have

00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,820
almost no downloads quite honestly it's

00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,230
not based on certain of our users it's

00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:09,020
as long as it follows whatever other

00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:10,940
guidelines that there are its commercial

00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,000
guidelines security guidelines things

00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,610
like that you know one of my plugins is

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,380
used on a few thousand sites and then I

00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:20,090
have a plug-in that it says under 40

00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,520
sites but the number of sites that are

00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:24,920
using it as like vague like you know 10

00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,780
20 whatever but so I know that not many

00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,420
people are using one of them but

00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,190
apparently some people still are so if

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:38,360
it serves them that's why that is why

00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:40,070
the plug-in repository itself has almost

00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,540
55,000 plugins in it right now and

00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,940
that's after a bunch have been cleaned

00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,530
out a bunch of there are some that get

00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,480
cleaned out for a variety of reasons and

00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:49,970
I know that there's some ideas to make

00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,560
that better but you know the idea is

00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:55,780
keep the code up there as long as it's

00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,780
useful to somebody and then

00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:09,599
yep

00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:23,890
yeah the question is yeah so I'm gonna

00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:25,990
jump back in my code here I think let's

00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:28,390
see alright so the question was what's a

00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:30,700
good way to step through your code to

00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:33,160
debug to debug it or you mean to figure

00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,780
out a problem so just as an example I

00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,640
stepped back in my code just a bit and

00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,390
you know where I had a place where I had

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,800
a known error

00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:41,920
I was calling something that wasn't

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,930
there yet it's not ideal but it's one

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,300
way to start you will see an error on

00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:48,850
here you know here is something that we

00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,650
expect it to happen and we weren't able

00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,390
to find it and then it gives me the

00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,800
exact location that file that's one way

00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,720
to start you know tells you where to

00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,970
look but there's a few other things you

00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,850
can do if we're talking PHP specifically

00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:02,470
which a lot of word presses are in PHP

00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:04,540
there is a tool called X debug that

00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:07,180
works really well it's a way to step

00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:09,310
through the code as it's running so you

00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,770
can step through it you know line by

00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:14,350
line and see what's happening that is

00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:17,730
definitely multiple workshops in its own

00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:20,650
to go into and all the usage of it

00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:22,359
there are some tools that honestly like

00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,580
let's say I'm working on a client site I

00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,720
don't always have the ability to you

00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,790
know get onto the server and install

00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,670
tool like X debug or I don't have the

00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:33,730
time to get really into something there

00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,050
is a plugin that I use called query

00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,480
monitor that actually does a lot of

00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:41,230
things that help debugging quickly on a

00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,270
wordpress site so this plug-in is

00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:45,460
written by a wordpress core contributor

00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:47,170
it's a it appears only for people who

00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,230
are logged in as administrators of the

00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:55,660
site so I'm running query monitor here

00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:57,940
and you'll see this extra information

00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,520
that's loading in my dashboard or my

00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,760
admin bar and I can actually click into

00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,260
it and get more info there's all sorts

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,119
of things that he has in here the newer

00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,680
version of it actually gives you

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,270
information about guttenberg blocks too

00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,190
so you can see what's loading and how

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,890
they're loading but it gives me a way to

00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:18,609
start debugging what queries are made on

00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:21,760
the site any external requests again

00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:22,870
what blocks are running what file

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,240
templates are being you

00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:27,010
so I can make sure that I've had this

00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,260
problem before we're like say I'll be

00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,610
making a WooCommerce template and then

00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,290
I'll be like why is this not loading and

00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,640
then I realized that just like I tried

00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,800
to own a developer's that WordPress calm

00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,560
I typed single products page being set a

00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,790
single product and just some things like

00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,890
this are just little gut checks to make

00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,540
sure that you know I don't spend I've

00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:47,920
spent hours looking at things where I go

00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:51,180
oh yeah I didn't add a - or I added a

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,830
period there in shipping comma happens

00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,480
tools like this makes it easy because I

00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,040
can install this on almost any site and

00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,050
you know again no one else is gonna see

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,200
it but an admin who's logged in this is

00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:06,270
a good way to do some general testing on

00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,270
it okay

00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,750
what is a graceful way to retire a

00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,550
plugin I've not personally dealt with

00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,540
that but I do know that there are some

00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:23,320
things that you can do the wordpress.org

00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,570
repop if you're talk about ones that are

00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,990
in the wordpress.org repository there is

00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:32,110
actually a tag you can put onto it so

00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:36,040
I'm just gonna go back to the I'm just

00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:38,740
I'll choose this and you say that any

00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,180
plug-in that you're looking at have tags

00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,100
that they're related to so I can look at

00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,790
like all block plugins or Gutenberg

00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,870
plugins if anyone here does know the

00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,780
name of it I think it's just called

00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:52,150
adoptable or can adopt or something like

00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:54,340
that there is a tag you can add that

00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:56,050
signals that somebody else could take

00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:59,320
over ownership of that plug-in if they

00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:01,750
wanted I don't remember what the actual

00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,640
tag is offed off my head

00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:06,220
you have always have the ability of

00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,570
contacting the original developer you

00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:13,360
know because there's whatever info

00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:14,650
they've provided to somewhere down here

00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,330
okay they have a lot of stuff there we

00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,620
go at the bottom the contributors and

00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,980
developers you have whatever contact

00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:24,220
info they left so what I would if you

00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,840
want to retire something perhaps make it

00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,120
adoptable so that someone else can take

00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:36,070
over if they want to you know continue

00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:37,510
developing it say okay I'm sure there's

00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:40,180
a method to remove them from the

00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:42,010
WordPress repository but I don't have

00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,050
another one off top of my head there are

00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:46,030
some WordPress core contributors here

00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:50,100
today that can probably walk you through

00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:50,100
that yeah

00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,960
right so I'm sorry

00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,890
yes so the question is just having more

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:27,890
plugins make their site run slower and

00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,760
that is a common conception and I'm not

00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,160
going to say it's a misconception

00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,540
because sometimes that is true you know

00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,190
having more plugins loading on the site

00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,610
will make the site load slower but

00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:40,610
that's not always true my idea is that a

00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:43,270
good plugin does one thing and does that

00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:46,820
one thing well so as an example

00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:48,920
WooCommerce will run I run in a few mu

00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,050
commerce sites and it handles ecommerce

00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,340
portion of the site but pretty much any

00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:56,720
other side thing I want to do like

00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,670
WooCommerce to FedEx you know so it can

00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,700
do that FedEx integration WooCommerce to

00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,900
stripe so I can do my payment processor

00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,850
WooCommerce filtering so you can make

00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,250
custom filtering pages all those things

00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:08,450
would be extensions to commerce plugins

00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,790
that aren't part of that main plug-in

00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:12,110
but that you know add to it so on a

00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:14,420
normal loop commerce site I'm if you're

00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:17,000
running you know a dozen plugins just

00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,980
for WooCommerce and it's a lot but they

00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,860
all do one thing that the site's meant

00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,900
to do and if they're made well as an

00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,510
example let's say a FedEx shipping

00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,130
calculation one it shouldn't be running

00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,810
anywhere besides that shipping page

00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,300
where I'm doing the calculations so if

00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:35,270
somebody writes that plug-in well it

00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:37,460
should be you know should be fine you

00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:39,890
can a plug-in can be written poorly or a

00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,710
buckin can be written in a way that'll

00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:44,720
slow a site down a variety of ways

00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:46,970
poorly optimized code but that one

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,170
honestly isn't a huge problem the bigger

00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,940
problem I see is people trying to

00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,950
optimize their code before they ever

00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:55,700
even start using it so I just mean

00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:58,820
something that you know will say call

00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,680
get me every page on my site to look for

00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,750
this one specific page and find one

00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,070
option I've seen some plugins do that

00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,900
they'll say you know get me way more

00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:10,850
data than I need from the database to

00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:12,620
find one piece of data some plugins are

00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,820
going to make your site run slower just

00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,420
because of the nature of what that

00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:19,220
plug-in is doing an example is things

00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:23,000
that will load external scripts from

00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:25,160
another site like I have one I have a

00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,250
client who is using a script that goes

00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:32,020
to an external social network to do

00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:33,930
things I'll be vague Connie went out

00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,550
and it wasn't to that I mean you know

00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:38,320
your most sites are gonna integrate with

00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:40,660
social networks in some way or with a

00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:43,600
third-party service but if calling that

00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:45,160
one external website takes three or four

00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,840
seconds to get the info you need from it

00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,490
and come back you don't have a ton of

00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,380
control if you still want to use that

00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,540
other site that it takes three or four

00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,190
seconds to get back to you and so my you

00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:56,410
know suggestion was either we find some

00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:57,940
other way to optimize the code but the

00:52:56,410 --> 00:53:01,360
quickest way to get that speed gains is

00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,740
to stop talking to that other website so

00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,670
it's not the number of plugins but what

00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:08,970
that one plugin is doing yeah oh yeah

00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:11,050
cool I'm gonna be at the happiness bar

00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,160
mostly afternoon and some of tomorrow

00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,840
