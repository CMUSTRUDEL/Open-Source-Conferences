Title: Jill Anderson: Getting Clients to Sign on the Dotted Line
Publication date: 2019-09-08
Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	Consultations, estimates, proposals, contracts, oh my! If onboarding your clients is a struggle, this session is for you. I’ll share my super straightforward system and break everything down into actionable steps you can put in place to get clients to sign on the dotted line. When you have a buttoned up client onboarding process, your clients will have confidence moving the project forward with you. It’s how you set the stage for a smooth and successful project (and keep yourself efficient, calm and sane).

getting clients to sign on the dotted

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:12,120
line all right yes so I'm Joel Anderson

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,160
I design and develop custom WordPress

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,310
sites for creative professionals and

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,850
I've been doing this full-time for about

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:27,000
12 years now yeah so this talk actually

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:29,849
came from an idea talking to sue about

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,700
you know around some processes and

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,550
things that I do with my clients to make

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,300
sure we have a good relationship and get

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,340
the project started in a good way so I

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,489
just want to share that experience so

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,129
with all of you so yeah so if you have a

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,989
client and or maybe they're not your

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,390
client yet but they're interested in

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,610
working with you and you know they want

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,149
to talk to you and learn more what do

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,430
you do do you like start firing off

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,530
ideas and jump into the project and

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,350
think about money and time to them and

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,390
all that later or you know do you want

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,189
to step back a little and do some pre

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,900
work to make sure that everything goes

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:15,689
smoothly and I just want to say this

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,240
process I'm gonna share it's my way it's

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,130
not the only way and you might differ

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,240
and your approach and that's perfectly

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,729
fine so you know just take everything I

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,380
say with a grain of salt and some of it

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,810
I hope will work for your business and

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,180
you know there's other stuff then don't

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,470
worry about it all right so yeah so

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,509
today we're going to talk about these

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,650
four things we're going to talk about

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:44,159
contracts vetting the prospect or talk

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:49,320
about money and preparing for a strong

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,090
project kickoff so the first thing is

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,329
the contact and probably the most

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,579
important I think of all of them so is

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,810
there anybody who does not use a

00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,810
contract right now

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:12,950
well we'll figure that out yeah

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:14,660
so I say everybody needs a contract I

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,360
think if you're going to be successful

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,880
as a business person and providing these

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,709
services to your clients you need to be

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,080
on the same page with that and that's

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,230
really what a contract does so whether

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,540
it's a bunch of legalese or it's you

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,360
know written in plain English and is

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,220
super simple either way a contract

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,160
saying here's what I'm going to do for

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,550
you here's what I can expect from you in

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,720
return we'll make a project much more

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,730
successful so do you need a lawyer I

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,430
don't think you necessarily need a

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,290
lawyer to write out a contract to share

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,580
it with your client to have them sign it

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:58,010
and to start the work I think it can be

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,410
a good idea to have an attorney review a

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,000
contract just to make sure it's on the

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,239
up-and-up and you know everything you're

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,100
doing is good and in your best interest

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,340
should you need you know should there be

00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,560
a dispute or problem later on that your

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,250
client or your contract will hold up

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,549
so having a lawyer review it would be

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:23,900
awesome but you don't necessarily need a

00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:27,860
lawyer to start using contracts and then

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,450
what if they don't sign it I've never

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,700
had this problem you know in 12 years

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,769
I've never had a client say all right

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm ready but your contract enough I

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,940
just I don't want to have anything to do

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
with that because if they did say that

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:44,959
I'd probably be like oh that's a giant

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,570
red flag like why not so I'd say it's

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,480
the contract shouldn't be like a

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,160
deterrent for people working with you if

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,280
anything I think a contract should make

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,930
people feel more comfortable about

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,390
working with you because you value

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,549
yourself as you know business

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,860
professional and you know you have your

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,450
clients best interests in mind so having

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,299
that and showing that at the beginning

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,199
of the relationship I think just can

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:14,480
only make things better so what to

00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,540
include in your contract and then sue

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,030
you asked about what is proposed of fire

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:24,830
yeah so I I'd say you know are these

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:26,690
things in that agreement or contract

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,110
that you're working on so there's

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,820
usually a terms and conditions section

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,520
this can be a bunch of legalese it's may

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,560
be basically defining what you're going

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,639
to talk about in the contract like you

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,919
know I'm the designer you're the client

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,199
you might have designer tools you might

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,380
have deliverables so you know words that

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,990
you'll see throughout the contract

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:54,280
they'll be defined in this like terms

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,560
and conditions section effective dates

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,479
you don't want your prices to be

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,460
effective forever right like if somebody

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:04,550
comes back three years after you send

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,070
them an estimate is that you know

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,360
estimate the cost or use that what

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,490
you're supposed to charge them three

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,340
years later so you should have some

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:20,960
language in there about how long this

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:23,810
estimate is valid for and you know if in

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,669
your effective dates you know this could

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,340
be a section where you talk about you

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,180
know if the any applicable fees if

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:36,700
things go on longer than they should I

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,700
kind of stuff so also fees and charges

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,900
you should define for your clients okay

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,360
here's what I'm going to expect in terms

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,110
of payment timeframe like I usually

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,849
break my projects into thirds but a

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,590
session this morning like maybe I should

00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,320
do that like over months like over six

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,849
months or something so however you do

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,490
that you wanted to find that for your

00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:00,020
client so they know what to expect and

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,750
also what happens with payments are late

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,880
are you gonna charge them a late fee you

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,440
know what does that look like because

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,200
there will be clients that will pay you

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,180
late and you want to protect yourself if

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,090
it's super late and you want to charge

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,760
them fees for that grant of Rights you

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,190
need to say who owns what and when I

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,770
mean for me once I have received full

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,080
payment then they the client has the

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,289
right to use all my work and do whatever

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,390
they want with it you know different

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:30,220
fields might do different

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:41,140
things with how they grant rights but

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:45,400
whatever it is yeah yeah that would be a

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:48,790
good place to say like hey I want to

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,610
include ya if you want to include that

00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:55,330
like on your portfolio or submit to

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,000
design awards or anything like that you

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,040
know anything you're gonna do it's a you

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,930
know it's a good place to state that

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,130
somewhere in your contract but granted

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,020
rights would be good for that client

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:11,590
responsibilities so what happens if the

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,600
client turns out to be awful like if

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,850
they don't make timely decisions or

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,210
don't provide you the content on time

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,290
which happens all the time it feels like

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,810
you know what if there are errors in the

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,700
project that are found you know six

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,920
months or a year later who's gonna be

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
responsible for that I don't want to be

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,850
responsible for that

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:34,300
so my contract is gonna state that you

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:36,940
know upon the client signing off on it

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,300
and everything that that is now back in

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,290
their hands should there be errors

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,430
confidential information you know of

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:48,040
course you want to be you know

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,040
upstanding and not disclose anything you

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,330
might learn during the project to other

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,340
clients or industries or whatever that

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,050
the client wouldn't be happy about so

00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,590
definitely let them know that you'll

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,000
keep it all in your head and nowhere

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,790
else

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,860
so relationship of the parties like I'm

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:09,430
an independent contractor and there's no

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,440
exclusivity you know you're not an

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,450
employee I mean I guess if you wanted to

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,020
be but this wouldn't be what we

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:20,320
discussing then but uh and then you know

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,930
you or at least I state that you know if

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,660
a dog trainer hires me to do their site

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,180
then I can do another site for you know

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,300
five other dog trainers and nobody has

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:35,830
the right to have me not take on other

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:39,010
work that I want to warranties are you

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:41,110
know again in the future what's it going

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,919
to be like for this project your time

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,139
period

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,540
supports after the project is Danya for

00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:49,930
a website of course that might live for

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,880
years after it's launched you know what

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,920
are you responsible for so in my

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,399
contract I say you know if you find

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,170
something within 30 guys do 90 days of

00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,269
it launching you know a bug or something

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,180
crazy I will fix that as part of the

00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:05,800
project fee I have a maintenance plan so

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:12,010
I also put some language in about what

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,600
that includes your like liability

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,209
section you know again in the future

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,500
something happens who's responsible you

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:22,149
want to not be responsible basically

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,920
term and termination is you know what if

00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,540
the project gets cancelled what if you

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
need to cancel the project because the

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,680
client is terrible and you're just ready

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,000
to be done with them you should have

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,220
some language in your contract that

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,339
allows you to do so also if the project

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,019
stalls like if your clients are not

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,880
giving you what you need to finish this

00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:46,540
project I have some language in my

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,670
contract if it's been over 90 days I

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,610
haven't heard from them the project can

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,079
go on hold and I have a restart fee so

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,120
it's gonna cost you five hundred bucks

00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:58,180
or ten percent of the project fee

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:04,269
whoever's greater - you know restart it

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:05,560
again mm-hmm I have exactly yes five

00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,660
hundred dollars or ten percent I think

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,260
whatever's greater as a restart you know

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,850
haven't actually build a client that but

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,730
I've referenced it before like you know

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,079
hey I realize it's been a few months we

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,769
really need to get back on checker I

00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:23,320
don't want to have to enforce this thing

00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:25,810
and usually the idea of having to pay

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,220
more money will get people moving and

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,220
hopefully get the project done and

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,819
miscellaneous stuff terms can be

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:38,740
modified but only in writing client can

00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:41,319
authorize expenses you know orally

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,430
revisions any disputes must go through

00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:49,240
arbitration that's an important part

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:50,410
I've had clients want their deposit back

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,190
and

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,950
I only had this happen well really twice

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,390
but once where they're really nasty

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:03,010
about it and I thought I did a really

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:05,890
good job on the work I've done so far so

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,430
the amount of the deposit which in my

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,180
contract

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,370
I say it's non-refundable kind of makes

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,410
it so that if we went through

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,980
arbitration it wouldn't be in their best

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,630
interest to really pursue that you know

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,510
I don't want them to take me to small

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,970
claims court so I think stating that

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,300
arbitration should be used can be a good

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,060
thing

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:33,880
and of course signatures on the contract

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:36,250
makes it all real some resources my

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,130
contract is actually based off the AIG

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:42,040
A's standard contract and has just been

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:45,220
modified over the years freelancers

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:52,390
Union has a good one too so those are

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:54,610
good good places to check out I'll share

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,990
links to these slides to at the end if

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,990
you don't get everything written down

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,210
all right so once you have your contract

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,490
you want people to be able to sign it

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,860
online just make it super easy so

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,930
clients don't you know you don't want to

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,950
be faxing or anything crazy like that

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,030
these days so I use hello sign I love

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,550
hello son

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,440
I think it's like 13 bucks a month or

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,320
something I think it's a pretty

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,530
affordable fee for what you get which is

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,680
really easy signing really easy you know

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:32,140
I upload a PDF put my signature fields

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,240
where I want have the dates reflected

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,080
where they when they signed it and

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,790
updates the date for me and my signature

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,590
and then keeps an archive of that for me

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,090
so I can go back and look did this

00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,580
client sign their contract - this client

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,340
sign their contract and then I also put

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:52,030
a link up on my website which is Jill in

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:54,400
design.com slash terms which has links

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:57,190
to download my contract PDF and then

00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,690
also links / - hello sign so you

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,770
definitely wanted some place to sign

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,950
online and links for where people can

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,950
access

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,839
so now we get into like Oh somebody

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:15,009
wants to work with me okay well what do

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:18,759
you do your next step is qualifying and

00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:20,500
vetting the client because just because

00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,009
someone wants to work with you doesn't

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,899
mean you want to work with them you'll I

00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:26,709
maybe it's just sewing your own button

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,569
you know once you've been in business

00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:32,829
long enough you start to realize yeah

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:35,769
not everybody is a good fit and for me

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:38,649
having a consultation call I call it a

00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:40,899
free chat you know 30 minutes just to

00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,879
get ideas about the projects you know

00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:45,879
make sure that I can communicate with

00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,129
this person it just goes a long way to

00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:52,569
knowing that it's going to be excercises

00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:55,569
successful project so consultation calls

00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:58,089
you know if you're you can certainly

00:13:55,569 --> 00:14:00,519
meet people in person if your clients

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,550
are local to you that's also an option

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,930
my clients are all over the place so

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,610
calls are the way to go

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,610
I usually do mine just as phone calls

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,439
but you know you zoom chats or you know

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:15,970
however videoconferencing however you

00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:18,819
want to do it and then I use an online

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,800
scheduler calendly to make it really

00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:24,309
easy for people to schedule calls with

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,139
me I started using this like a year or

00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:28,420
two ago and I was like where was this

00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:30,819
thing all my life because it is like

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,949
hands-down one of the best ways to save

00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:35,350
time because you just I just say here's

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:38,980
my calendar 'link calendly comm slash

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,319
Julie Anderson and I have it I scheduled

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,930
my calls to say Wednesdays Thursdays

00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:46,029
from 10:00 to 2:00 cuz that's good for

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,649
me my kids aren't home they're super

00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:51,040
loud I don't like to be on the phone

00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:54,459
when they're around it's not too early

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,139
in the morning and I have it synched

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,389
with my Google Calendar so like if I

00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:00,939
make a doctor's appointment or something

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:04,120
it'll take that off my availability and

00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:07,089
then it's just like hey you client pick

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,819
a time that works super easy for you and

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,290
where we saved back and forth emails and

00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:14,879
all that

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:17,479
pick a time and on this consultation

00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,699
call you definitely need to discuss

00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:23,249
timeframe budgets and where they are in

00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:25,489
the decision-making process so I start

00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:27,929
off each call really by saying all right

00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:30,209
tell me a little bit about your business

00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:32,609
and your projects and we'll see how I

00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:36,720
can help and then I just let them talk

00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:39,269
and I just sit back and listen and doing

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,649
active listening to really get an idea

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:43,259
okay am I going to be able to

00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:45,089
communicate with this person does this

00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,279
project seem like it's going to be fun

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:50,699
am I the best fit for it you know maybe

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,809
they want something that I don't do or I

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:56,999
can't do or I don't want to do so really

00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:00,209
you know just listening to their needs

00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:02,459
and then you know you start offering

00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,749
some solutions but not you know you

00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:06,209
don't want to do the work for them at

00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:07,919
this point at all it's more like yeah

00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:10,489
I think this would be a good fit here's

00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,749
why here's how I think I can help you

00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:15,299
but yeah definitely discussing all right

00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:17,009
what's your timing like you know am I

00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:21,660
going to be able to meet that timeframe

00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:23,429
and budget how much money you have but

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,529
also you know a lot of times clients

00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:29,249
don't want to give you their budget but

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:32,160
you know letting them know your ranges

00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:33,449
or fees you know in some way so that you

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,480
know you're on the same page and they're

00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:40,499
not thinking it's $1,000 and you're

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,629
thinking it's $5,000 and where they are

00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,789
in the decision-making process you know

00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:46,289
they could just be starting or they

00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:48,660
could be like ready to go and I think

00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:51,720
it's important to know that so that you

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,859
can respond adequately and you know take

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,480
the time you need with them that they're

00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:57,299
ready to go and you really like this

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,609
project it feels like a good fit you

00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:03,449
know you might be more out to really

00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:05,429
pursuing it and then of course paying

00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:09,990
attention to the red flags while you're

00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:11,879
on this call or even in person just to

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,709
know like maybe this isn't going to work

00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:18,629
out so these are some various ones yeah

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:20,309
if they don't have a budget well why are

00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:23,790
we talking if you have no money to get

00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:25,620
me if they badmouth

00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,200
these creatives or previous service

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,640
providers that are what you do

00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,590
everybody's had bad experiences and

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,640
that's fine and we're human and you know

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,080
if they want to talk about it that's

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,720
great but if they do it in like a

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,910
disrespectful way you know maybe the

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,400
problem isn't the creative it's the

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,710
clients so you just want to keep an eye

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,570
on your out for that you're having

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,180
communication issues you know you're

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,640
just not gelling well they have trouble

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,370
defining what they want that can always

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,680
lead to issues later if they're in a

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,880
rush like I don't take on rush work it

00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,140
just gives me anxiety and it's no fun

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,410
you know you might love wife's work and

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,540
then so good but if they're in a rush

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,120
might not be the best fit for me if they

00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,490
talk about their personalized a lot you

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,740
know you might have to always hear that

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,230
on the phone with them you know it this

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,850
is a business thing we're into you know

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,490
sell websites or whatever it is we're

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:23,130
doing we don't need to hear the drama in

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,750
their lives if they stand you up that's

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,310
like a big red flag like look we have

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,650
this meeting on the if you can't make it

00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:30,300
that's fine but let me know what we're

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,610
schedule or whatever but you know if

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,040
they just don't show up that's that's no

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,380
good they want everything that's never

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,980
good you want to be able to rein them in

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,260
into like manageable phases of a project

00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,600
they're waiting for a check to clear

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,250
it's not necessarily bad but you know I

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,010
don't necessarily want to know about all

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,300
your financial things I want to know

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,040
that you're going to be able to pay me

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,950
but I don't want to hear excuses either

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,010
so and if they're too busy doing other

00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,660
things while they're talking to you you

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,610
know they're putting you on hold and

00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,710
there's just like lots going on you know

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,660
that's probably might be an indicator of

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,360
how the project is going to go and that

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,870
might not be good either keep an eye out

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,180
for this when you're vetting people and

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,990
your own personal red flags to as to you

00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,820
know things you want to stay away from

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:23,940
okay so you've got your contract and

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,710
you've talked to somebody so the next

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,550
part of this process you show me the

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:31,530
money and I don't think any product is

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,020
real until you've received money for it

00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,390
so any new client if they want me to

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,350
start a project they're gonna have to

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,450
give me a deposit

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,340
you know everybody's always excited

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,420
ready to go let's get this started we've

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,040
got great ideas but that's not going to

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,110
happen I'm not going to put you in my

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,270
calendar and schedule out your project

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,270
until you've given me some money for it

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:23,000
did you have a contract with them like

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:28,820
they're gonna make a deposit for your

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,800
service or I mean I say a deposits

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,080
important just because you want to

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,030
schedule time in your calendar for their

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,530
projects and you can't really do that or

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:43,240
I won't unless I have a deposit it also

00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:46,670
you know if you never took deposits and

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,170
you you might not ever know when people

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,170
are ready to actually start on a project

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,910
about a deposit I'm just very like

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,429
forthright about it okay so I break

00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,380
payments in 2/3 I require a third

00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:03,559
upfront and once you pay that deposit

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,840
and sign my contract then that's when we

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:09,860
can get the project scheduled and ready

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,679
to start I also usually booked a few

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,000
months out so I try to say you know the

00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:15,620
sooner you get me that deposit and

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,030
contract so we'll the sooner you're

00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,160
gonna get I'm gonna be able to get to

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,190
your project so I think it's pretty

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,429
commonplace in a service industry to

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,160
have a deposit you know because you

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:29,679
don't want to give away your time and

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,860
start working on stuff with without that

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,860
this is

00:21:41,530 --> 00:22:16,130
yeah yeah yeah I I give you're able to

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,230
pay online you know credit card or I

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:21,140
will accept checks too just because some

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:25,550
clients have to do it that way that's

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,530
fine yeah I mean I think that just goes

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,900
towards you know your overall marketing

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,940
strategy - and showing you know you have

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,430
this buttoned up contract and process

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,100
that you're a professional that like you

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:40,700
they can trust you with their money

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,040
you're not just going to run away but

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,400
packaging it up so I guess that could be

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,920
a talk all in its own is whether your

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,200
website prices are on your your project

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,110
prices are on your website and you know

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,120
do you offer any packages - because when

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:59,180
we talk about money with clients if you

00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,660
if they've seen what they can expect it

00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:05,690
can be a lot easier of a conversation so

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,180
I have website packages on my website

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,860
and I have my starting fees for those so

00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,590
when I'm having a conversation or a

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,570
client consultation call I can say hey

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,020
have you been on my services page have

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,580
you seen my prices so it can be a good

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,800
way to get that money conversation

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:26,750
started with knowing that they have an

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,550
idea and then you definitely want to use

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,400
accounting software like sue said

00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,990
there's all kinds of ones I love fresh

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,090
books I've been a customer of their

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:42,159
since 2008 they are awesome the only one

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:47,090
like harvests QuickBooks

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,889
17 hats yeah so all kinds of different

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,370
ones the only thing I say about any

00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:55,279
accounting software you use is I think

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:58,669
it should allow you to make one email to

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,190
the client that you can customize so I

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:03,049
once I talked to a client I want them to

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,029
get just one email from me with

00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,980
everything they need to get started

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,840
I don't want there to be a lot of

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,730
back-and-forth and different emails from

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,440
here and let me find the contract here

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,419
and find this estimate over here like

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,870
just one place one thing they can

00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:21,470
reference all there for them so the

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:23,929
email that I send out with fresh books

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,090
you know they have when I send out an

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,340
estimate or invoice they have a place

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,380
where you can put in your text so I have

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,269
this like boilerplate text that I copy

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,899
on in there

00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:38,450
I usually send this out right after the

00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:40,039
consultation call like right after we

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,679
get off the phone just get it out of the

00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,480
way and I'm going to tell them right

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,179
here I want to work with you

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,010
I'm currently booking projects to start

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:53,090
like right now in booking projects for

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:55,820
July I do have a questionnaire I use so

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,620
I throw that link in there I think

00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,000
that's a good way to get people started

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,220
to think like what you're going to talk

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,039
about or what information you're going

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,679
to need from them and then I have my

00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,330
three steps like once these items are

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:12,320
completed whom then we can get our

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,850
kickoff session started so I want them

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,740
to review and accept the estimate and

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:19,490
fresh books you can like accept the

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,080
estimate like click a button then I'll

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,960
send them an invoice so they need to pay

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,639
that invoice and sign my contracts are

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,179
there so that link back over to my

00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:30,919
contract on hellosign and then you know

00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:33,620
I look forward to working with them so

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:39,169
they get this email from me after every

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:42,110
consultation call and then hopefully

00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:45,620
you've gotten your contract you've

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:48,919
gotten your deposit and now you have an

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,649
official project so yay so this is like

00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:54,110
an extra step here at the end they've

00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:55,130
signed on the dotted line but it's that

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,520
way that kind of

00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,990
move that from okay now we've been doing

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,860
client onboarding and now we're actually

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:07,040
gonna start off the project so I also

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,660
have a kickoff call again I like to talk

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,170
to people on the phone or if they were

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:15,080
in person you could do it that way too

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,700
and then now is where we really get into

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,030
the nitty-gritty of the project and

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,650
start discussing what we're going to do

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,170
so using a project questionnaire can be

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,700
great as the scope of work that's the

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:30,080
questionnaire that I placed in that

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,630
email that I sent with my estimates and

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,060
now finally you can get to work through

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,430
all of that

00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,680
and that's it so that's the process

00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:41,930
fairly easy and straightforward and then

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,310
of course here's links to the slides and

00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,310
all these fun stuff you can get from me

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,440
