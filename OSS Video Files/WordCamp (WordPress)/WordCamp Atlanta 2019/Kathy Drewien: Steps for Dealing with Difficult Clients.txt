Playlist: WordCamp Atlanta 2019
Description: 
	Ah, clients—we need them, we crave them. WordPress consultants and freelancers mostly live in attraction mode, constantly building a vibrant roster of sweet-spot clients. But not every client is a good client. So while you’re courting new relationships, beware of the challenging types of clients almost never worth the trouble.
After this session attendees will be able to:
– Identify danger signals before engagement
– Learn 5 steps for handling difficult clients
– Discover how to politely fire a challenging client
– How to prevent future nightmare clients

I didn't even test my sound are you good

00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:15,030
okay thank you

00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:19,500
oh I will have no problem speaking out

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:22,439
okay welcome everybody I am so glad to

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,800
see familiar and unfamiliar faces here

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,970
for our discussion at length about

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,960
difficult clients not only about the

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:38,520
difficult client but more importantly

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,590
how to avoid getting difficult clients

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,620
how you deal with them all those kinds

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,930
of things I will talk forever I've asked

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,020
my monitor over here to give me a ten

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,750
minute showdown but I hope you find the

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:57,149
information both helpful as well as

00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:00,030
entertaining by and large we have great

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,120
clients for the most part right

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,030
they bring interesting projects to the

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,460
table we learn things from them they

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:13,439
learn things from us it's a mutually

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:16,200
respectful relationship for the most

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,759
part but I've learned over years and

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:25,380
years and years of attending WordPress

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,210
camps and word camp meetups that the

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,070
people we talk about when we get

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:40,049
together are not those wonderful ideal

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:42,509
clients who do we talk about we talk

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,270
about these guys right the ones that

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:49,460
cause the supplier here out and we just

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,820
grown in agony you wouldn't believe

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,710
right

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,310
so probably what we're going to do today

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,350
is talk about I'll just talk about the

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,710
clients we're going to talk about the

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,490
personas that a lot of clients fit in

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,259
with us and the reasons why we want to

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,060
deal with them when we want to keep our

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,140
hair right

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:17,220
we're talking about the situations that

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,819
cause us a lot of stress the situations

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,790
that rob us of the joy as to why we went

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,890
into business ourselves I'm assuming

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,590
then if you're in this room almost all

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,840
of you are self-employed freelancers

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,390
have some sort of relationship with

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,680
clients right that's all I got right

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:41,640
okay we're talking about the situations

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,269
where someone is are arguing with you

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:50,700
all the time they're pushing back you

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:53,519
say left they say right we're also

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,269
talking about situations where you don't

00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:01,890
get paid either because the payment is

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:03,540
slow or because they refuse to pay this

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,060
all sound familiar I see a lot of heads

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,269
going yeah preach it lady

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:14,430
we know yeah and then there's those

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:18,920
situations where they just do the

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:21,780
damnedest stuff don't they they just

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,440
it's just crazy they do something but it

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:32,150
makes no sense to us in short difficult

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,150
clients are costing us money right okay

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:41,930
let's talk about penny-pinching Paul now

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,470
I'm old and I know who this is a picture

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:49,280
of I'll let me rephrase that I'm not old

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:52,040
I've lived a long time okay for those of

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:57,470
you who are lot younger than I am this

00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00,829
is Jack Benny a notorious well known

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,840
penny pincher and if you google penny

00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:06,440
pincher as I did when I was looking for

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,010
images that one came up okay

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,040
now the face of your penny pincher might

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,500
look very different but these are the

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,000
situations that come up where every

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,039
invoice is scrutinized I don't

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,660
understand why you build me for three

00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:28,400
hours it was just a simple thing okay

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,530
right I mean it you can read for

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,800
yourself they argue about every little

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,800
detail

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,120
choo choo choo choo choo choo choo I'll

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:43,340
flip my notes over in the beginning Paul

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,700
might seem very professional and well

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:53,510
put together but over time that push

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:56,660
back becomes an irritant can I do what

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:59,690
oh yes it is isn't it let's see what I

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:04,130
can do with that I don't have a clue

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:07,010
you'll just have to live with that it

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,250
probably has something to do but it's

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,240
not going to be important oh these are

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,490
all available

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,080
yeah it's I'll tell you how to find it

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,210
yeah it's it because the screen is

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,370
expanded here it has to do something

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,289
with how the resolution I'm the Mary and

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,400
it would take me more time to figure it

00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:32,960
out then to just keep going okay

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:38,110
so who has a penny pincher oh my gosh

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,110
every hand is raised right all right

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:45,159
there's some other types of folks we

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:48,740
deal with there's one that I refer to as

00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:52,589
emergency Ellen

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,330
yeah everybody has some of these my

00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:56,939
emergency Ellen

00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:02,900
starts every subject line of an email

00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:06,569
with urgent in all caps all the time

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:12,379
doesn't matter what it is it's always

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:15,539
urgent another example of the urgency is

00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:17,999
they give you a call on Monday to

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:21,899
discuss their newest brainstorm of a

00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:23,939
project and by Tuesday afternoon they're

00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,569
sending you email it's about the status

00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:30,210
of it right they tend to think not that

00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:33,899
they are your only client but they are

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,879
in that urgent mode right they think I'm

00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,129
gonna mention it to you and you're gonna

00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,059
clear your calendar and I'm gonna work

00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,479
right ahead

00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,479
right

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,630
I'm okay I'm having to read my notes

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,880
today because my brain is shifting from

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,000
having been an organizer to walking in

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,460
this room but so so no matter how many

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,130
times you try and set the expectations

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,260
with emergency Ellen maybe I'll do this

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,100
you know you email back I work this way

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:10,590
and I work that way they just never hear

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,930
it some expenses it sound like the

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:18,030
people you're working with you know it's

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:22,130
just yes oh yes yeah these are not

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:28,400
mutually exclusive right right

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:28,400
let's take a look at terrible Terry

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:39,510
Terry is Terry is a bully likes the

00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:41,280
sound of their own voice they enjoy

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,390
standing on the shoulders of other

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,460
people to make themselves look taller

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:50,670
this is the person if you if you have a

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:54,300
team this is the person that all emails

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:57,450
and phone calls are ignored by your team

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:02,240
and deferred to you y'all got some

00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:05,610
Terry's in your clientele uh-huh

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,330

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,600
terrible Terry is the one who keeps you

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:30,210
awake at night because you are in fear

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:34,170
of their wrath you know it's not beneath

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:36,750
them to belittle you and publicly and

00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:40,920
loudly and so a lot of your

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,650
decision-making is tempered with what's

00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,450
he going to say okay

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,089
sound familiar y'all got some of those

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:52,220
right

00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:56,209
okay this is this is a nightmare client

00:08:52,220 --> 00:09:03,559
not just a difficult client oh and my

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:07,160
favorite stampede sandy I'm sorry sandy

00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:09,800
it's definitely not chair it's also not

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,759
the name of the client that I had in

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:17,300
mind

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:19,519
oh my gosh hey this is a real segue have

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,160
you ever sold a house that you spent a

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,059
lot of time landscaping and it's

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,759
gorgeous

00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:28,699
and three years later you know you've

00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,999
sold it and you drive by and they have

00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:34,879
mowed down every damn thing you put up

00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:37,819
okay that's stampede sandy you have

00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:41,839
delivered the website to them it's

00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:48,620
gorgeous it's functional and then one

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:53,149
day is just not Stampede sandy leads us

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:58,160
as designers and developers and very

00:09:53,149 --> 00:10:00,170
proud of our work to make them not an

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,660
admin we don't give them the full rights

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:05,649
to their website for fear of them going

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,999
in and messing things up y'all do that

00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:13,610
you have to keep total control of your

00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:16,040
website we can talk about the pluses and

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:21,519
minuses of that but it's this character

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,519
that that creates that and in us right

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:32,149
my stampede sandy looked like the ideal

00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:35,149
client when we met we spent time and

00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:39,230
discovery and it was a paid discovery

00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:42,139
process I mean not $200 it was much

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,629
larger than that and we spent hours and

00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:48,379
hours an hour scoping out the project

00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:50,870
and we were in agreement and we were

00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:55,670
rocking along and then we would present

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:59,959
the functionality and then it wasn't

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,959
right and we're miss communicating it's

00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,439
like

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,619
we're not matching up cut to the chase

00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:09,389
here's one of those clients that really

00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:12,829
thought that they wouldn't have to do

00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:16,019
anything I want this high-end

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:18,360
functionality but I don't want to have

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:22,949
to touch the buttons to put in the data

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:27,290
entry okay yeah and some of that

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:27,290
stampeding at the end was me on her

00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:40,199
here's my picture of stampede sandy one

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,730
of our favorites how many people are

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,029

00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:49,800
hands mm-hmm

00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:57,089
more than a year anybody waiting more

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:59,970
than a year two years yeah there was a

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:03,720
little bit of this when I was talking in

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,819
Raleigh the hand stayed up for a long

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,240
time we got two three years they're

00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:10,889
still waiting on content uh-huh well

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,350
there's something wrong with us

00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:17,339
okay and we know that's how we prevent

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:22,759
some of this in the future I love this

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:25,139
guy waffling William laughing William

00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,269
couldn't decide to go out the front door

00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:31,949
or the back door if his pants were on

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:34,709
fire yeah you know you're trying to get

00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:37,829
feedback and input from the project and

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:41,819
keep the whole project in the

00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:47,059
middle-of-the-road right well I kind of

00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:50,850
like red but then blue is really nice

00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:53,809
what do you think I think you're gonna

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:57,420
make a position a lot of it right is

00:12:53,809 --> 00:13:03,059
they just won't agree or confirm to

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:04,589
anything and we left until I don't know

00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,980
about y'all I'm good at

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:12,660
passive-aggressive I grew up in south

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,280
and so I make the decision ever a kind

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,430
thing for those of you who didn't grow

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:21,210
up in the south yeah we'll talk about

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:23,280
what that really means later but with

00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:26,640
waffling Williams I make the decisions

00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,260
for them well of course that's not right

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,670
you have to go back and redo it but at

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:34,830
least a decision have been made and I

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:39,270
was doing something all right no matter

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:42,420
which nightmare is in your client

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:50,090
repertoire they all have some things in

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:52,590
common they don't respect your time they

00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:55,050
constantly are checking up on you

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,600
as if you're just gonna take their money

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,330
and disappear in the night sometimes

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,760
with reason because you're their third

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,740
person they've worked with and that

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,630
first two did take their money and run

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,960
off into the night but they might be

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:15,210
expecting results you can't possibly

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,180
deliver that wasn't my situation with my

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:23,400
Stampede you know she was expecting a

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:28,320
fully landscaped four acre plot of land

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:34,980
and was paying for you know a subprime

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:38,660
lot okay how about this they believe

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,040
that they could do a better job than you

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:47,280
because they have a computer science

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:50,640
degree from 1993 does that sound

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:54,360
familiar you know those are and it goes

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:58,170
hand in hand with the I don't understand

00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:01,820
why you billed me for three hours it

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:05,780
should have only taken 15 minutes okay

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:09,750
well we all know that that doesn't work

00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,940
and of course there are those who had

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:17,280
all over everything regularly pay late

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:19,570
or refuse to pay at all but no matter

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,529
how they present

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:27,490
the steps for managing them are much

00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:30,420
clearer let's see where I might be in my

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:37,660
slides oh yeah here we go my own time

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:40,870
okay the first thing is stay calm it is

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:44,350
very hard to stay calm when terrible

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:49,750
Terry is blasting you as loud as

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:51,209
possible but it is our job we're the

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,589
ones being paid

00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:56,670
we're the ones who say we're the

00:15:53,589 --> 00:16:00,310
professional so it is on our shoulders

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:03,699
to stay calm and set the tone of the

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:08,410
conversation it is a well documented

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:12,730
fact that if you are calling and ranting

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:17,139
at me and I begin to rent in return that

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:22,019
is only going to escalate but if I begin

00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:25,990
to slow the pace of the conversation

00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:31,660
take pauses so that I can take a deep

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:34,959
breath and listen carefully then the

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:38,740
person who is owned in communication

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:43,180
with me if Terry is ranting he

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:48,459
eventually will start to mirror my tone

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:51,190
and my pace of conversation if not you

00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:53,829
can always politely say this doesn't

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,889
seem to be a good time let's schedule

00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:58,690
another call okay I'm not encouraged

00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:02,290
encouraging you to stay on the line with

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:04,089
somebody who's being abusive my daughter

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,929
gave me a call the other day now my

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:11,290
daughter is a grown woman and she's been

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:16,540
having to deal with a government agency

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:19,500
for six months trying to get something

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:23,500
resolved in relation to her dad's estate

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:26,439
and youth first-tier we've all had this

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,880
with customer service first here is you

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,770
know really putting her off putting her

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,100
off well she sent me a text the other

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:37,720
day I got a verbal reprimand

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:40,299
for my abusive language so you do not

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,299
have to tolerate abusive language I'm

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:45,039
not asking you to to put yourself in a

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:48,160
relationship where somebody's abusing

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:52,120
you but it is our job and it's the

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:57,549
professional to stay calm and take

00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:02,760
control of that conversation we want to

00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:06,640
listen carefully to their concerns

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:10,000
active listening which is a thing which

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,000
means I am actively paying attention to

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,159
what you are saying and trying to

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,100
understand where it's coming from as

00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:21,460
opposed to immediately jumping into my

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,610
brain how to respond and fix it which is

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:27,070
hard for us we like to solve problems

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:30,419
we're addicted to solving problems so

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:37,270
slowing that pace down also helps us to

00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:40,450
listen listen carefully not just

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,360
difficult clients but people want to

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:49,330
feel heard they want to feel

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:51,880
acknowledged and recognized and in the

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:57,370
process of me slowing down and paying

00:18:51,880 --> 00:19:01,270
attention I can hear what they are not

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,610
saying does that make sense I'm reading

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:07,500
between the lines I can come to

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:11,730
understand that why they are reacting

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:15,940
the way they are reacting it's usually

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:18,460
emotion driven they're scared they feel

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,380
betrayed they don't feel acknowledged I

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,990
mean there's something we think about

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,659
your own personal life when you get when

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:28,990
you become a difficult haunt none of

00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:31,000
y'all are difficult clients are you yeah

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,510
right me neither

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,510
okay

00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:43,650
my client that starts every subject with

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:47,220
urgent is also prone to say things like

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,220
nothing's working

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,659
when you say nothing's working can you

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:58,870
help me understand what that means

00:19:54,659 --> 00:20:02,530
everything is broken when you say

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:05,799
everything's broken can you show me are

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:09,909
you in front of your computer now can

00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,470
you show me what's broken that also

00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,900
gives them something to do that takes

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,809
them out of the situation and you begin

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,630
to drill down because what everything

00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:21,669
broken means to them is certainly the

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,230
whole damn website's not down it's not

00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:24,900
the white screen of death or they would

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:30,039
have started the conversation different

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:33,600
but I need to ask great questions and I

00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:39,150
can only ask great questions if I am

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:44,770
listening carefully and being called I

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:46,299
also want my responses to be prompt then

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,730
we've already talked about how nobody

00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:52,030
wants to handle terrible Terry he's our

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:56,500
nightmare and so when that email comes

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:58,600
in I save it for later

00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,970
and the next thing you know it's in your

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,330
inbox and it's drifted down and then

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:09,250
spend three days that ain't cool because

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:11,980
what happens if I wait three days they

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,220
get angrier uh-huh it doesn't fix

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:22,799
anything so a common courtesy of a

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:26,740
prompt reply our job in this

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:31,559
conversation is to figure out what the

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:33,190
hell happened where did this go so wrong

00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,700
this time

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:40,440
what is it in this situation where I

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,440
mean because I need to understand

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,000
sometimes it's a technical thing right

00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:49,299
sometimes it might just be a bug but

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,539
bugs don't make people difficult it's

00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:56,220
usually an emotional issue where

00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:59,049
somebody expected one thing and got

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,470
something different it's a breakdown in

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:05,200
communication so I really have to figure

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:08,110
out where did it go off the rails what

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:13,570
could I have said differently or done

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:16,059
differently to prevent this has anybody

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,919
had a relationship with a client where

00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,679
when it was all said and done and you

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:27,880
wrapped it up tight neat you went and

00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:31,240
revised your contract yeah yeah I give

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:35,110
you a quote today but I don't put an

00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,059
expiration date on it and two years from

00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:40,360
now you come back and say I want to move

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:43,779
forward on this quote oh man I certainly

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,940
got to revise that stuff right so it's a

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,970
learning experience for me as the

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:52,659
professional as to how I need to change

00:22:48,970 --> 00:23:00,010
my behaviors in response to the work

00:22:52,659 --> 00:23:03,549
that I deliver someone asked me earlier

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:07,929
this week can you tell me about a

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:13,000
project that went off the rails and what

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:15,880
you learned from it do you ask that

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,250
question of yourself when things go off

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,559
the rails

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:23,320
you know it's yeah some of you do some

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,820
of you don't if I am going to grow as a

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:31,510
professional in my field then I need to

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:35,110
take these circumstances and put them on

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:38,279
my shoulders and evaluate it what could

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,279
I have done differently

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,799
we want to offer a solution not

00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:48,379
necessarily a quick fix and it's also

00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:51,830
not about admitting that you were wrong

00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:54,889
oh I'm so sorry that happened maybe I am

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:58,960
but I need to understand what happened

00:23:54,889 --> 00:24:02,989
before I start saying I'm sorry

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,419
in my first life I was a therapist and I

00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:07,610
would ask my therapy clients when they

00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:10,879
you know some people just apologized for

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,609
everything you know they you run into

00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:18,320
them and they say I'm sorry right in

00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:21,070
order for me to be sincerely apologetic

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,389
I need to do what I'm apologizing for

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,519
what was the real offense

00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:27,769
so don't start out of the conversation

00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,279
going I'm so sorry this happened you

00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:35,299
want to go through this process first if

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:39,399
you're in the wrong admit it you don't

00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:42,950
want to put the blame on your client

00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,609
even if they are the one who made the

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,700
mistake

00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,409
don't ever do this right in the email

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,720
back to this person and they've said

00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:55,249
blabbity blabbity blabbity blabbity and

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,779
you say I know that's because blabbity

00:24:55,249 --> 00:25:00,590
blabbity blabbity blabbity and you're

00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:02,570
trying to educate them you say and teach

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,059
them what you really want to do is

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:11,029
explain why you did what you did that

00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:13,789
they really are at fault but not me that

00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:16,609
doesn't don't play well don't play well

00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:21,259
you cannot change people's behavior

00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:22,850
unless they change the way they think

00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:25,399
it's one of the things that Chris said

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,619
right off the bat this morning you know

00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:33,169
just because you believe it's true

00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:36,529
doesn't mean it's true I like to teach

00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:39,070
people and so a lot of times I find

00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:42,799
myself constructing an email response

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:44,960
that is well I did this because that

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,429
hooks did that that goes over here and

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:53,529
leans on this and therefore I ins don't

00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:53,529
care they just want their stuff to work

00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:01,370
um again back to communication

00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:07,010
breakdowns and sometimes you can convert

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:10,720
a difficult client to an okay client and

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:15,250
maybe even groom them into a good client

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:20,360
but that's not usually what happens now

00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:23,780
sometimes you just have to fire the

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:28,340
client and that's okay and there are

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:32,750
ways to fire clients and I'm gonna tell

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,160
you something I love them but you get

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,890
really good first you want to check your

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,600
contract to make sure you have a clause

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,390
in their says it's okay for me to fire

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:48,770
you and it's okay for them to fire you

00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:51,650
oh yeah I see that face it's just one of

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:54,290
those things in there I am a business

00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:59,810
owner you are a business owner you are

00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:03,610
not a waitress at IHOP you want five or

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:06,260
you want eight in that stack but when

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,190
that first phone call comes in with your

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,260
client and they're asking for a website

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,810
way too many of the clients I work with

00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,830
my coaching clients that I work with

00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:20,690
start with how many pages do you want a

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,550
slighty thing at the top you want to be

00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,900
a key role image do you want this do you

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:32,060
want that and we start taking orders

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:33,920
instead of stepping up but anyway check

00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,790
your contract is it okay for me to fire

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,350
you you want to not leave them hanging

00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:41,750
wind up the important work that you've

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:48,020
got on the table and then refer them

00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:51,260
somewhere else it's hard to do that the

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,720
first time it is really really hard to

00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,940
do that the first time one of my

00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,060
professional colleagues and I have been

00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:02,690
in communication for well over two years

00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:06,230
about a difficult client that they have

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:11,510
and she has finally in the last two

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:14,950
weeks gotten comfortable with saying I'm

00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:18,050
out of here okay let's take a look at

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:25,190
some conversation starters we can use in

00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:30,140
our emails when we reply to them we're

00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:32,630
moving in a new strategic direction you

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,450
own your business you do not have to

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:38,210
explain to them what that direction is

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:41,210
why you came to that conclusion

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:44,200
you only need to let them know how it's

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,200
going to impact them

00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,810
for example someone told me yesterday

00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:54,170
she said we've decided in our agency

00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:59,200
that we no longer offer one-on-one

00:28:54,170 --> 00:29:02,240
training to beginner WordPress users

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,090
nothing wrong with that decision it's

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,900
just a decision they made for a variety

00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:11,320
of reasons and as a result blah blah

00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:14,360
blah I need to refer you elsewhere right

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:18,470
that makes sense we've decided to move

00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:22,010
in a different direction we're

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:26,300
streamlining our business and if just

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,880
I'd have decided to yes pretty much

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,050
uh-huh in a nice way we're going to say

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,410
that it's I don't want to work with you

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:36,560
anymore but again it comes back to you

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:40,010
taking responsibility for your business

00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,500
and eliminating the difficult clients

00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:46,760
that are not converting that are robbing

00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:52,130
you of your joy here's a good one

00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:54,400
this is very easy we're increasing our

00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,400
fees

00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:02,100
some clients will choose to come with

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:08,640
you at the new rate other clients will

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:11,309
choose not to hit has your waste

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,100
management company ever explained to you

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:17,790
why your rates going up you just get two

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:20,460
sentences effective March 30th or 2020

00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,370
your race will increase by two this

00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,870
number

00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:31,320
love you miss you but you know thanks

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:35,160
regards but okay we don't have to

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:38,100
explain our business decisions to our

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,559
clientele and that is very very

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:44,970
difficult for most every freelancer I

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:46,830
have ever met ever whether it stems

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,980
around I want people to like me

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,760
I want them to understand I don't want

00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,830
them to badmouth me when they go away

00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:00,660
that's that's all doodoo between our

00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:04,669
ears okay here's one of my favorites

00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:08,340
we're phasing out your service plan I

00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:11,580
wrote this email myself just before I

00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:14,400
came here don't need to go too far in

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,910
depth about the circumstances except

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,910
that it is a client that a year ago

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:23,179
coming up on almost a year ago they pay

00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:27,559
their retainer a year in advance

00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:29,760
and off of that retainer I ultimately

00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:31,530
installed a whole new theme rebuilt

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,140
their website didn't charge them extra

00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:36,630
but they ate up every minute of those

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:40,830
30-minute tasks that I was offering them

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:42,710
as part of their service plan okay lady

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,840
who's been on the outs of that

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,370
relationship for a while comes back into

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,809
it ready to work on the website and

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:54,410
wants to know how many hours she has

00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:56,970
left in last year's retainer I

00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,250
stipulated that last year you paid me

00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,809
this amount of money and then I did this

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,429
which was the twenty five hundred dollar

00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,590
value and then I did that which was a

00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:07,590
fifteen hundred dollar value and blah

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:11,400
blah blah and therefore

00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:16,710
no time left on that for tasks and it

00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:21,299
renew it expires July 31st okay and then

00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:24,299
I said since we negotiate since during

00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:28,710
the time that we last negotiated that

00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:32,250
plan we have changed our rates it now

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:35,840
costs this and an outline what is there

00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:40,679
the response I got back was thank you

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,600
okay now come July 31st I'm gonna roll

00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,500
it out and I'm gonna say here's your new

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:49,820
plan you're paid or you go away I don't

00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,320
care I don't care

00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:56,490
but it's hard just get that email

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,289
started my friend who terminated the

00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,960
relationship the one we've been trying

00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:03,059
to terminate for her for two years

00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,530
started with not this one but what I've

00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,530
changed my business plan okay

00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:15,910
the biggest takeaway in dealing with

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:20,020
difficult clients is to begin to slow

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:23,980
down the own boarding process spend more

00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:26,460
time in that first conversation in that

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:30,190
conversation you want to be asking why

00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:35,860
questions why do you want a website

00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:39,160
today and why didn't you do it six

00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:41,380
months ago what would happen if you

00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,530
waited six more months what you're

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:48,730
trying to discover is what is the true

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:50,640
underlying motivation for why now don't

00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:54,700
start with how many pages do you need

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,520
ask great questions in the beginning and

00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:00,540
in order to ask great questions you have

00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,820
to be doing what unless something

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:05,500
carefully spend a lot of time it will

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,180
slow down your cash flow in the

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,570
beginning when you start transitioning

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:15,520
to a slower onboarding process but you

00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:18,540
will get better clients the fact that I

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,060
have difficult clients is my fault

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,850
every time every single time it's my

00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,909
fault maybe you are a hanger-on from

00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:30,040
when I started and was not confident and

00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:33,250
therefore I was charging you nickels and

00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,190
dimes and now I resent it whatever slow

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:40,270
down your process change your pricing

00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:45,280
structure prioritize your list of

00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:49,500
clients call the bottom 25% every single

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:54,310
year every single year take away those

00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:59,220
because the bottom 25% of your clientele

00:34:54,310 --> 00:35:03,300
is costing you 80% of your time energy

00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:06,190
joy and probably money that is a

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,810
documented thing I mean you can find one

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,510
of those curvy things and it'll have a

00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:13,900
fancy name that supports this this is a

00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:16,360
known fact get rid of the bottom people

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:20,200
all the time do it every year

00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,520
because I am not the same woman that I

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,310
was this time last

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,490
year I am not the same business owner

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:30,790
that I was this time last year my life

00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:35,260
has shifted the clients that I attract

00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:37,240
have shifted people that did not

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,420
irritate me day before yesterday just

00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,020
bug the hell out of me today that work

00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,100
for y'all

00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:46,780
I mean life changes and you need to

00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:50,530
change your bait your business

00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:55,660
accordingly that's all I got

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:57,880
except to tell you how to find me that's

00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,500
all my things I do lots and lots of

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,260
stuff but this is not a commercial about

00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:06,120
me this is just ways to follow up with

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:09,390
me we've got a few minutes for questions

00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,390
yes I am

00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,260
two questions that one of your

00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:20,790
strategies were kind of deflecting or

00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,790
phasing out mine was

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,300
we're moving a new strategic direction

00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,610
and then you said it's probably good if

00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:33,100
we refer them to smell what if you know

00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,600
this is such a malicious evil client

00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,120
that you don't want to burden other

00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,360
people

00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,360
[Music]

00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,510
okay okay let me stick with that one

00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,840
first

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:48,150
but yes I am uh-huh because I need to

00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,450
convince that question for the video and

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,880
for the transcriptionist in short what

00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:57,600
you said was when one of the comments

00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:01,160
that I had made in terms of terminating

00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:05,700
a client was to refer them elsewhere

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:08,520
except when as you asked what happens if

00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,620
they're so horrible that you don't want

00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,940
to inflict their pain on anybody else

00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:17,460
and do I have a solution for that I do

00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:20,880
you stop the conversation right after

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:23,310
saying effective this date we will no

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,650
longer be able to work with you I wish

00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:32,960
you much success in the future really

00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:37,590
easy to say very very difficult to write

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,500
it's I we're done is what you're saying

00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:43,740
in a more professional flavor

00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,770
does that help okay and you had a second

00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,770
question

00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:01,950
they're thicker so if I give them told

00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:05,869
us that these are my new but the breeds

00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:11,819
does that have to somehow be the ones I

00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:16,289
because well they they might find out

00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:20,009
that I oh that's a great question well

00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:23,549
and when it comes to quoting rates tell

00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:26,339
me your first name Tunnel is saying that

00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:28,049
she has us a sliding scale depending on

00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:30,180
the client and the circumstances and

00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:33,329
budget and all those kinds of things but

00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:36,569
it raises the question of if I offer you

00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:41,660
a dollar 25 and I sell it to you for 250

00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:41,660
and y'all talk what happens

00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,719
oops

00:38:43,019 --> 00:39:11,819
it's awful you got something Judy to add

00:38:45,719 --> 00:39:13,979
to that okay okay but we got some great

00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:17,609
responses to that let me repeat him for

00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:20,519
the camera GD was saying that if those

00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:23,789
two people get in conversation and it's

00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:28,880
brought up it you emphasize that there

00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:31,829
was a strategy behind that decision okay

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:37,499
and tell me your first name and cliff

00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:39,719
says I like them better and there there

00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:42,920
might be some ways to incorporate that

00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:45,920
even I mean in a more professional tone

00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,920
but

00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:55,060
off to the side and maybe maybe we can

00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,600
chat after the session I'm not so sure

00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:02,230
that offering a sliding scale is in your

00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:07,180
best interest I raise of hands how many

00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:10,750
people bill by the hour stop it just

00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,070
stop it it is not in your best interest

00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,110
and it's not in the clients best

00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:18,280
interest and we can talk about that in

00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:19,630
the hallway okay just stop it yes you

00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,860
need to have a sense of how much time

00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,200
it's going to take you to get something

00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:26,050
done but don't quote them a dollar two

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,740
and a quarter and then show them that it

00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:34,510
took you 15 hours to do it but just stop

00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:37,750
it okay make incorporating these changes

00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:40,210
it's hard work and I don't mean to imply

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,600
that it is not hard work I know that I'm

00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,480
being very glib with my responses but

00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,940
you have to be introspective you have to

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,950
figure out who you are and why you're

00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,980
doing what you do and what brings you

00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:58,060
the greatest joy and then attract those

00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:02,190
clients okay I have no idea what time it

00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,190
is okay yes ma'am

00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,510
[Music]

00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:15,339
okay I had to go back okay what am i

00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:19,619
yeah tell me your first name she all

00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:19,619
wants to know what are my top three cya

00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:31,569
okay yeah yes okay how I protect myself

00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:36,190
I don't know what my top three are but

00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:41,910
things like this proposal is good for X

00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:44,859
number of days okay in my retainer

00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,809
packages depending on what level they

00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:48,999
come in on and now they're purchasing a

00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:52,200
package at a different level which is

00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:56,039
very different than a sliding rate okay

00:41:52,200 --> 00:42:00,519
at this particular package level I offer

00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:04,140
X number of unlimited 30-minute tasks

00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:08,859
and I define what I mean by task

00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:11,589
it means update your content not update

00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,299
edit your content I'll go in and change

00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:16,630
paragraph for you if you send me that

00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:19,660
paragraph okay or a technical issue so I

00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:24,670
try to be very very clear about what I

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:30,059
will and will not do how many times can

00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:30,059
somebody come back with change my logo

00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:36,539
yeah not too damn many all right Judy

00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:44,609
one of my favorite things to say when

00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:47,230
I'm developing out the scope of work is

00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:50,019
to say based on the budget we've

00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:53,739
discussed we will table that for phase

00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:56,710
two okay

00:42:53,739 --> 00:43:01,749
most of my contract is short and sweet

00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:04,329
nitty-gritty it's there not to cover

00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:08,109
them all all situations but to cover a

00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:13,809
lot of them and it's to give the client

00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:15,260
a sense of no need to there give client

00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:17,990
any damn thing

00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:21,050
it's there so that I can come back and

00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:24,800
later say according to the terms of our

00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:28,100
contract which you have signed blah blah

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:42,590
blah does that help okay Josh you had a

00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:44,750
question in the beginning it starts in

00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:48,380
that first conversation with your client

00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:51,590
where you are delving deeply and you're

00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:54,380
set and you I like to be honest with

00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:57,320
them I know that your expectations are

00:43:54,380 --> 00:44:01,000
different I know that you want to be on

00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:06,460
page one of Google day after tomorrow

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,460
for 500 bucks I know that

00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:18,490
[Music]

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:22,539
right well it it does go over people's

00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:26,440
head but you know what I take my car to

00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:29,319
a mechanic and I do not question what

00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,930
they bill me I might grumble about it I

00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,059
may shop for mechanics but now that I

00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:38,410
have found a mechanic that I know and

00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:40,420
trust over several years I don't care if

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:42,849
they tell me this thing connects to that

00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,609
thing and how it works over here I know

00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:48,789
that I will drive out and my automobile

00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:51,609
will be improved clients don't care

00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:55,210
about what we do and how we do it

00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:58,240
they don't they never will

00:44:55,210 --> 00:45:01,269
you don't care how Amazon ships your

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,349
stuff to you they you just want it on

00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:07,329
your doorstep day after tomorrow right

00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:10,150
you don't care what they do how they

00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:12,339
send it how they process it what truck

00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,589
it gets on do they ship it to Atlanta

00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:17,019
and then it comes or do they send it by

00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:21,730
carrier pigeon you just want it on your

00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:23,950
doorstep day after tomorrow right that's

00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:27,250
the way your clients operate - they

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:29,170
don't care about you which is not the

00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:32,230
same as saying they don't respect what

00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:35,440
you do okay they don't care how you get

00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:38,470
the job done they want to solve

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,450
you just solve their problem and in

00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:45,789
order to solve your problem the most

00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:49,660
efficient and successful way I need to

00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:54,789
do a lot of things and that is going to

00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:58,359
cost you a lot of things and stand firm

00:45:54,789 --> 00:46:02,890
behind that this is what I need to do to

00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:07,779
solve your problem and if you cannot

00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:10,040
live with that nicely then you need to

00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:12,840
go away

00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:18,380
you just I can't I can't work for you

00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:20,580
that is somebody expecting unrealistic

00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:24,300
solutions for something you cannot

00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:32,550
deliver at that price anything else I

00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:45,120
know I need to wrap up Judy yes it's

00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:49,050
very very easy it's after after the

00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:51,420
whole thing after every talk we will

00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:53,580
post that stuff it this happens to be a

00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,950
Google slide presentation but I can't

00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:59,220
just say go to slice on google.com

00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:01,650
because you won't find me you know but

00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,510
they will be available because there's

00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:07,710
content in the slides that is helpful

00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:12,480
and and it will be attached to the

00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:16,110
website under my name so like if you

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,840
uh-huh like if you go to this session

00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:21,510
don't go today because I'm I will put my

00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,840
organizer hat back on right after this I

00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:27,090
will put that direct link in and it will

00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:31,350
show up that's why it's supposed to work

00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:36,900
I don't know about that cuz I can't

00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:39,030
control everybody yes a lot of the

00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,480
speakers will tweet it out and I will do

00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:45,090
that and I I will tweet the direct link

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,710
to these slides for you but I will also

00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:51,930
add it to the session there's a place to

00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:54,090
do that and it is supposed to then show

00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:57,720
up as a link when like you could go look

00:47:54,090 --> 00:48:00,210
at this session topic today and see blah

00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:03,650
blah blah and there's it should then

00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,650
appear a link somewhere

00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,990
and maintain that's a magical document

00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,080
it is a magical document and to be

00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:22,070
honest with you the the first contract I
