	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:27,180
it is my honor and my privilege to

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:31,170
introduce to you Chris limo his mom gave

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,960
him a knife and she didn't even have to

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,989
explain why she was giving him the knife

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,620
culturally he understood if he got into

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:44,579
a bind if he was going to shame his

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,629
family he knew what to do unfortunately

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,719
his boss his commander in the Japanese

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:56,149
army told him you don't surrender you

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:59,520
don't fail and you don't commit suicide

00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:02,480
we're gonna drop you off you're going to

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,790
go to war you're going to win and

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,630
whatever you do you wait here till we

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,280
come get you

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:16,979
and so Hiro inada was dropped off in the

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,830
Philippines in 1944 there was a group of

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,710
them that were there fighting but by

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,070
December of 44 most of them had been

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,329
killed three of them went and hid up in

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,070
the hills of this particular island and

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:36,030
slowly one got injured the other got

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:40,020
sick and it was just him when the war

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,420
was done less than a year later folks

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,490
drove around in jeeps all over the

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,280
Philippines with bullhorns announcing

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:53,759
you can come out of the hills the war's

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:56,759
over he thought that's a trick so he

00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,259
didn't come out of the hills when they

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,259
dropped pamphlets from planes

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,040
and it said the war is done it ended on

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,890
this state you can come out and he

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:15,650
looked at that flier he didn't like the

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:17,910
font he's like I know that's a trick a

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,310
couple years later they dropped flyers

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,610
in Japanese it's letting them know you

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,380
you can come you can come out he'd

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,350
already been in a few skirmishes right

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,570
fights with the local police fights with

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,900
fishermen down at the wharf and he'd

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,240
even killed some folks he knew he had to

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,000
hide up in those hills and wait for his

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,980
commander he remembered his commanders

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,950
words you don't leave until we come get

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,840
you and so he stayed in the hills every

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,030
now and then sneak out have a little

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,530
fight with the local farmers people who

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,180
were trying to come get him trying to

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,720
say hey it's it's time to come out the

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,310
war is over

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,950
and then a college kid get out from

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,070
Japan looking for hero but he was

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,500
already a myth and legend back in Japan

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:11,180
looking for him and he finds him and he

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,980
says hey the war's been over and he says

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,360
not until my commander comes to pick me

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,540
up and so the caution he flies back to

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,750
Japan gets a hold of the military they

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,530
find his former lieutenant his former

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:32,160
man commander the full commander was now

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,700
grandfather running a book store but

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:42,900
they put him on a plane and flew him out

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:45,690
in March of 1970 for 30 years he'd been

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,450
on that island and they went to find

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,680
Hiro and they told him it's okay you've

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,540
been pardoned for whatever is going on

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,540
in the island it's time to come home

00:03:53,550 --> 00:04:01,710
this morning I want to share with you

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,270
ten mantras personal statements things

00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,830
that I've learned over the last 25 years

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:10,620
that I hope will help you succeed there

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,960
are lots of different ways that we'll

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,410
get you to the point where you call it

00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,680
success I can't prescribe for you all

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:23,910
those different ways but I can tell you

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,490
how you fail I can tell you how you lose

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,390
yourself in the midst of it and I don't

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,170
want that for you

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,940
I wish 25 years ago so I'm gonna sat

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,740
down and given me here are the 10 things

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,600
you need to know I wish that it happened

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,640
these were the lessons that came after

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
lots of time and lots of stories and I

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,880
want to share them with you this morning

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,150
and we'll start with the first one right

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,020
which is just because you believe it

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:55,080
doesn't mean it's true here I genuinely

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,380
thought he was still engaged in a war

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:03,650
for 30 years

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:08,040
and he was wrong for 29 of them my wife

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:12,150
who is absolutely amazing then leaves

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,190
she was fired from a job and it affected

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,990
how she thought about herself and the

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,510
world but she was a school teacher and a

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,990
school teacher at least in California in

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,430
April everybody kind of gets told we're

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,050
not sure if you're coming back unless

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,550
you have tenure

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,530
everybody is quote let go they're not

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,760
actually let go they just have to wait

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,250
till they get the enrollment and then

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:39,510
they offer some people the opportunity

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,210
to come back one year just a few years

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,660
into her career my wife wasn't invited

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:49,860
back can we all be clear that's not the

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,240
same as getting fired they just didn't

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,020
have enough students to bring her back

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,640
and she walked around going I I was

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,740
fired any time someone told a story

00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,750
about a way they were horrific ly fired

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,460
the shame they brought on themselves and

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,110
their family Melissa would start to tell

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:10,259
her story and like note

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:13,650
no no your story is not being fired but

00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:18,870
in her world that was what she told

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:20,479
herself I have some friends who are

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,689
sitting right here in the front table

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,289
who work at a company called ninja forms

00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:30,449
the crazy thing is when they started

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:34,770
there was already a well-known form

00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:36,900
plug-in called gravity forms everybody

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,159
knew who gravity forms was in fact there

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,110
were people who would get on stage

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,599
myself included who would say if you're

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,860
just gonna buy one premium plug-in all

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:45,270
the rest of the plugins are free but if

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:50,969
you're gonna buy just one premium plugin

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:52,710
by gravity forms and James decided with

00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:53,940
a small group of folks let's build a

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,919
different form plug-in let's do it

00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:01,259
differently I am so thankful right but

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,900
he didn't listen to the people who told

00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,240
him there's no point in doing this the

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,379
markets already saturated can you

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,060
imagine we thought the market was

00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:14,400
saturated with one plug-in I think that

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,020
was a long time ago we're like well it

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,960
forms already done go pick something

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,509
else and James like no I I think there's

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,370
room for more I'm not saying that

00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:26,159
everything you believe is wrong I'm just

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,979
saying you need to check yourself and

00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:32,159
the beautiful thing James did with Kevin

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,389
his co-founder is that they had a group

00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:36,419
of people around that they could check

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,560
hey am I crazy about this am i insane

00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,539
thinking that maybe there could be

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,430
another plug-in I have a group of

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,620
friends in the WordPress community that

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,969
I have on speed-dial that I have in text

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,370
message that I have in a slack room

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:50,610
where I get to check myself hey is this

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,889
crazy am i silly for thinking this and

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,219
sometimes they'll go yeah that's that's

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,629
stupid if you don't have a friend who

00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:00,960
will tell you when you're being stupid

00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:03,089
make one today right just walk up to a

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,129
stranger and go oh hi there my name's

00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,690
Chris and I'm wondering if you would

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,060
like to be my friend who tells me when

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm stupid there is no one who doesn't

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,870
sign up for that there is no one who

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,389
like everything I love that I'll tell

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:20,009
everybody they're stupid no no only when

00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:22,409
I'm actually being stupid right but the

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,720
reality is right we need to be able to

00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:31,169
check ourselves because not everything

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:34,349
we believe is true that make sense the

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:36,539
next one was one of those dynamics that

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,669
took a lot of time for me to figure out

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,399
how to sit share or what to say to

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,260
myself but it started quite simply I was

00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,140
in college my last year of college and I

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,820
went to the ATM machine to get money out

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,700
because I was going to have a group of

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,440
friends over for a graduation dinner I'd

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,860
go to the ATM sticking my card punch in

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,500
the code now I was in college so I want

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,779
to be clear my graduation party was

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,279
gonna cost us like 80 bucks all right

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:07,279
and I had maybe like 85 in the bank so I

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:14,070
was like okay and I punched in my code

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:18,990
withdrawal 25 or 80 and I got like eight

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,500
hundred dollars out what the heck is

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,870
this

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:27,779
there were all $100 bills in Atlanta you

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:31,290
may roll with such a bank that kicks out

00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:34,160
hundreds in California it's 20s there

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,160
was clearly a mistake

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,019
and I grabbed the money and I walked

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,180
into the bank and I said hey there's a

00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:44,329
problem there ATM machine it just gave

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:48,709
me hundreds I think I goes we didn't

00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:50,990
give you enough money no no no you you

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:54,230
gave me way more money than I will ever

00:09:50,990 --> 00:10:00,940
see in my life like this this is wrong

00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:00,940
right and so do we have a new one

00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,259
what was I

00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:35,369
eight hundred bucks was more than I'd

00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:39,129
ever seen in my life I think so right so

00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:41,499
I'm like no no this isn't my money right

00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:44,739
and they're like sir you're holding the

00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:45,789
money no but I your machine gave me this

00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:47,169
and it was a mistake

00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:50,829
they're like wait how much were you

00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:54,099
trying to get out $80 and the guy looks

00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:55,839
at me he's like we gave you 800 when you

00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:59,349
asked for 80 and you're standing in

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,239
front of me I'm like well at some point

00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:02,679
you're gonna figure it out and chase me

00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:04,839
down and I don't want to be hiding for

00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,189
the rest of my life not realizing that

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,669
banks don't have bounty hunters right I

00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:12,699
just I was I was young I didn't know so

00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:17,619
I gave the money back and when I told

00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:19,419
some friends they were like wow I never

00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:21,470
really thought of you as that kind of

00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:23,840
guy

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,250
which isn't very nice to say to one of

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:31,670
your friends right but it was the

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:35,210
beginning the kernel of this truth right

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:40,030
that my integrity mattered to me even

00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:42,500
when no one was looking one year later I

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:45,890
was working at a government research lab

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,200
the beginning of my career and I was

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:51,950
working at Berkeley National Lab we were

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,280
literally building the Internet and I

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:59,960
worked for a temp agency for the lab and

00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,730
I got a check now in those days I mean I

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,850
would've been lucky to get like $500 a

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:10,520
week or something and this check was for

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:12,110
like $4,000 and I went oh there's a

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,650
mistake so I went to my boss and I said

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,120
listen I know how many staff are are

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,710
contracted to the lab and if you made

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,780
this if they made this kind of mistake

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,610
times that many people this could be

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,280
like a quarter of a million a half a

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,350
million dollars and he was wait you got

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,620
a check for more that I don't understand

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,870
I said no there's a there could be a big

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,250
problem and so then he said oh I'll go

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,300
talk to the division director I go to

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,320
the division director I'm like hey

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
there's a problem you like we didn't pay

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,420
you enough no that's not what I'm

00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,970
talking about

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,300
right I think there's a big problem in

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:46,010
the system they said I I wouldn't worry

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,490
about it just cash a check and move on

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,350
life I'm like no no no so I went off

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,900
campus down to the office in downtown

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,690
Berkeley and I sat in a room on the

00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,280
chairs waiting to see someone and the

00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,780
first person comes out and says okay

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,980
what's the problem I said what's my

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,260
check we didn't pay you enough no you

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,700
paid me too much and here's what's going

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,310
on and I think this problem could be big

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,630
and they're like I don't understand did

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,250
you got more than you were expecting and

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,040
you're and you're what are you doing

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,500
here no because I there's a problem with

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,470
your I'm worried about you right they're

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,650
like hold on and we went through that

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,570
for three people right I was there for

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,510
like six hours trying to give them money

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,850
back

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,370
but within a few weeks that story got

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,690
around the lab to the point where

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,880
someone in my department who worked in

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,019
my building walked up to me and like did

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,990
you hear about the kid who was doing

00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:42,459
like that's me it is easier the second

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,430
time than the first and it's been easier

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:47,500
every year after that because the story

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,389
I tell myself the one I do believe is

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,899
that even when no one's looking

00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:55,149
my character matters the story I tell

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:57,699
myself is that if people are choosing

00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:00,310
between me and some other candidate for

00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,630
a job that my character is going to

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,570
matter more than my competence and

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,910
here's why I know that's true because

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,600
when I was starting my career Facebook

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:14,610
didn't exist when I was starting to do

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,800
work on the web browsers barely existed

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:21,910
we had to get a new beta version every

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,889
three months everything about what's

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,730
gone on in the tech space even in the

00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:30,190
WordPress space everything changes all

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,220
the time there is no way you're going to

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,290
be an expert in everything you will not

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,810
reach the holy grail of having your

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,790
competence known throughout the world as

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,550
being an expert in all the things that's

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,319
never gonna happen

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,660
but if you have to choose between

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:50,290
developing your competence and your

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,730
character I want to tell you that

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,019
character is more important and I want

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,260
to tell you that it gets easier over

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:58,870
time that's a story you tell yourself

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,899
that you can hold on to does that make

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,899
sense

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,130
now in the midst of talking about things

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,970
we tell ourselves most of the time the

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:14,730
things I tell myself are negative I

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:17,850
don't know about you right but if I come

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,589
off this stage later today and I have 10

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,490
people 15 people walk up going that was

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:22,709
great that was great

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,550
and one person walks up and goes you

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:28,560
know you didn't mention this that's it

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,259
the rest of the day I'm just sitting on

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,630
that negative critic right does that

00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,399
make sense do you do that too right

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,139
we remember the negative far more than

00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,649
the positive and the negative the worst

00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:43,709
negative is our own inner critic that

00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,910
tells us you can't do that I wrote a

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,259
plug-in when I was first getting

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,050
involved in the WordPress community a

00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,819
long time ago I wrote a plug-in and I

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,389
kept telling myself this sucks

00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:57,089
I mean I'm I'm no norcross right he's

00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:58,740
somewhere here my code his code like I

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,740
wrote one plug-in and by that point he'd

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,920
written like 35 right and I just thought

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,610
this and then I got a letter from a

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,800
patent troll that said your your plug-in

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:17,370
is is in jeopardy of one of our patents

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,420
and inside my head I thought see I told

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,660
you this sucked you don't know what

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,399
you're doing now thankfully it was a

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,990
patent troll and not a real deal and so

00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,970
I just closed down the plug and moved on

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,029
in life and tried the next thing I

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,339
created an online course a video course

00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:34,100
on memberships I know a little something

00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,560
about memberships in the WordPress space

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,360
so I created a course and then I thought

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,339
no one's gonna buy this it turned out I

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,399
was mostly right most people didn't buy

00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,600
it from my site but some dude halfway

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,360
across the world had made a copy of

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,550
everything and he was selling it on his

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,170
site and he was making a lot of money

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,420
because he was selling it for $39 when I

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,470
was selling it for $199 and I thought

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,460
see you don't know what you're doing you

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:05,880
should just stop in fact

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,920
I got involved in WordPress 2005 the the

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,630
series of years from then to now has

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,420
always had the you don't really know

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,920
what you're doing maybe the the biggest

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,559
crazy mistake I made in life which

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,839
turned out to not be a mistake at all

00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,819
was I thought hey maybe we could create

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,780
another version of manage WordPress that

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,270
does something different so I joined

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,890
liquid web two years ago and close

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,850
friends you know the ones that tell you

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,070
when you're being stupid they're like

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:33,000
you know there's ten other managed

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,640
WordPress hosting right and you're like

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,809
yeah but I think there's space to do

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,980
some new things and we've had a lot of

00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:41,970
fun over the last two and half years

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,640
there's always going to be an inner

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,730
critic there's always gonna be someone

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,450
telling you even if it's just you that

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,690
you don't know what you're doing that

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,480
you can't pull it off and what you need

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,050
to develop right is a completely

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,960
different approach to navigating your

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,780
inner critic there's an entire field of

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,660
psychology called sports psychology that

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,850
focuses on athletes and what they do to

00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,110
prepare and when I was an athlete in

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,150
high school and it's hard to believe

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:16,020
that this was an athlete at some point

00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,309
in life but I was I had a coach who

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,660
started talking about some of this stuff

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:23,610
right in 1977 they looked at 16 men who

00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,260
were trying for the Olympics trying to

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,230
join the US Olympic team in gymnastics

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,020
in 1977 they released the report that

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:36,800
said they analyzed what they told

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:39,780
themselves what do you say to yourself

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,610
there were some who said nothing some

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,290
who said don't blow it there was a

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:46,230
handful that we're doing the thing that

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,360
was popular in those days vision jumping

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,800
over the bar or vision grabbing onto the

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,559
Rings or vision whatever you do when

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,880
you're in gymnastics but there was the

00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:00,500
fourth group who simply said you've been

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,820
here before you can do this

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,320
just positive encouragement

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,559
self-confidence that maybe they didn't

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,720
have completely but it turns out the

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,700
1977 study has been mirrored over and

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,090
over and over if you're a marathon

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,120
runner

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,830
if you bicycle on the Tour de France the

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,309
notion that you could say I've been here

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,230
before I can do this I've been here

00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:26,360
before I'm gonna make it it's hard but

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:31,460
it won't kill me whatever phrase you

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:36,100
have to beat back your inner critic will

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:38,120
have a positive impact on your life in

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,130
1977 they looked at those 16 male

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,260
athletes it turns out the group that was

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,500
positive self confident telling

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,080
themselves these mantras over and over

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:53,210
they all made the team and they the

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:58,610
others didn't this morning I want you to

00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:00,830
know this I think you're awesome I think

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:04,190
you're fantastic I think you're

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:06,380
incredible you know how I know because

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,620
you got up on a Saturday morning to come

00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,809
to a technology conference there's only

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,289
two options you're amazing or you're

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,289
insane

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,310
if you've spent any time in the

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,650
WordPress community then you likely have

00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:31,700
seen on Twitter somewhere or Facebook or

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:35,250
on a news website the notion of WP drama

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,610
right here's what I bet you have never

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,930
done I bet you've never gone to Google

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:44,520
open up your browser gone to Google and

00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:49,770
typed into the search can be a good rant

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:52,170
today I mean most of us when we get on

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,640
social right we get on social driven by

00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,200
the fact that we had a bad experience at

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,000
a hotel a bad experience at a restaurant

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,050
a bad experience in WordPress a bad

00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,580
experience with a plug-in a bad

00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,480
experience with a host and then we want

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,080
to go somewhere we want to tell the

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,690
world about it

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,870
but none of us ever go to the same sites

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:10,550
go to Google go to social trying to read

00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:13,760
that none of us search for the rant

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:16,850
that's not how we work

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,450
so you may have an opinion

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:24,630
my recommendation is choose wisely if

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,980
you're gonna share it as some very good

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,750
friends who work at a hosting company

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,400
called Dobby Engine they're one of the

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,170
premier players in the WordPress space

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,660
they were one of the early players to

00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:38,100
define managed WordPress and I was one

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:41,190
of their customers and I remember when

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,590
my site started getting 502 airs and I

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,860
called up my friends who worked there

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,900
and I said what's going on and they said

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,250
what are you talking about and I'm like

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,510
how can you be a host and not know that

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:56,940
I'm getting 502 airs and then I had five

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,800
six eight sites with him and every time

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,510
they did an update I didn't get one

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,040
email telling me here are the six sites

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,290
where the eight sites were updated I got

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,750
eight emails one per and I'm like what

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,250
kind of doesn't know to send one

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,400
email instead of eight you're spamming

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,750
my inbox then I joined liquid web and

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,990
started building a new platform called

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:18,880
managed WordPress and guess what oh yeah

00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,560
you get a call from a customer going how

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,200
do you not know that I'm getting 502 s

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm like what what are you talking about

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,880
we update plugins on their site and we

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,350
send out like I have many sites on my

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,660
manager WordPress platform at like a web

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,370
and I had like 30 sites so every night I

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:41,440
get 30 emails telling me what's happened

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:43,810
and I'm like the gods all right thank

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,790
God I didn't write a long post about 502

00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:49,390
errors and multiple emails right because

00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:51,940
that would be comical today don't

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,440
presume right that the person on the

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,990
other end of whatever you're upset about

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,880
did it intentionally to hurt you don't

00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,310
presume that there's a secret cabal

00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,830
making decisions about Kentucky Fried

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:08,170
Chicken recipes and WordPress foundation

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,700
and course it doesn't exist and more

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,530
importantly your rant about it isn't

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,160
helpful because there's always that

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:19,180
person who's brand new to the game

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:22,450
you were once new to the game to imagine

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,010
if you had only read something new about

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,140
Gutenberg that said this thing is

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,940
horrible and the demise of the Republic

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,640
and you're like I should just I should

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,050
just walk away from WordPress now

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,450
because you read someone's rant because

00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,900
you didn't have context for the rest of

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,280
it I left two blog posts about Gutenberg

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,380
over the course of two years one that

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,240
said I don't fully understand what's

00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,320
happening and the second which was oh I

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,730
think I understand what's happening I

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,360
would just shape it a little differently

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,160
that was it - did I have 400 thoughts

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,470
about Gutenberg over the course of the

00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,590
time that it was working absolutely

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,700
I bet you did - and I bet you had those

00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,920
feelings about jetpack and you have

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,480
those feelings about everything else

00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,590
they were in the early early days right

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,080
there were things jetpack did that I

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,220
really didn't love and then the other

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,660
day I started working on a partnership

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,520
with jetpack and one of my friends calls

00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,540
me one of those friends who's like the

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,280
one that will tell you if you're being

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,450
stupid and he goes hey I see you're

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,440
gonna partner with Jeff at can you tell

00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,850
me what's going on I go yeah and I

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,340
explained it all he goes oh that's good

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,390
good call

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:24,310
can you imagine if I'd written the post

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:27,420
that said never touch jetpack

00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:29,380
don't install Guttenberg whatever it is

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,370
there are moments when we can have that

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,720
rant there are moments where we can have

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,170
those feelings be frustrated whatever

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,670
but you don't want to write that post

00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,380
you don't want to share that opinion

00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,770
that way because it'll come home to

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:45,340
roost and one point in that it may

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:47,050
derail someone else you can have all the

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,480
opinions you want my advice to you is

00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:59,320
you don't have to share them all that

00:24:49,480 --> 00:25:01,780
make sense the first time I was offered

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:06,160
a job at Disney we were living in

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:07,680
Northern California I love Disney am my

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,330
wife loves Disney man

00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,900
and I was giving a I was given a job

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:18,670
offer for a senior director at Disney

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:24,010
and I'm like this is amazing and my wife

00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:25,270
said do we get free passes - no but with

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,620
what they're offering to pay me we can

00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:31,120
buy all the passes we want this is

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:35,110
amazing and then we dug in a little and

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,280
she said wait they want us to move I'm

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,050
like yeah we don't have to go down there

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,180
gonna live down in Burbank or whatever

00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:44,410
and nobody chooses to live in Burbank

00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:48,940
right and she's like I don't want to

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:50,290
move and so okay but that I mean you

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,420
know this is affecting my career she's

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:54,220
like well if we have to I'm like no we

00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,490
won't go first time made the decision it

00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:00,660
was a Disney and I said okay we won't

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:03,780
write not a big deal

00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:06,910
got an offer a couple years later from

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:09,550

started they need me to move to Austin I

00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,340

remember today the public restaurant and

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,970
it wasn't strategic we've just happened

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,070
to be a dinner and sitting across from

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,690
my wife when I said hey I'm talking on

00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,610
this hosting company they're looking for

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,500
this role they're excited to have me

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:32,080
come on board but we'd have to move to

00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,790
Austin and her eyes beat it up and the

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,390
tears started coming down her face and I

00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,700
was like whoa

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,870

the friends in the world we want we're

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,080
connected to the church would like

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:50,360
everything is going right and you want

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:57,410
to pull us up and move to Texas I'm like

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:58,730
well when you put it like that so we we

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,440
said no right pulled out the whole

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,900
process that no thanks it was easier the

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,299
second time the third time right before

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,490
I joined Liquid web started talking to

00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,140
Facebook and facings like we're very

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,809
excited to have you potentially do this

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,030
and I said great where is it oh well you

00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:15,549
can either live in San Francisco or

00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:19,610
London

00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:23,490
Wow those are too cheap cities

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:28,500
right and Melissa was like no I don't

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:34,640
want to move and so I said no a lot

00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:39,180
easier the third time my entire career

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:43,830
has not been optimized for my entire

00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:45,960
career you understand the number of jobs

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,910
I've passed the number of companies I've

00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,440
said no to the things that I could have

00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,440
done I could have been a contender

00:27:52,010 --> 00:28:00,300
instead of most happily married man on

00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:05,000
the planet I chose what I believe to be

00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,000
the better choice and if you met my wife

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,470
let me explain to you something we have

00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,200
a strategy for how we build friendships

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,550
in our family right because if you meet

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,680
my wife first and you think she's

00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,620
amazing and then you meet me like we do

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,370
a dinner together couples right 50% of

00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:25,380
the people never eat with us again okay

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,690
but if you know me through WordPress and

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,510
and we're okay we're having fun and then

00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,100
I introduce you to my wife 100% of the

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,810
people will come back in fact some of

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,190
them will volunteer the hey if you guys

00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:40,080
get a divorce I'm going with her I mean

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:44,040
she is the most incredible person in the

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,280
world here's what I know when you're

00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,380
dead and if you have a tombstone

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:53,300
there'll be a start date there'll be an

00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:57,780
end date and there be a - I don't know

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:59,510
what your - will look like but there's

00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:02,040
no titles on your tombstone

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,650
there's no I got to be the SVP of

00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,110
so-and-so I got to be the CEO of sone so

00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,680
there are no titles there if you're

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,720
lucky

00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,610
there'll be a tombstone right next to

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,470
you all I want is one arrow that says

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,470
I'm with her and hers - say I'm with him

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,430
I love my wife if my wife said today I

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,960
need you to leave liquapep I'd leave

00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,630
liquid web without even sending Joe and

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,720
note just walk out the door and just

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:30,000
keep walking that's how much I love my

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,910
wife I love my kids and I love my

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,140
friends and fundamentally right you're

00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,030
gonna have to make a choice is

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,320
optimizing your career the most

00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:41,430
important thing and I will tell you

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:45,690
right now I don't think it is I've been

00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:47,010
in a career for 25 years and I will tell

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,150
you there have been some highs there

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:52,040
been some lows there was some amazing

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:55,920
fun times but I've never regretted

00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,650
making the choices I made to value my

00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:04,140
relationships more than my titles that

00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:06,840
make sense what makes it easier is this

00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,900
truth which is you want to make the work

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,460
the reward now it was a lot of work to

00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,230
get pictures of me that don't have me

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,970
holding a cigar I just want you to

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:20,760
recognize that right all of these people

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:24,660
are WordPress people every single one of

00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,940
them when I got involved in the

00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,310
community which was about 2011 I knew

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:34,010
exactly zero people in the WordPress

00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:37,280
space today 90% of my closest friends

00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:39,540
come from the WordPress community

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,680
frankly if the software falls off the

00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,360
edge of the planet and we don't ever

00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,410
talk about WordPress again these are

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,410
still my closest friends

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,440
when we make the work the reward itself

00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,580
you stop worrying about the objective

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,190
you stop worrying about what hill you're

00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,970
trying to climb and instead you enjoy

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:59,220
the journey right now here's my favorite

00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:02,480
picture if you take a look

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,980
suet says make the work the reward

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,750
that's me and Matt Mullenweg smoking

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,470
cigars you know what makes that

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,610
interesting

00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:14,370
he hadn't smoked cigars for ten years

00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:17,520
right I got to bring the thing I loved

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:19,920
most right my hobby and I was like hey

00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,510
Matt listen can I take you to my cigar

00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,250
lounge in Manhattan my favorite place

00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,660
can I take you there and can I pick your

00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,730
cigar he's like sure let's do it and we

00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,050
smoke cigar and I'm like this is amazing

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,310
and in fact we were having so much fun

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,110
that I forgot to take a picture and then

00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,880
he was like do you think we can get a

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,400
picture I'm like oh sure and so we asked

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,010
the person to come take a shot I I

00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,870
didn't care if I had the picture I'm

00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,880
hanging out with a guy who co-founded

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:48,030
WordPress and he's smoking the cigar

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:51,690
that I selected game over I win right we

00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:55,400
make the work the reward and I promise

00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,400
you it will be roaring

00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:00,769
how many of you have ever played Jenga

00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,149
absolutely you have no lives

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,950
I mean how have you existed without

00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:09,960
playing Jenga if you don't know for the

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,370
uninitiated Jenga is a game where you

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,019
build up a whole bunch of blocks right

00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,429
build the tower and then you play this

00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:17,429
game where each person has to take one

00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:19,080
block out right and you wait to see if

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,820
the tower falls over for those of you

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,039
that have played Jenga how many times

00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,990
when the Jenga thing falls over right

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,059
when the tower is down how many of you

00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,460
have been completely bewildered and

00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:36,029
shocked that this happened to the Jenga

00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:37,529
tower what happens when you it's going

00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:38,700
to fall there's gonna be a moment where

00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:40,289
you grab something you thought was gonna

00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,690
work and it doesn't work it just

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,250
completely crashes and if it does and

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:49,010
you're playing with someone where they

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:51,059
go no I never talk to that person again

00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,919
right I mean that's a ridiculous

00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:54,990
response to the game agenda you know

00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,669
it's gonna fall over you know it's gonna

00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,750
happen to someone you know that someone

00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:59,850
is limited to the number of people

00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,769
playing around the table this is a

00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,210
guarantee and and yet most of us when we

00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:06,210
play we stack it up again and do it

00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,590
again I could talk to you all day about

00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,820
focus I could talk to you all day about

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,029
dedication I could talk to you all day

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,740
about making good choices discernment

00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:15,330
and everything else but I will tell you

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,409
the single thing that has helped me most

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:21,659
in my WordPress career is persistence I

00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:24,120
wrote a blog at Crystal Mikami I blog

00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:28,019
post seven days a week every day for

00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,779
three years every single day trying to

00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:33,059
write to live up to Tom's

00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:35,639
introduction how can I be engaging and

00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:38,820
be helpful and educate all at the same

00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:41,039
time every day you get up you do it you

00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,450
go that's okay that's okay the next day

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,090
you do it again and the next day you do

00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:47,159
it again and you keep doing it and I had

00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,570
friends in SEO who were saying you know

00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,130
that your two posts about membership

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,690
plugins are crashing and Google's not

00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,659
taking credit I'm like I don't write for

00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,370
Google they're like yeah but you didn't

00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,510
get the green light on the I love Yoast

00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,559
he didn't get the green light on that

00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:02,050
article because you didn't write enough

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,120
words I don't care about Yoast I

00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,620
I love I love him he's awesome he's a

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,230
friend of mine but I don't come out of

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,670
software cuz that's not what I was

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,870
writing for I was writing for people and

00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,010
they'll say oh well you didn't do this

00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,690
right there were people who would write

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,580
me posts write write write make comments

00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,560
or write me emails saying you

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,390
capitalized a title wrong you didn't put

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,770
punctuation now as I think you remind me

00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:28,480
how much did you pay for that article oh

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:30,190
that's right you got it for free if

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,540
you're new to WordPress and you have

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,220
comments on your website I want to give

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,290
you this one little hint there is a

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,810
button next to every comment and it lets

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:44,290
you delete the comments and you don't

00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:46,270
need to pay extra for that in my house

00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,860
if you walk in all the food that's

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,030
available in my house is available to

00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,320
you you can walk straight into my

00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,760
refrigerator even if it's the first time

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,050
you've come into my house you can open

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,610
the doors you can grab anything you want

00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,320
there is nothing protected in my house

00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,030
in my house you can sit on any couch

00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,620
there's nothing protected in my house

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,660
any of the musical instruments any of

00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,670
the music speakers anything that I have

00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,050
is available to you if you're in my

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,040
house you can do whatever you want and

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:11,440
there are really no boundaries

00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:15,580
you are welcome in my house as my guest

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:22,960
and if you paint stupid stuff on my

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:24,700
walls I will kick you out my blog

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,990
doesn't have comments where they start

00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,210
doing stupid things because I just

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:31,230
deleted the medicine you just delete the

00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,230
comments you're like no thank you

00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:38,500
persistence is what happens when you

00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:43,570
realize that you will fail and that

00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:45,070
failure is not a big deal when you're

00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,000
playing Jenga and the tower falls over

00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,330
you don't say that's it I'm never

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,950
playing this game again you just rebuild

00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,510
the tower and play it again when I have

00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,710
an idea at work and I think this is the

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,270
most brilliant idea I've ever had and

00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:01,450
then I say it's someone and they're like

00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:02,770
I don't think so I don't just go like

00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,110
okay let's just figure out another way

00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,510
to try it some of you still have key

00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,340
rings with keys I remember when I had a

00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,020
whole bunch of keys and if I took the

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,030
wrong key and put it in the door and it

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,550
didn't open the door I didn't stop and

00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:19,400
go

00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:23,690
I just tried the next key right

00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:27,260
persistence will get you so much more

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,260
than anything else

00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,740
I run a conference you can tell from the

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:43,080
photo that it's super intense

00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:44,310
I run a conference in Kalos and Lukas at

00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,540
a resort where there's no lectures

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,580
there's just a dialogue there's

00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:52,050
discussion and the discussions happen in

00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:55,260
the pool but after years of coaching

00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,910
individual companies right I thought

00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,200
there has to be a way to do this more in

00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,060
mass right bring more people together

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,170
and share more insight it's a business

00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,250
commerce we don't talk about WordPress

00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,360
we don't talk about the technical stuff

00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,770
it's just business

00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,260
pricing hiring all that kind of stuff

00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,870
and I picked my favorite place in the

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,940
world and I invited friends to it and we

00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,170
run that conference the most beautiful

00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,450
thing about the conference is every

00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,030
single time we've run it I think it's

00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:20,940
six years now when people leave they

00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,860
almost never say oh that host that led

00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,150
that discussion was amazing what they

00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,980
say is the person who was sitting next

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,060
to me in the pool they made that comment

00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,710
then I followed up with them and we

00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,320
started talking and I got so much from

00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:33,540
that conversation every participant has

00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,910
their own story now I spend about six

00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,520
weeks curating who's coming to the event

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,560
but every person who shows up has their

00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,160
own story has their own lessons has

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,090
learned something valuable and you're

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,420
just like them

00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:50,190
I think sometimes we look forward and we

00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,300
see people that are no more than us that

00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,400
have figured out more than us that are

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,130
more experts in us and we forget to look

00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,870
back behind us because there's a whole

00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,920
mob of people behind us that have barely

00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:03,240
started and know a lot less than us

00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,740
getting help from other people raising

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,440
your hand and asking for help got you to

00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,000
where you are today don't forget it and

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,530
remember there are people behind you

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,530
that you can help does that make sense

00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:27,680
in my world I generally look at what I'm

00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:30,589
doing in this paradigm that says I

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,050
believe every one of you has a piece to

00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:34,280
the puzzle that we're building but some

00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,280
of you have taken your piece of the

00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,750
puzzle and stick it in your pocket some

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,089
of you for whatever insecurity would

00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,770
ever fear whatever anxiety you have have

00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:44,390
taken your piece of the puzzle and stuck

00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,180
it in your pocket and you're not playing

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,640
the game and the way in which I see my

00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,480
life my mission my purpose is to help

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:56,030
you play your piece my wife loves

00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,619
puzzles when we go on a cruise we play

00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,390
with puzzles right she gets the box she

00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,369
lays it out the worst thing that ever

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,990
happens to her right is when you get the

00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:05,210
puzzle pretty much all done except

00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,740
there's one missing piece and then she's

00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,720
so mad she talks about it the whole rest

00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,010
of the cruise it happened recently at

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,300
our house she bought a puzzle she did

00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,619
with my son and at the end there were

00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,000
two pieces missing and I might just buy

00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,140
the puzzle again find the two pieces she

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,119
goes do you know how hard that will be

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:20,349
I'm like do you know how hard it is to

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,349
listen to you talk about a puzzle

00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:29,500
here's what I know right if you have a

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,090
purpose if you're clear on that purpose

00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,740
if you know what you're going after it

00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,700
will develop a platform of people that

00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,800
are interested in what you're doing and

00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,570
they will listen to you but if you have

00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,120
a platform whether you're famous on

00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,980
Twitter or Facebook or Pinterest or

00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,850
YouTube or whatever that doesn't

00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:49,690
automatically give you a purpose so

00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:51,010
choose wisely and invest this morning I

00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,550
want to wrap up with one last little

00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:57,490
story the Concord is a plane that used

00:39:54,550 --> 00:40:00,310
to take what was a 17 hour journey down

00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:03,310
to seven hours absolutely incredible

00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:06,190
but because it moved at Mach 2 speeds

00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,510
the fuel distribution that had to move

00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:09,760
from the frontal plane to the back of

00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,740
plane at certain timings to get it to

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,630
elevate it would change its weight and

00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,760
it could still maneuver was super

00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,590
complicated so there were two computers

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,720
in the front - even though there were

00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,370
pilots the computers did a majority of

00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,170
the work the pilots would do the work to

00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:25,240
get it taken off but all the rest of

00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,590
that moving fuel back and forth figuring

00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,630
out the elevation everything was done by

00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,160
two computers and the two computers the

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,330
the first one did all the work and the

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,120
second computer was there as the backup

00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:36,310
but every now and then or in fact 200

00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,380
times on the plane the plane would veer

00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,240
off course a little bit the flight was

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,790
so long right to get from say JFK to

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,040
London was so long that they they didn't

00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,060
have memory that we have today so they'd

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,070
have these little memory sticks that

00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,690
they have to put in memory at different

00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,040
points because what would happen as the

00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,380
plane was flying is they would get to a

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,090
certain way point at a certain time and

00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,040
they would calculate where are you

00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,510
supposed to be and where where are you

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,770
and they would notice the plane was off

00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,990
a little bit and they would send back

00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,100
data to the plane saying make the course

00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,600
correction the second computer would

00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:08,140
tell the first computer you have to

00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:10,030
adjust and that would happen over and

00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,260
over and they get a little further in

00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,970
the plane they'd swap out the memory and

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,490
it would do it again and it would do it

00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,420
again and it would do it again and

00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,330
passengers sitting in the back could

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,370
sometimes hear the computer saying out

00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,840
loud right hey course correction they

00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,340
needed course correction adjustment

00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,500
needed course correction adjustment and

00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,700
the pastor's like this is crazy

00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,180
that happened the whole flight this is

00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,180
insane

00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:37,700
the Concord from New York to London

00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:41,310
never was late more than three minutes

00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:45,120
it is incredible what tiny little

00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:49,050
changes and course corrections can do to

00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,460
get you where you want to go but you

00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:54,990
need to know that it's fine to make

00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,090
those course corrections I use this as

00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:00,470
my mantra for lots of little statements

00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:03,300
things like hey seek to be understood

00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:05,550
listen to understand rather than

00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,320
listening to reply all the platitudes

00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,390
you see on Twitter I just punch them all

00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,930
up into hey if you make lots of small

00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:16,590
tweaks and corrections it's amazing what

00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:19,200
results you can have IBM did a study 20

00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:22,860
25 years ago now that was looking at the

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,600
efficacy of delegating giving someone

00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,340
else the Java and they they came back

00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,530
IBM Global Services at the time was

00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,260
massive it were huge company of

00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:33,720
consultants and they said tell us when

00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,980
is it right to delegate and the

00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,840
consultant company came back and said

00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,010
we're gonna give you the answer a little

00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,130
different than you thought we're gonna

00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:43,050
give it to give it to you in a multiple

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,550
and you know what's the multiple yeah

00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,560
well think about how long it would take

00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:49,320
you to do something if you pass it on to

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,960
someone else how long would it take them

00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,330
and there's a there's a point where you

00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,860
stop delegating most of us if you asked

00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,990
us you know at what point do you stop

00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,640
delegating we'd be like well two times

00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,750
maybe three times like it if it takes me

00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,800
one day and it takes um three days I

00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,240
might just give it back to me I'll take

00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:08,960
care of myself do you know what the

00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,960
answer was the multiple ten

00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:15,260
ten someone would take 10 times as long

00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:19,190
and that was still a good time to

00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:22,040
delegate and you go that's crazy except

00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:23,270
it turns out it never stays it then the

00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,400
first time you give it to them it takes

00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:29,540
ten the next time seven the next time

00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,570
three and maybe the next time half they

00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:36,350
just may be better at it than you

00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:38,000
I read that study 25 years ago and I was

00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,680
like sweet I'm gonna delegate everything

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,150
and I have I've tried to delegate as

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,010
much as I can as often as I can

00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,460
even when inside I'm like oh I could do

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:49,460
it better cuz you know what happens we

00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:53,480
forget how long it took us to learn

00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:56,600
something I started working with

00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,450
WordPress in 2005 the UI of 2005 looked

00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,920
really different than it does today but

00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,480
every year from 2005 to now when we've

00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,220
made adjustments those adjustments to me

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,960
have been tiny increments and I've just

00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,430
gone oh okay and I rolled with it but

00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,770
someone today who starts with WordPress

00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:12,320
from the beginning is like ah I don't

00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:13,610
know what to do now we're working on

00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,990
that and there's lots of tools that help

00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:18,620
with that in training and all that but

00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:21,890
the point is we forget so we say stupid

00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:23,870
things like oh we're press is easy when

00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:28,580
my wife logs in and she's like mmm I

00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:29,570
don't know what to do here remember that

00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,480
there are people at the beginning of

00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:35,060
their journey and you can come alongside

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,830
and help them and if that's not

00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,990
something you're doing then I want to

00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:41,840
tell you that tiny little tweaks can

00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:44,090
have an incredible impact in your career

00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,130
and in your life my name is Chris lemma

00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,600
I'm the VP of products over at liquid

00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,980
web you can find me at twitter at at

00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,240
chris i'm a thank you and have a great
